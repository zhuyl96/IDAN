0,"as a fan of the first three books, particularly eclipse, i truly anticipated breaking dawn. now i wish that i had stopped with eclipse and left bella and edward's future to my imagination.while i don't think breaking dawn warrants 1 star, there are too many problems with the plot, consistency, characters and overall writing for me to justify awarding more than 2 stars. after reading the various q&a's stephenie gave after breaking dawn's release, i can begrudgingly overcome some of these problems, but there are too many others, including a monumentally disappointing final ""battle.""*spoilers!*  this is one long novel--not just in page count, but in terms of readers' patience, as well. perhaps if it was split into two novels, the author could spend more time incorporating explanations for problematic plot twists--renesme?--and strengthening character development rather than explaining herself endlessly after the book's publication. i didn't feel an overall arc to the plot--rather, this was like hitting key points in bella's life (here's where she got married, where she first had sex, where she got pregnant, where she gave birth and was transformed, where she hunted, ad infinitum). there wasn't any thread throughout until partway through book three, when the !volturi! threat began---and fizzled out.the wedding was disappointing; i would have expected far more details given the level of anticipation for this event. there's no description of the wedding dress--but there was for alice's outfit! renee was a joke--flies in for the day of the wedding, with just enough time to help bella put some combs in her hair, and that's it? jasper, the vampire with the most difficulty with humans, picked her and phil up from the airport? rose did bella's hair--with little explanation why she was suddenly nice? or was this a ham-fisted attempt at foreshadowing their pregnancy partnership?the volturi were a great addition to the books--the ""vampire police"" were a fascinating concept and i enjoyed learning more about their backgrounds, operations, and the question of their true motivations where the cullens/renesme were concerned. however, the final confrontation was so drawn out it became boring. we learned more about them before the confrontation than we did during the confrontation itself. finally, when it looked like the payoff would take place (renesme and jacob run-off; everyone declares their last words of love), alice swoops in with another half-vamp and aro says ""my bad, nothing to see here, move on!"" everyone cheers and leaves, yet don't we suspect that the volturi will somehow exact revenge on the witnesses? it's all very unresolved and unsatisfying.also problematic in book three is the sudden introduction of a plethora of new vampires and superpowers. while it's exciting to witness more interaction with the denali clan, it's difficult to keep everyone straight (thus the index--maybe that should have been a sign!). book three is a dramatic departure from everything before: a new major character (renesme) and tens of new minor characters; supervampbella who behaves opposite of human bella; half the characters have some type of superpower they practice with each other; all the rules are changing (bella's ""private mind"" can be breached by renesme; newborns don't really need to be so bloodthirsty; werewolves are really shapeshifters; packs can break apart, reform, communicate, not communicate in whatever fashion is convenient for the plot; etc.), charlie's okay with all the supernatural weirdness; there are several half-breeds alive, if you just know where to look; etc.i expected bella to change in obvious and less-obvious ways after becoming a vampire, but almost nothing of human bella continued in supervampirebella. it's not enough that her clumsiness is gone now that everything physical is easy; bella is extraordinarily beautiful, has what turns out to be the most helpful superpower in the confrontation by extending it out to everyone she wishes, can let edward into her thoughts, has almost no insecurities anymore, can easily and smoothly charm a lawyer, and has perfect self-control from day one.i know we're to buy that because bella has mentally prepared to become a vegetarian vampire she can go without the typical newborn process, but she goes to carlisle lengths, and carlisle is to be extraordinary among vampires. she doesn't twitch or cry out in pain during her transformation, she stops mid-first hunt and runs away from human temptation--a feat edward claims even mature vampires sometimes can't do, and can balance her ""distractions"" (i.e., need for blood, sex) from the very first day--a process that edward, again, claims often takes years to achieve. bella even learns to manipulate and extend her superpower in a very short amount of time. so easy for her--no true obstacles, she just rationally decides how she wants it to be, and makes it so. not only is bella unrelatable because she is no longer human, she's not even a particularly relatable vampire!after all the build-up over concerns about moving to alaska and avoiding people, bets on casualties, etc., bella is ""herself"" and in perfect control of her bloodlust, plus the nifty bonus that she still wants edward above all desires from the very moment he kisses her. no more mentions of edward's concern about damned souls or lost humanity, no real mourning over losing face-to-face contact with renee--after all, she has charlie again! so, where's the drama? oh, right, with the volturi. and all they needed was a group of superfriends and a deuce ex-machina in the form of a south american vampire/human.charlie wasn't himself--since when does a chief of police not know how to get info from the cdc? jake transforms in front of him (and isn't that a big no-no? some of the werewolves' parents don't even know!) and he takes it calmly--just don't tell him more than he needs to know! again, he's the chief of police--yes, he's always overlooked many things he doesn't really want to think about, but doesn't he have some concern about public safety, what with huge wolves around?and what about those ""werewolves?"" after the massive build-up and tension in book two over the pack split, a quick sentence or two from bella reveals that suddenly everyone is happy again  because jake imprinted on renesme. all the discord in lapush and among the werewolves and between sam's pack and the cullens is brushed away like it never really happened. so happy is everyone, in fact, that sam and jake can communicate telepathically, but only what they want, when they want. convenient. also, why the big reveal that they are actually ""shapeshifters?"" what purpose does that serve? it's random and unsettling, dropped in just at the end of the story.the writing itself was subpar: vague, little variety in adjectives, poor grammar and spelling, stale dialogue. bella doesn't stop to reflect on her experiences or behavior. book two sloshes through repetitive mush of how much physical pain bella is in, how much psychological pain jake and edward are in, how dangerous the situation is, etc. throughout books two and three, conversations tend to drag on, particularly between the wolves, yet by the end, there's little discussion between bella and edward of their new reality as parents and how it has presumably changed their relationship.finally, as many have mentioned, there is the problem of the ending itself. i'm all for happy endings, but we've been told in these novels for so long that there will be consequences to bella's choices. there's absolutely no realism left by book three, no satisfying payoff to the volturi conflict, and then bella ends up with everything she could possibly want, with no compromises, no consequences, and nothing negative for any of the forks/lapush crowd.in the end, there were a few scenes that worked for me--isle esme, the birth, the transformation, the final scene with bella and edward---but not enough to rise above a meager 2-star review.","a a fan of the first three books, particularly eclipse, i truly anticipate break dawn. now i wish that i have stop with eclipse and leave bella and edward's future to my imagination.while i don't think break dawn warrant 1 star, there be too many problem with the plot, consistency, character and overall write for me to justify award more than 2 stars. after read the various q&a's stephenie give after break dawn's release, i can begrudgingly overcome some of these problems, but there be too many others, include a monumentally disappoint final ""battle.""*spoilers!* this be one long novel--not just in page count, but in term of readers' patience, a well. perhaps if it wa split into two novels, the author could spend more time incorporate explanation for problematic plot twists--renesme?--and strengthen character development rather than explain herself endlessly after the book's publication. i didn't feel an overall arc to the plot--rather, this wa like hit key point in bella's life (here's where she get married, where she first have sex, where she get pregnant, where she give birth and wa transformed, where she hunted, ad infinitum). there wasn't any thread throughout until partway through book three, when the !volturi! threat began---and fizzle out.the wed wa disappointing; i would have expect far more detail give the level of anticipation for this event. there's no description of the wed dress--but there wa for alice's outfit! renee wa a joke--flies in for the day of the wedding, with just enough time to help bella put some comb in her hair, and that's it?

1,"after years of hearing this graphic novel lauded as one of the greatest comics of all time (and admittedly intrigued by the buzz surrounding the upcoming film adaptation), i finally sat down and read alan moore and dave gibbons' magnum opus.  and i was blown away.  absolutely, completely enthralled and blown away by this ""comic book"" that transcends the boundaries and stigmas attached to its medium to become a truly compelling piece of literature, as stimulating and thought provoking as the works of dickens or faulkner.i should point out that while i have always been a fan of superheroes, i am not an avid comic book reader; in fact, ""watchmen"" is the first graphic novel i've ever purchased.  i state this to illustrate that this is a work that can be enjoyed by anyone, not just comic book enthusiasts.  everything about this book, even 20+ years after its original publication, is thrillingly fresh and compelling.  set in an alternate 1985 where richard nixon is serving his third term as president, one of the novel's many pleasures is seeing just how thoroughly thought out every aspect of this alternate history is.  the story begins with the murder of a former masked hero (the book fittingly avoids the term ""superhero,"" as only one of the characters has supernatural abilities), and what starts as a whodunit quickly escalates into a meditation on power, government, politics, technology, and the direction humanity is headed.  yes, the cold war-era nuclear-holocaust material slightly dates the tale, but the theme of mankind's ever growing ability to destroy ourselves is still relevant today.yet for all its philosophizing, ""watchmen"" remains firmly grounded in character study, and the costumed adventurers found withing are given incredibly complex psychologies.  everyone is a realistically flawed human being doing their best to figure out their place in the world.  by the novel's end, you come to understand all the characters, even the ones who have done the most horrific things (including an attempted rape and some graphic murders).  moore and gibbons do not pass judgment on their characters, leaving the reader to ultimately decide how he or she feels about each one.the way the narrative is told is absolutely riveting, filled with flashbacks and concurrent scenes juxtaposed to maximum artistic effect.  and in between each chapter is a wealth of supplemental materials to fill in the gaps of the novel's backstory, each done in the fashion of  publications that exist in the watchmen world (newspaper clippings, excerpts from fake novels, etc.).  and artist dave gibbons expertly supports moore's text with detailed artwork packed with symbolism and hidden meanings.  you could easily spend hours pouring over the panels to find small symbolic details and hints of future plot twists.  the final panel alone masterfully and succintly brings the work full-circle and is chilling in its implications.in short, anyone who is a fan of literature (not just comic books) needs to read ""the watchmen.""  while i have high hopes for the film adaptation, it cannot hope to match the complexity, breadth, and depth of the source material.  this is one of the most stimulating books i have read in a long time, and i cannot recommend it highly enough.","after year of hear this graphic novel laud a one of the greatest comic of all time (and admittedly intrigue by the buzz surround the upcoming film adaptation), i finally sit down and read alan moore and dave gibbons' magnum opus. and i wa blow away. absolutely, completely enthral and blow away by this ""comic book"" that transcend the boundary and stigma attach to it medium to become a truly compel piece of literature, a stimulate and think provoke a the work of dickens or faulkner.i should point out that while i have always be a fan of superheroes, i be not an avid comic book reader;

1,"the flip mino is small--very small and very light weight. it fits comfortably in my pocket and isn't a bother to tote around for hours at a time. the soft pouch that comes with it is very handy and can double as a cloth for wiping fingerprints and smudges off of the unit and screen.the video quality is good--like a vhs tape that's been used over-and-over again, but with pixely artifacts, rather than a drifting image and fuzz. if you keep the camera still and if the subject of the shot isn't moving too much and if the lighting is decent, the image quality is really quite good--i would compare it to standard definition television. overall, it's better than your average youtube video. and though the image does become grainy in low light, it's still suitable for capturing candid moments. the sound quality is also good and the microphone is suitably sensitive. it picks up quiet speech without too much background noise and there is never a hiss or buzz.i put together a 30 minute video for slg publishing that was shot entirely with the flip mino at comic-con international 2008. i used my macbook pro (the newest 15 inch version--purchased in may of 2008) and i edited the video with imovie. i had to install the flip video codec that came on the camera's flash drive and i updated imovie to the latest version of the software, 7.1.4. after taking these steps, everything worked great. i found that the best way to manage the video was to import it using iphoto (my macbook pro recognized the flip as a camera and automatically opened iphoto to import the video). imovie will then add the video to its library for editing.overall, my experience with the flip mino has been very possitive. it works as it is supposed to and that's really what i want when i buy electronics.here's a link to the first part of the video that i made. it might help you to see what the video quality looks like. however, the video has been compressed a second time and is not indicative of the native video quality of the flip.

 we ate them, we liked them!  i didn't have any issues with them cooking unevenly; each batch turned out just fine.yesterday my husband made grilled cheese using the steak plate and the baking tray (upper & lower).  he tells me that he flipped it over so he'd have the same design on each side *insert rolly eyes here*, but otherwise it cooked just fine.last night i made chocolate chip cookies using the recipe from the cookbook that came with the grill.  so cool!  they were virtually impossible to screw up!  i did cook them longer than the recipe called for after the first batch; cooking times i think are are things that will have to be judged individually for each recipe.  there are guidelines in the cookbook and the instruction manual, but i don't think they're hard and fast.  experiment and see what works best for you :-)this morning my husband was at it again, this time making scrambled eggs.  i didn't get any (he ate them all while i was asleep!) but he says that they cooked the eggs in about 1/3 of the time as our gas stove.  he was pretty happy with that.i was pleased with the 2 drip trays and the better spatulas (also 2) that came with the grill, in addition to the cleaning sponge.  i don't know how often i'll use the sponge, since the plates clean so easily by hand (and once again, they are dishwasher-safe!), but it's nice to have.  i liked the other foreman grills, but cleaning them stopped me from using them as often as i might have otherwise.  they were just kind of a pain; if you've used them you know what i mean.get this grill :-)  if you have realistic expectations and are willing to experiment to get just the right cooking times, then i don't think you'll be disappointed.  i'm not!","i hear a commercial for this about 3 or 4 time one evening, and i finally pay attention after barely listen to it the first few times. once i saw that it have interchangeable, *dishwasher-safe* plates, i tell my husband that i want it for christmas. i pop over here to amazon and order it right away. it get here before christmas, but since it wa my gift, i have to leave it alone until afterwards ;-)a few thing attract me to the grill. interchangeable plates, dishwasher safe, and the waffle plates. i have be look for a new wafflemaker, and in fact have look at the store the night i saw the ad for the g5. the one we've have for 11+ year be too small for our family now, and i want something bigger. however, it seem silly to spend a lot of money on one since i don't make them that often. imagine how happy i wa to see the size of the plate on the commercial! let me tell you, i wa not disappoint with my first waffle go-round a couple of day ago. it make 2 waffle that be each just about the size of 2 typical square freezer waffles. that's what i'm talk about! i make up a batch of bisquick waffle batter, and set to cooking. it wa trial and error a far a learn cook times. i like my waffle softer, my husband like them crispier. i would say on average they need to cook 5-7 minutes. i pre-heated the grill a directed, and pour about 1.5 ladle of batter on each side. i didn't get them perfectly full each time, but close enough, you know?

0,"this review is from: the dark knight (two-disc special edition + digital copy) (dvd)      heath ledger is dead, and this is the role that, more or less, lead to his death. he showed promise with brokeback mountain and in the dark knight he cements the fact that he was more than just that guy from that teen movie that was based on a work by shakespeare, but it won't happen.oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than ledger's pitch perfect performance. it needs to be said: christian bale cannot act; ok he did a marvelous job in the prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently. he's a horrid batman, not as bad as clooney, but he's still unwatchable. batman's supposed to have a gruff voice, i know this, but it's not supposed to sound like he's belching his lines, it's that simple.for a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.i'm sick of morgan freeman always, always, playing the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserved manner; does the man have no range? please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old. maggie gyllenhall was absolutely awful as well, my lord, the bad performances are everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edited it to the point where it's all ledger's show and nothing else.the directing was nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective is marred by the fact that it's just not well written or acted or directed. for an action film it certainly was incredibly tedious and unbearably slow.nobody better try to feed me anything about this being a character study, or a comic book movie for adults; because it's not, you're fooling yourself if this is your frame of mind. it's a popcorn movie, a summer cash in, and nothing more; well, there's the cornerstone of nihilism that is the joker, but other than that you're better off watching killer klowns from outer space.","this review be from: the dark knight (two-disc special edition + digital copy) (dvd) heath ledger be dead, and this be the role that, more or less, lead to his death. he show promise with brokeback mountain and in the dark knight he cement the fact that he wa more than just that guy from that teen movie that wa base on a work by shakespeare, but it won't happen.oddly enough, this isn't the only sadden part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than ledger's pitch perfect performance. it need to be said: christian bale cannot act; ok he do a marvelous job in the prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently. he's a horrid batman, not a bad a clooney, but he's still unwatchable. batman's suppose to have a gruff voice, i know this, but it's not suppose to sound like he's belch his lines, it's that simple.for a film that's over 2 hour long it sure promise a lot, build up a great deal of expectation and then just completely fizzle by the end of it.i'm sick of morgan freeman always, always, play the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserve manner; doe the man have no range? please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old. maggie gyllenhall wa absolutely awful a well, my lord, the bad performance be everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edit it to the point where it's all ledger's show and nothing else.the direct wa nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective be mar by the fact that it's just not well write or act or directed. for an action film it certainly wa incredibly tedious and unbearably slow.nobody better try to fee me anything about this be a character study, or a comic book movie for adults; because it's not, you're fool yourself if this be your frame of mind. it's a popcorn movie, a summer cash in, and nothing more; well, there's the cornerstone of nihilism that be the joker, but other than that you're better off watch killer klowns from outer space.",dark back in the dark just base odd sad pretty perfect need marvelous apparently horrid bad still ill able sound like simple long great expectation completely free old wise insightful sigh absolutely awful well basically to the point thin dire fit minute attempt deep philosophical certainly incredibly tedious ably slow low boo your mind ace

0,"this review is from: the dark knight (two-disc special edition + digital copy) (dvd)      we've all seen the movie (many of us multiple times) and the general consensus is that the film will be winning many awards. no need to keep repeating what everyone already knows. this is simply a review of the dvd, not the movie. let's get right to the point..the dark knight two-disc special edition + digital copy  has nothing special in it. this ""special edition"" dvd has no directors and/or cast commentary, no deleted or extended scenes, no cast commentary, no behind the scenes or the making of feature, and no special effects behind the scenes feature. basically everything you would expect to come in a dvd (especially a two-disc) is not in this one. if you only watched the 2nd disc of this two-disc edition you would never know that the late heath ledger was in it. there is no tribute or in memory of or any type of mention of heath ledger's death in this dvd. we all know we bought this dvd the day it came out assuming there would be more scenes of ledger's ""joker"" or some type of interview or extra footage of ledger on set. instead all we get with this dvd is basically the movie we saw in the summer transferred to a disc for us to take home. i could have just brought a camera to the theaters and taped it myself if i would have known that's all i would be getting by paying another $20 for this so called ""special edition"" dvd.it is quite clear that the powers that be at warner brothers looked to capitalize even further on the box office success of the ""dark knight"" by pumping out this lame excuse for a dvd just in time for the holiday season knowing that we would eat up the dvd just as fast as we did with the film in the theaters. what's even more disheartening is that in about 3 months times from now, when the ""dark knight"" buzz has died down after the holidays and after the awards season, warner brothers will release the ""ultimate edition"" or ""extended edition"" dvd, whatever they end up calling it, this will be the dvd we all thought we were buying the first time around. knowing that the film very well could walk away with a couple oscars, a rerelease immediately following is a definite. we all saw the film enough times in theaters that we deserve a worthy dvd with all the appropriate features that compliments the film. screw you warner brothers, i want my money back.","this review be from: the dark knight (two-disc special edition + digital copy) (dvd) we've all see the movie (many of u multiple times) and the general consensus be that the film will be win many awards. no need to keep repeat what everyone already knows. this be simply a review of the dvd, not the movie. let's get right to the point..the dark knight two-disc special edition + digital copy ha nothing special in it. this ""special edition"" dvd ha no director and/or cast commentary, no delete or extend scenes, no cast commentary, no behind the scene or the make of feature, and no special effect behind the scene feature. basically everything you would expect to come in a dvd (especially a two-disc) be not in this one. if you only watch the 2nd disc of this two-disc edition you would never know that the late heath ledger wa in it. there be no tribute or in memory of or any type of mention of heath ledger's death in this dvd. we all know we buy this dvd the day it come out assume there would be more scene of ledger's ""joker"" or some type of interview or extra footage of ledger on set. instead all we get with this dvd be basically the movie we saw in the summer transfer to a disc for u to take home. i could have just bring a camera to the theater and tap it myself if i would have know that's all i would be get by pay another $20 for this so call ""special edition"" dvd.it be quite clear that the power that be at warner brother look to capitalize even further on the box office success of the ""dark knight"" by pump out this lame excuse for a dvd just in time for the holiday season know that we would eat up the dvd just a fast a we do with the film in the theaters. what's even more dishearten be that in about 3 month time from now, when the ""dark knight"" buzz ha die down after the holiday and after the award season, warner brother will release the ""ultimate edition"" or ""extended edition"" dvd, whatever they end up call it, this will be the dvd we all think we be buy the first time around. know that the film very well could walk away with a couple oscars, a rerelease immediately follow be a definite. we all saw the film enough time in theater that we deserve a worthy dvd with all the appropriate feature that compliment the film. screw you warner brothers, i want my money back.",dark general ill award need keep simply right to the point thin dire basically expect set just quite clear look to even lame excuse in time hate first round well low definite worthy appropriate prop compliment want back
1,"ok.so i was initially looking at the wireless-n version of this router, to potentially replace my old wrt54gs (linksys wireless g router with speedbooster).  that router had problems, admittedly so.  it worked, but not as well as i'd liked given my setup.  since all of my devices are either g or b wireless, i figured i would just settle for the g router and save money (this one is almost half the cost of the n router).for the record i've got a laptop (wireless), media server (wireless), ps3 (wireless), psp (wireless), ds (wireless), eee pc (wireless), ps2 (hardwire), 360 (hardwire), printer (hardwire), and directv hr20 (hardwire).  yeah, i know.  what's important: the media server is in the master bedroom's closet, far from the router, which is in the living room.  with my old router, signal strength got weak through walls, extremely weak.  local network activity was painful, streaming movies from the media center was painful as it would frequently lock up and stutter; thumbnails would not load.enter this router.  first thing to note: the cd is not required.  if you're new to wireless connections you may want to just follow the directions and cd, but if you're comfortable with navigating the router web interface, just bypass the cd and set it up like you normally would; it'll work.  setup was quite painless and recognition was fast, i managed to replace my old wireless network in a matter of minutes.  there is also a feature that allows for a wifi protected setup with a one-button press, but apparently the receivers require that feature to be built in as well - and none of mine did.  therefore i just ignored it.  for those who are setting up for the first time and bought receivers with the feature included, they might find it useful when doing the setup.i immediately noticed an improvement in the local networking speed.  the aforementioned media server is now screaming fast over the network; thumbnails load just as fast as if i'm at the machine, file transfers are nowhere near as slow and streaming content plays with minimal lag.  internet connectivity was also slightly improved on devices that were not close to the router.there are a couple of issues, not necessarily the router's fault, but more an issue with the way linksys designs them.  first, getting internet connectivity took way too long and was not as easy as it should have been.  i had to powercycle my modem to get it to pull the ip information - even though the details should have easily been accessible from the previous router having gotten them.  this might be a time warner issue rather than a linksys issue - maybe it sees a different mac and freaks, but i doubt it.  once i got the ip information, the router still would not give internet connectivity for a minute.  i'm using vista premium so i can tell when it's ""local"", ""internet"" or both and it struggled to get both up.second, and a minor nitpick at best, the power cord is easily half the size of the wrt54gs.  for the life of me i can't understand this.  it makes it hard for me to locate the router in a good place, because i like to have the router on the ups, and by shortening the cord i have to have the router in the middle of the floor.  minor issue, but still a problem for me.otherwise, i highly recommend this.  it seems they fixed the majority of the problems the previous devices had.  i noted that the negative reviews came from people who had support problems; i never call the bombay support line, so i have nothing bad to say.","ok.so i wa initially look at the wireless-n version of this router, to potentially replace my old wrt54gs (linksys wireless g router with speedbooster). that router have problems, admittedly so. it worked, but not a well a i'd like give my setup. since all of my device be either g or b wireless, i figure i would just settle for the g router and save money (this one be almost half the cost of the n router).for the record i've get a laptop (wireless), medium server (wireless), ps3 (wireless), psp (wireless), d (wireless), eee pc (wireless), ps2 (hardwire), 360 (hardwire), printer (hardwire), and directv hr20 (hardwire). yeah, i know. what's important: the medium server be in the master bedroom's closet, far from the router, which be in the live room. with my old router, signal strength get weak through walls, extremely weak. local network activity wa painful, stream movie from the medium center wa painful a it would frequently lock up and stutter;

0,"i really liked twilight (never as good as any of the hps, but it was a good book), but after new moon i knew i would hate the rest of the series-- and i do! i hope meyers would fix all the problems in her storyline, but it seems her mind- at least in writing this series is as weak and flawed as her characters! i suppose it all was just a weak rip off of wuthering heights and romeo and juliet, but it lacks enough back-story to allow the reader to understand why so many of the characters are so pathetic, especially the main character, isabella. you'll end up not liking her more so than sympathizing with her, and her man, edward goes from being the sharp, keen type, to a pillar to hold up the asinine bella.**series recap**bella is totally pathetic, she's a weak, selfish, flimsy woman. she falls for the vampire who tries to no avail to convince her life is worth living. he leaves her to protect her, but she will only allow herself to believe he left because she is so worthless! (which, as the series goes on, you may believe she is.) through the series bella laments time and time again, how unworthy she is, and constantly has some man to remind her of her importance! if you have a daughter with any kind of self-esteem issue please keep these books away from her!! bella uses the young and innocent native american (jacob) as a crutch to survive her depression. she knows he loves her but won't deny herself the relief she gets from presence even though she knows she her only love is the vampire (edward).jacob risks his life time and time again to protect her, he's called to duty in the first place because of her relationship with edward. despite all jacob gives to bella as soon as edward needs her she tosses jacob to the side to rescue edward. when edward vows to never leave her again, she more or less forgets jacob, there are some extenuating circumstances but still she does not put up the fight for him that she put up to have edward in her life. she disrespects her father, lies to her mother, and does all the things that would break any parent's heart to be with the vampire, and no matter how much she'll think of her poor parents, they're always some kind of afterthought. granted, in the first book she tries to save her mom, but you'll soon see, if confronted with the idea of leaving edward to spare them, she'll leave them to have edward.bella refuses to accept that she cannot have both edward and jacob as they are mortal enemies, she's determined to have things her way and actually feels like jacob is wrong for not giving her what she wants, which is to be her best friend while she loves the vampire...to make matter worse jacob's people have always existed to protect mankind, while edward is just an oddity who no-longer tries to destroy humanity. through the series bella causes trouble time and time again, but is always rescued. she never develops any self-esteem or any ability to take care of herself. at one point, she actually risks her life just to have delusions of edward. she doesn't care about how her parents, or jacob, who she uses to help induce these hallucinations, would feel if she died. she doesn't even care that she could be risking jacob's life too! she abandons her friends and her family to be with edward, who never really requested that of her. edward has to fight with her to attend college, he has to beg her to have a normal human but she desires nothing more than to give it all up. she fears marrying edward, but is dying to give up her soul to be a vampire; she at one point rationalizes that if she were a vampire, edward would never want to leave her again...does that make any sense? her value relies on rather or not a man- a vampire wants her, a horrible self-esteem lesson for every young girl, in a world where you hear of the abuse against women almost daily! a woman fought to be present, while books such as these teach young adult woman, a man is the beginning and ending of existence. i know it's a fantasy book, but books are meant as educational tools in one way or another. in harry potter the message is persistence, faith and overcoming, in wuthering heights it's a lesson on karma, and to do unto others etc...meyers gave her characters a happy ending they didn't deserve--and if they did deserve it, it's never explained why they did. she uses four pages, every time she mentions edwards's name to explain his beauty, but practically never explains why he'd crave human love. simply because he's a vampire isn't enough, because there are plenty of other vampires who get along fine, without love. is it because he's lonely? she doesn't explain it, but in a way that's too bad too, if he were truly interested in bella's well being and enjoying what he missed out on--a life. his actions however clearly show that's not the case either, so what? is he just selfish? hardly the kind of character you'd want to have a happy ending.in the end she marries edward, coaxes him into sex, gets pregnant which according to meyers own outline should have been impossible. she's a young mom, who must hide the dramatic time from her own mother, who she professes to love so very much. she has the kid, and accepts and expects jacob to protect it, but then gets angry when he does so the best way he knows how. never mind the fact, that he is still in love with her, she's inconsiderate! she won't have him, but won't let him go either! and finally bella and edward live happily ever after!it's a sick, sick series! you wouldn't know it by the first book, you'd believe it's a coming of age thing, that bella will mature, and that you will see her relationship with edward and jacob actually gain some substance. through the series, you're never given any actual reason for the love, not between ed and bella or between jake and bella. with edward especially is seems more like lust or some kind of spell, because all she can ever talk about his how handsome, beautifully angelic he is and how his smell makes her forget her thoughts, how his breath lulls her to sleep-- total nonsense.i know a love story is dramatic, heart wrenching, and usually someone gets jilted, but she takes it to a mental level. it should have some practical basis, or some redeeming qualities. it should make you believe in it, or admire something about it. in the case of the meyers series, all she gives you is a self-centered teenage girl who is incapable of not only taking care of herself, but bella can't even spare others her destruction because she chooses not to. it also sends the message that all little girls need in life, is a man and a baby, and i've wondered if that comes from meyer's mormon upbringing? i do not mean to insult any religion, and i do not know anything about meyers other than what i've read, but this series she's created is truly horrific. it exemplifies some sort of misogynistic idea; women, bella is clearly the weaker, albeit more manipulative sex.spare yourself the trouble, read something else. i usually don't write reviews but this series was so idiotic that i had to say something. i know it's just a book and i know it's a fantasy, but just as we try to hold tv and music responsible for the messages, they send to the youth we must do the same with what our children read. it's problem enough to talk about losing your soul, it's another to happily give it up, but when you add in destructiveness, selfishness, mental illness in the form of self-esteem issues, you have a serious problem that doesn't need to be shared.","i really like twilight (never a good a any of the hps, but it wa a good book), but after new moon i know i would hate the rest of the series-- and i do! i hope meyers would fix all the problem in her storyline, but it seem her mind- at least in write this series be a weak and flaw a her characters! i suppose it all wa just a weak rip off of wuthering height and romeo and juliet, but it lack enough back-story to allow the reader to understand why so many of the character be so pathetic, especially the main character, isabella. you'll end up not like her more so than sympathize with her, and her man, edward go from be the sharp, keen type, to a pillar to hold up the asinine bella.**series recap**bella be totally pathetic, she's a weak, selfish, flimsy woman. she fall for the vampire who try to no avail to convince her life be worth living. he leaf her to protect her, but she will only allow herself to believe he leave because she be so worthless! (which, a the series go on, you may believe she is.) through the series bella lament time and time again, how unworthy she is, and constantly ha some man to remind her of her importance! if you have a daughter with any kind of self-esteem issue please keep these book away from her!! bella us the young and innocent native american (jacob) a a crutch to survive her depression. she know he love her but won't deny herself the relief she get from presence even though she know she her only love be the vampire (edward).jacob risk his life time and time again to protect her, he's call to duty in the first place because of her relationship with edward. despite all jacob give to bella a soon a edward need her she toss jacob to the side to rescue edward. when edward vow to never leave her again, she more or le forget jacob, there be some extenuate circumstance but still she doe not put up the fight for him that she put up to have edward in her life. she disrespect her father, lie to her mother, and doe all the thing that would break any parent's heart to be with the vampire, and no matter how much she'll think of her poor parents, they're always some kind of afterthought. granted, in the first book she try to save her mom, but you'll soon see, if confront with the idea of leave edward to spare them, she'll leave them to have edward.bella refuse to accept that she cannot have both edward and jacob a they be mortal enemies, she's determine to have thing her way and actually feel like jacob be wrong for not give her what she wants, which be to be her best friend while she love the vampire...to make matter worse jacob's people have always exist to protect mankind, while edward be just an oddity who no-longer try to destroy humanity. through the series bella cause trouble time and time again, but be always rescued. she never develop any self-esteem or any ability to take care of herself. at one point, she actually risk her life just to have delusion of edward. she doesn't care about how her parents, or jacob, who she us to help induce these hallucinations, would feel if she died. she doesn't even care that she could be risk jacob's life too! she abandon her friend and her family to be with edward, who never really request that of her. edward ha to fight with her to attend college, he ha to beg her to have a normal human but she desire nothing more than to give it all up. she fear marry edward, but be die to give up her soul to be a vampire; she at one point rationalize that if she be a vampire, edward would never want to leave her again...does that make any sense? her value rely on rather or not a man- a vampire want her, a horrible self-esteem lesson for every young girl, in a world where you hear of the abuse against woman almost daily! a woman fight to be present, while book such a these teach young adult woman, a man be the begin and end of existence. i know it's a fantasy book, but book be mean a educational tool in one way or another. in harry potter the message be persistence, faith and overcoming, in wuthering height it's a lesson on karma, and to do unto others etc...meyers give her character a happy end they didn't deserve--and if they do deserve it, it's never explain why they did. she us four pages, every time she mention edwards's name to explain his beauty, but practically never explain why he'd crave human love. simply because he's a vampire isn't enough, because there be plenty of other vampire who get along fine, without love. be it because he's lonely? she doesn't explain it, but in a way that's too bad too, if he be truly interest in bella's well be and enjoy what he miss out on--a life. his action however clearly show that's not the case either, so what?

0,"first--i am new to the twilight saga, and i've decided to review these books in order, as i read them.second--i'll admit i genuinely enjoyed the first book, twilight, despite its flaws (which one only has to peruse the numerous 1-star reviews for to get a sense of what those flaws are). i gave it a fair 3-star review, just for the sheer fun i had reading it.so why am i giving new moon only 2 stars?1) i realize i'm not the first to point out that stephanie meyer's first-person style of writing often reads like a glorified fan fiction.  indeed, i have read numerous fan fictions that invoke many of the same characteristics that seem to be ubiquitous in meyer's writing: inane details, unimaginative surroundings, lengthy paragraphs describing feelings and emotions, too-convenient circumstances, and ridiculous plot devices--all told from a very ""mary sue"" type of perspective. however, i was hoping meyer had gotten most of these things out of her system in twilight, but they regrettably return in new moon, to an even more laughable degree.2) the story in this book really let me down. without giving too much away: we finally get to see bella on her own, left to her own devices, making her own choices. and i kept waiting for her to get angry at her situation; to finally grow a spine and be the independent girl i was hoping she'd be. but it never happened.  i thought edward's decision in the beginning would take this series an in an entirely new direction; allowing bella to flourish in her freedom and pursue her new found desires. instead we get chapter after chapter of suicidal thoughts, reckless behavior, using people, lying, and hallucinations, all for the sake of someone who, in my opinion, does not deserve her affections. it felt utterly pathetic to watch this unfold. 3) by the end of the book, i had the nagging feeling that this series has already long since ""jumped the shark"" and that new moon was just twilight's extended denouement. i enjoyed jacob's story (even though its emergence could not have possibly been more predictable) but couldn't help but feel that it was all filler. i was almost certain all the involvement with jacob was going to build up to and play a major role in this book's climax, but no. instead we get an angsty and entirely self-inflicted pointless conflict so ridiculous that it almost seems like meyer went out of her way to allow it to happen. and just as ridiculously, it was all swept under the rug and forgiven with very little action or consequences.so why did i read new moon? and why do i plan to read the next 2 books?  why do i have an infuriating desire to want to like these books?  the correct answer, i suspect, is a carefully-mixed cocktail of brilliant marketing, movie hype, and a basic storyline that is specifically meant to appeal to readers of literature's lowest common denominator--trashy romance novels.  yet i will keep reading because, despite my complaints, i do care about the characters meyer has created, even if i don't care for the way she writes them; which seems to be without subtlety or any true depth.  there have been so many times in these first 2 books that the story has hinted at taking an interesting or unexpected turn, but instead continues along its predictable and unimaginative path. i sincerely hope that things will get better in the next 2 books.","first--i be new to the twilight saga, and i've decide to review these book in order, a i read them.second--i'll admit i genuinely enjoy the first book, twilight, despite it flaw (which one only ha to peruse the numerous 1-star review for to get a sense of what those flaw are). i give it a fair 3-star review, just for the sheer fun i have read it.so why be i give new moon only 2 stars?1) i realize i'm not the first to point out that stephanie meyer's first-person style of write often read like a glorify fan fiction. indeed, i have read numerous fan fiction that invoke many of the same characteristic that seem to be ubiquitous in meyer's writing: inane details, unimaginative surroundings, lengthy paragraph describe feel and emotions, too-convenient circumstances, and ridiculous plot devices--all tell from a very ""mary sue"" type of perspective. however, i wa hop meyer have get most of these thing out of her system in twilight, but they regrettably return in new moon, to an even more laughable degree.2) the story in this book really let me down. without give too much away: we finally get to see bella on her own, leave to her own devices, make her own choices. and i keep wait for her to get angry at her situation; to finally grow a spine and be the independent girl i wa hop she'd be. but it never happened. i think edward's decision in the begin would take this series an in an entirely new direction; allow bella to flourish in her freedom and pursue her new find desires. instead we get chapter after chapter of suicidal thoughts, reckless behavior, use people, lying, and hallucinations, all for the sake of someone who, in my opinion, doe not deserve her affections. it felt utterly pathetic to watch this unfold. 3) by the end of the book, i have the nag feel that this series ha already long since ""jumped the shark"" and that new moon wa just twilight's extend denouement. i enjoy jacob's story (even though it emergence could not have possibly be more predictable) but couldn't help but feel that it wa all filler. i wa almost certain all the involvement with jacob wa go to build up to and play a major role in this book's climax, but no. instead we get an angsty and entirely self-inflicted pointless conflict so ridiculous that it almost seem like meyer go out of her way to allow it to happen. and just a ridiculously, it wa all sweep under the rug and forgive with very little action or consequences.so why do i read new moon?

0,"i was excited at the chance to buy any dragon naturally speaking, and expected to buy version 9.  when i went looking, i found new release version 10...read some reviews, compared versions, etc for several days before purchasing.first, it took 8 days for it to arrive in the mail, too long.  read the manual 1 day 1st before even trying to intall software - the book is very skimpy and doesnt address troubleshooting, but then it doesnt even have the company's website listed on/in it...that should have been a sign.then ive been frustrated for 3 days trying to install this software.  nuance help files, faq, and especially the index are absolutely horrible.  and yes, they say they will charge you for any help, whether by phone or email, which is absolutely stupid after paying 190$ for the software in the first place.1st problem was the c++ runtime/reboot error, where repeated rebooting doesnt fix the problem.  the nuance knowledgebase had several possible fixes, including a zip download, none worked.  i found a forum elsewhere that said to just go to c:/program files folder and look for the new dragon folder to delete it (bcs install was created and started, but not finished, so you wont lose anything anyway), and sure enough that solved the problem.  rebooting and running dvd again then installed the c++ runtime that was needed.2nd problem then was trying to install the dragon naturally speaking.  it started installing, then some english cab file has an invalid digital signature, and instead of passing over it or using it anyway, it ""rolled back"" and wouldnt install any of the files.  at least this error had a code ""1330"", which nuance knowledgebase had listed, and their solution 1 (of 3) worked, which is that you have to copy the entire dvd to your harddrive desktop, then run the install from the desktop instead.  3rd, then even while doing this, it wouldnt copy one of the .ini files, so i just was able to skip it.  finally the software installed.  happy days, i thought.i then tried to run it.  a ""serious error"" occurs when trying to initialize and run.  no code numbers, no other info, and no clue as to what a ""serious error"" means or what to do about it.  arrrgghhh !the stupid nuance index was clueless for a bit, but finally on the index word ""initialization"", i found the tech response.  a cpu must be able to use sse2.  never heard of it, but wikipedia helped.  end result is that your cpu has to be built since 2006 to have sse2 capability.  there is no way to add sse2 instructions to any other types of cpu/chips.  so, altho i have an 1.8 gh amd processor, which is what is stated in the minimum requirements, my processor was built in 2003 and thus is incapable of ever running this software.++so, if you have an older-than-2006 cpu, or also if you have such a new cpu that it runs 64-bit, dont buy this software, you'll never get to use it.  this sse2 requirement should have been included in the cpu requirements both on amazon's site as well as on nuance's site so that you would check this stuff out before purchasing and returning software.  after finding this error, i did find another tech forum that addressed using dragon n s 10 and sse2 requirement that is kept a big secret by nuance, and they suggested too, that nuance should either put it on their website, or on their box, or in their manual, or in their knowledgebase, or somewhere.  i agree, as i wasted 3 days of time over something that i knew about my computer, had it just been listed somewhere as a requirement.but any company that charges for tech support for even the initial installing when you pay 200$ or more for the software, especially when they dont have a sufficient troubleshooting knowledgebase, is a company that i dont care to do business with.  i am returning this product, and i better get my f*&(*&#$g refund from these screwy people.","i wa excite at the chance to buy any dragon naturally speaking, and expect to buy version 9. when i go looking, i find new release version 10...read some reviews, compare versions, etc for several day before purchasing.first, it take 8 day for it to arrive in the mail, too long. read the manual 1 day 1st before even try to intall software -

0,"perhaps i just got a lemon, but i just spent 4 hours trying to get this thing working, with no success. i have set up several other linksys wireless routers as well as a dlink wireless router in the past, so it's not as if i don't know what i'm doing. but i just can't figure out what this thing's problem is.for one thing, the setup disc that was included with the router only works a small percentage of the time. most of the time, when i had my laptop plugged into the router via ethernet cable (as the setup program instructs you to do), when you get to step 4, which is ""plug the router's power cable into the electrical outlet"", the setup program will sit for five to ten minutes only to tell me that my ethernet cable is not properly connected. uhh, what? i eventually found out that if i re-run the setup program and/or reboot my laptop several times, it will get past that problem, only to get to another problem:i get to the point where the setup program asks me to input settings for ssid, router login/password, and security (i tried, wep and wpa, as well as unsecured). i do all that, and from that point forward, nothing will connect to the router via wireless connection. i tried my laptop, my ipod touch, and my blackberry, none of them were ever able to connect. ethernet connection works, but no wireless. i also noticed that the wireless indicator light on the router will mysteriously stop illuminating until i power cycle the router. perhaps this is part of the problem. windows suggests it's a weak wireless signal, but i'm never more than ten feet away from the router.but wait, there's more. once i get the network set up via the setup disc, i can no longer access the router config page (192.168.1.1) from my browser. i can access it before i run the setup, but not after. it prompts me for my name and password, i enter them and hit enter, and it simply brings up the login window again, as if i typo'd. i tried the default login here, but that didn't work either. so again i have to reset the router with the reset button on the back.after 4 hours wasted on trying to get this piece of crap working, i gave up. there is no way in hell i should be running into this many problems. like i said, i have setup several wireless networks in the past, most of them linksys, and one dlink. they were all very painless, none of them took me anymore than 1/2 hour to set up a secured network from scratch. so this piece of crap is getting exchanged for either a linksys wrt54g or a dlink (can't recall the model number offhand), both are g routers that i recently setup for relatives, and i was able to get my laptop, ipod touch and blackberry connected to them without a single issue.update: i was able to get the router working for about half an hour, by simply moving it to where it was approximately five feet away from my laptop rather than ten feet. only thing i can figure is something where i had originally placed it was interfering with the signal. however, after half an hour, i suddenly lost net connection, and the router disappeared from the list of wireless devices, so i was unable to reconnect to it. all the lights were illuminated on the router, yet it just disappeared to where neither my laptop, ipod touch, or my friend's iphone could no longer see it. that's the final straw. this piece of junk is getting returned. horrible, horrible product.","perhaps i just get a lemon, but i just spend 4 hour try to get this thing working, with no success. i have set up several other linksys wireless router a well a a dlink wireless router in the past, so it's not a if i don't know what i'm doing. but i just can't figure out what this thing's problem is.for one thing, the setup disc that wa include with the router only work a small percentage of the time. most of the time, when i have my laptop plug into the router via ethernet cable (as the setup program instruct you to do), when you get to step 4, which be ""plug the router's power cable into the electrical outlet"", the setup program will sit for five to ten minute only to tell me that my ethernet cable be not properly connected. uhh, what?

1,"this review is from: wall-e (widescreen single-disc edition) (dvd)      my favorite disney pixar movie of all time is toy story and now i can say that it is wall*e. if you enjoy the pixar movies, you will love this movie. even if you aren't a fan of animation, i whole heartily recommend you go see wall*e. as an adult i was taught a lesson. when a child and adult can leave a movie together and talk about the same things they watched and ask questions, that is really an amazing thing.synopsis: what if mankind had to leave earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? after hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, wall*e (short for waste allocation load lifter earth-class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named eve. eve comes to realize that wall*e has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). meanwhile, wall*e chases eve across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion. joining wall*e on his journey across the universe is a cast of characters including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.the first few minutes of wall*e are a bit depressing. earth is a vast wasteland of garbage. and when i say wasteland, i mean that in the literal sense. humans have left earth because of the output of garbage, waste and abuse to the environment. the year is 2775 and all that remains are skyscrapers, filth and waste. as i sat there, the six year turns to me and asks what has happened to the earth? why all the garbage? i honestly have no answer for him and as he turns back to look at the screen he says, garbage is very bad. things become a bit lighter as we see wall*e on the screen. the character of wall*e is so very much like a child. he sees things as a child would. even though his job is to clean up the garbage the best he can, he likes to collect things such as rubik cubes, light bulbs and utensils. wall*e has such an incredible personality that shows he is not just a mindless robot. he enjoys watching an old time 1950's musical and loves the music and the dancing. he especially enjoys watching one scene over and over again where a man and woman are holding hands and sing to each other. wall*e assumes love means holding hands; but he has no one to hold hands with.eve comes down to earth with a directive in mind. she reminded me of a mutant egg, but quickly just as wall*e tugged at my heart, eve will do the same with you. wall*e welcomes her with open arms, so very happy he has another to share his toys with. he assumes she will want to stay with him and perhaps she will be the one to finally hold his hand. (the hand holding becomes very important throughout the movie) but wall*e has in his possession what eve is searching for. wall*e has found a small plant growing out of all the waste and gives it to eve. by plant life beginning to grown on earth again after hundreds of years, that means humans can return to their home and begin a new.eve is taken back to her ship and wall*e follows her because he thinks she is in danger. eve is sent back to a huge giant like cruise spaceship where humans live as if they are on permanent vacation. another disturbing fact is that because robots do everything for humans, humans have become big lazy blobs who ride around in chairs as they drink fatting shakes and watching tv very oblivious to life around them. when the captain of the ship receives the plant, it means they can return home to earth. but his co-pilot, which is a robot and so very much like hal from the movie 2001: a space odyssey has specific instructions that humans can not return to earth. it takes over the ship's controls and tries to stop wall*e and eve from placing the plant in a certain part of the ship that will enable them to go back to earth.so many lessons were taught and learned in this simple animated movie. it is heartbreaking to think in hundreds of years, earth may no longer be inhabitable by living things and we would have to leave to travel in space with no meaning. wall*e in some ways is very much like 2001: a space odyssey and as an adult i laughed at so many hidden jokes that came straight from the movie. but like 2001, there is hope and in wall*e even though things look hopeless, that is not the case. even though earth is devastated, things can change. by the end of wall*e my depression that i felt at the beginning of the movie became a feeling of hope. you must stay till the very end and watch the closing credits because as peter gabriel sings, we see through very amateur drawings how humans can make earth so very green again because of a robot who should have no feelings or personality was able to deliver one small plant that will become the roots for a future of hope.katiebabs","this review be from: wall-e (widescreen single-disc edition) (dvd) my favorite disney pixar movie of all time be toy story and now i can say that it be wall*e. if you enjoy the pixar movies, you will love this movie. even if you aren't a fan of animation, i whole heartily recommend you go see wall*e. a an adult i wa teach a lesson. when a child and adult can leave a movie together and talk about the same thing they watch and ask questions, that be really an amaze thing.synopsis: what if mankind have to leave earth, and somebody forget to turn the last robot off? after hundred of lonely year of do what he wa build for, wall*e (short for waste allocation load lifter earth-class) discover a new purpose in life (besides collect knick-knacks) when he meet a sleek search robot name eve. eve come to realize that wall*e ha inadvertently stumble upon the key to the planet's future, and race back to space to report her find to the human (who have be eagerly await word that it be safe to return home). meanwhile, wall*e chase eve across the galaxy and set an adventure into motion. join wall*e on his journey across the universe be a cast of character include a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunction misfit robots.the first few minute of wall*e be a bite depressing. earth be a vast wasteland of garbage. and when i say wasteland, i mean that in the literal sense. human have leave earth because of the output of garbage, waste and abuse to the environment. the year be 2775 and all that remain be skyscrapers, filth and waste. a i sit there, the six year turn to me and ask what ha happen to the earth? why all the garbage? i honestly have no answer for him and a he turn back to look at the screen he says, garbage be very bad. thing become a bite lighter a we see wall*e on the screen. the character of wall*e be so very much like a child. he see thing a a child would. even though his job be to clean up the garbage the best he can, he like to collect thing such a rubik cubes, light bulb and utensils. wall*e ha such an incredible personality that show he be not just a mindless robot. he enjoy watch an old time 1950's musical and love the music and the dancing. he especially enjoy watch one scene over and over again where a man and woman be hold hand and sing to each other. wall*e assume love mean hold hands; but he ha no one to hold hand with.eve come down to earth with a directive in mind. she remind me of a mutant egg, but quickly just a wall*e tug at my heart, eve will do the same with you. wall*e welcome her with open arms, so very happy he ha another to share his toy with. he assume she will want to stay with him and perhaps she will be the one to finally hold his hand.

1,"the 80's were particularly bad for disney. after sailing to the massive heights of cinderella, bambi, snow white and sleeping beauty, disney was now making films such as black cauldron, oliver & company and great mouse detective which didn't do the greatest of business. so little mermaid comes out and while box-office wise not as massive as lion king or aladdin, put the company back on track again. i wouldn't call it disney's best but it's certainly highly enjoyable, surprisingly affecting and a better movie than you'd think.taking place in the ocean's depths, ariel is a 16 year old mermaid who's fascinated by the surface world. her father, king triton, forbids any contact and is especially mad when ariel falls for a prince named eric. wanting to be with him, ariel strikes a deal with sea witch ursula: get eric to give her true love kiss and she'll remain a human forever, or she'll belong to ursula. with the help of friends sebastian, flounder and scuttle, ariel has to break the spell in 3 days.what's incredibly surprising about little mermaid is that there's very little pacing problems. unlike let's say, hercules or hunchback of notre dame which, while good, had a couple slow parts, there's rarely a scene that just feels long. if it's not the story that's catching you, it's a catchy song and the movie's full of them. to the emotional part of your world to the renowned under the sea the film has uplifting music that even you'll get in your head. and when you have frogs singing verses on kiss the girl, that's charming and a great song.one thing that surprised me about the transfer was while brighter than the old releases, it didn't have that lush colorful feel like lion king or beauty and the beast. does the film have any problems? um, well couple of the animation scenes are spotty, including backgrounds that look too painted and shifting character designs. one minute, ariel is beautiful and stunning than she'll have this weird look to her where she looks off-kilter to other scenes. and even though he redeems himself, king triton is arguably the worst father i've seen in a disney film, instead of being overprotective, he comes across as almost militant-like.since this is going back into the dreaded ""vault"" i'd suggest getting this quick. it's a great film, not only for kids but just for casual viewing. by the way, i believe the next ones are either peter pan, 101 dalmations and jungle book.","the 80's be particularly bad for disney. after sail to the massive height of cinderella, bambi, snow white and sleep beauty, disney wa now make film such a black cauldron, oliver & company and great mouse detective which didn't do the greatest of business. so little mermaid come out and while box-office wise not a massive a lion king or aladdin, put the company back on track again. i wouldn't call it disney's best but it's certainly highly enjoyable, surprisingly affect and a better movie than you'd think.taking place in the ocean's depths, ariel be a 16 year old mermaid who's fascinate by the surface world. her father, king triton, forbid any contact and be especially mad when ariel fall for a prince name eric. want to be with him, ariel strike a deal with sea witch ursula: get eric to give her true love kiss and she'll remain a human forever, or she'll belong to ursula. with the help of friend sebastian, flounder and scuttle, ariel ha to break the spell in 3 days.what's incredibly surprise about little mermaid be that there's very little pace problems. unlike let's say, hercules or hunchback of notre dame which, while good, have a couple slow parts, there's rarely a scene that just feel long. if it's not the story that's catch you, it's a catchy song and the movie's full of them. to the emotional part of your world to the renowned under the sea the film ha uplift music that even you'll get in your head. and when you have frog sing verse on kiss the girl, that's charm and a great song.one thing that surprise me about the transfer wa while brighter than the old releases, it didn't have that lush colorful feel like lion king or beauty and the beast. doe the film have any problems?

1,"i languished over the reviews of the currently available mini's and after reading all i could find the playing field was pretty much the same. atom 1.6 processor except hp but they were ruled out early for price bloat. i won't spend $700.00+ for a umpc, to me that defeats the purpose. to me a ultra portable is used as a supplement to a full fledged laptop not to replace it. so after studying the contestants i made my criteria for selection. the o.s. had to be windows xp for its combination of low system demands and its compatibility with everyday programs such as word. next i decided that it needed a traditional hard drive not the more expensive low capacity flash derivatives that aren't discernibly faster. third was battery life and last but seemingly more important was the aesthetics. i wanted it to look cool because i knew it would draw attention amongst my co-workers. i came down to the msi wind and the acer one. i am a big fan of the glossy screen technology and of a exterior that has the bling appeal. the msi has the matte screen and a matte exterior, boring!so the acer won or should i say one. but only in the 160 gig 6 cell battery version. it's not that anyone would need the 160 gig drive but that is how the win.xp, 6 cell battery version comes packaged which is ok by me. the bling is spot on! the exterior is a deep metallic blue...and is just outstanding to look at. yeah you'll leave finger prints like all the reviewers noted but guess what i just used a old, (but clean) sock and wala!! wiped them off in ohh maybe 5 seconds!! christ these reviewers are wimpy. it boots into xp faster than any desktop i've owned, repaired or built, < than 30 seconds. the six cell battery sticks out from the rear of the case but does not make it look odd and the extended battery life is worth it! five hours on a charge, thats unheard of with traditional laptops. it acquires my wireless access very quickly and surfs with all the speed my router pushes out. i didn't bother getting an external c/d drive to install any programs that i had on c/d. i just plugged in my 4 gig usb drive into my desktop machine and copied the installation c/d i needed onto it. then plugged the usb thumb drive into my acer one and double clicked the installation .exe and away it went. it also has a built in web cam wich is pretty cool. works fine but of course it's not your 30 frame a second hand held, but its fine for getting freaky with your g/f if shes off on a business trip.probably the best function with this is to get a wireless plan through your cell provider so you can connect anywhere your phone has service but there plans are so dam expensive!i really like this mini, it's well worth the $399 price tag. thats what amazon sells them for when they have them in stock, crazy sweet deal. don't pay the extra $100 that places like tiger have jacked it up to, just wait amazon will get more. newegg will treat you right as well.if your in the market for a mini, the acer aspire one will not disappoint!!

1,"having watched this movie on a plane ride, my first impression was that i really liked the movie. my second impression is that it would look nice in hd. thankfully marvel studios and paramount have delivered a great blu ray release w/ hd video.so the way the movie itself goes is typical super hero movie type stuff. if you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on. you won't like this movie anymore than you did the other super hero movies out there.tony stark, the sort of spoiled, super intelligent and conceited owner of stark enterprises finds himself in an impossible situation. while traveling through iraq to show off his great new weapons the humvee he is in is attacked and he is captured. he awakens to find that one of his captors has installed an electro magnet in his chest to prevent mobile shrapnel from the explosion tony was caught in from reaching his heart.in captivity he's asked to build one of his top of the line missiles for his captors, a jericho missile. instead he builds a prototype iron man suit and escapes. the experience changes his life and has him attempt to change his company and the world from the destruction he and has company have profited from.action, betrayal, small amount of clumsy love and that is iron man in a nut shell.the video is presented via the avc codec and looks amazing. the only areas of ""problem"" would be in the cave scenes. you can tell when the film stock changes or perhaps, if it was filmed in digital, grain was added to the video. the areas most affected are darker scenes and scenes where there is interaction between the prototype iron man suit (done in cg) and his environment and the terrorists. it's either an artistic decision or a choice to make the cg interaction less perceptible. it doesn't take away from the scenes and it doesn't detract from the movie.the audio is done in dolby true-hd and sounds fantastic. lows are low and highs are high. no clipping, no distortion and great separation of channels over all.having bought quite a few blu ray discs, i'm painfully aware of the lack of hd extras. not so with iron man. this release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries. and yes, the documentaries are all in hd. this may be the first blu ray disc i've purchased with all hd extras.also included is a bd live connection. i have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing. not sure about the bd live extras.so if you're looking for a super hero movie with some amazing video, amazing audio and amazing extras, look no further than iron man on blu ray.for those experiencing long load times:if you have a bd live capable player, in the menus of your player, turn off ""auto download"" and set it to confirm (or something along those lines). the reason the movie takes ""forever"" to start when you first insert it is because the quiz portion from bd-live needs to be downloaded and installed on your player. just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.and once it is installed the first time, assuming you wait, you won't see it again unless you get a new player and want to watch the movie.","have watch this movie on a

1,"i have the magic bullet and i read some less than good reviews on the unit. i would like to put those to rest if i may. 1. after using the magic bullet, could smell the motor burning up.   having worked with motors in the past, i can put that bad rap to rest. there are two types of electrical motors commonly used in the market today. one is an induction motor. and the other is the brush and commentator motor. although the induction motor is most commonly used, there are some brush types out there. the burning electrical smell you sensed is common, especially when first using the motor. when first used, the brushes are not worn slightly to perfectly fit against the commentator. until that happens, the brushes will slightly arc and you will sense an electrical smell but it doesn't take long till they are perfectly fitted to the commentator. after that, the smell will no longer be there. this is normal and is not a problem. it is not a sign of overheating or any damage to the motor.   2. i found an excellent quick way to clean the bullet. i first spray the blade and inside of the cup to remove larger particles, then i fill the cup about 1/3 full with water and just a drop of soap detergent. screw the blade lid on firmly and pulse it a few times. unscrew and rinse and you will have a sparkling clean unit. this will get into areas that otherwise you couldn't possibly reach especially in and around the blade area.  3. i have also found that removing the processed food from the cup is best done with a small rubber spatula as use of a metal object like a knife or fork etc will eventually scratch and mar the plastic. 4. my magic bullet came with several replacement rubber gaskets that are used inside the black blade screw on caps. when you have cleaned your unit and you are going to store with blade cap screwed onto the food cup, do not screw the blade cap tightly with the food cup as when it is stored even overnite, the rubber gasket will tend to flatten out and then need replacement.i always leave mine about a turn loose and you will get a lot more use out the gaskets.5. when i am making a sandwich spread or anything requiring mayo i wait until i have finished processing the food and then i mix the processed food and mayo in a separate bowl. if you add the mayo before processing, the mayo and the fool is going to stick to the sides and even tapping is not going to loosen it. 6. the instruction book says that you need to occasionally tap the blade/cup unit to free up food to get to the blade. i have personally found that a back and forth shaking motion does a much better job as all the food in usually at the bottom anyway and a few shakes will move it into the blades and wa-la, it works mucho bettro. 7. if you read the instructions and use accordingly, you will find the magic bullet works, (maybe not excatly like on tv) but i am very pleased with mine. i have also fould that the shorter   pulses seem to work best as they don't tend to sling the food out and away from the blade. 8. i tried processing some pecans, mixed a little soy milk and honey and created some great tasting health food.if you are considering the magic bullet, i can just say that it is like anything else, when directions are followed, it will work fine. when i picked up the base unit, the weight tells me that the motor is plenty big enough

1,"i should provide a disclaimer:  i'm a windows convert, though i used macs intermittently over the past 14 years; i wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new macbooks came out and i realized that os x existed.  therefore, this review doesn't compare the new mbp with the more recent older mac machines.  i'm mostly just comparing my new mbp to the long string of windows machines i've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the dell latitude d610 laptop. that said, it's been a month since i received my new mbp from amazon, and i absolutely love it.keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  very good size.trackpad:  generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  it was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  a month later, i almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and i love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if i, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  i have the bottom right corner designated as ""right-click,"" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  this doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  even given that, though, i love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any pc trackpad.chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  you can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an apple store.  i'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.screen:  lots of people hate it.  i don't!  i work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and i took it to my office once, but i have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet i will).  yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  i can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  i think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments i have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments i described.  (one note, though it's already been said:  the regular mb does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an apple store, i could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)os:  i really love the new mac os.  it's so seamless, so intuitive, and i love how all the programs work together.  it's not as if i need an os this user-friendly, either; i was technically savvy enough to understand windows pretty well, and i use linux at work.  but it's just so nice to come home to an os that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  also, with mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  granted, i'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the gimp), and things like that.  i also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant lucida grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my gui.performance:  i have not had a single crash yet.  i think something slowed things down once, and i restarted.  once.  in a month.  and it was probably my fault.  the system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my dell (2.13 ghz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my mac (2.4 ghz) ""about a minute"" to copy.  airport wireless worked easily the minute i took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  my mbp runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), dvds run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.i can't recommend getting a mac enough, especially a mbp if you have the extra cash.  it's arguable whether i really did, but for better or worse, i'm glad i shelled out.  i bought my mac and applecare through amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.","i should provide a disclaimer: i'm a window convert, though i use mac intermittently over the past 14 years; i wasn't pay attention to how cool they'd get until the new macbooks come out and i realize that o x existed. therefore, this review doesn't compare the new mbp with the more recent older mac machines. i'm mostly just compare my new mbp to the long string of window machine i've owned, the most recent one be a beefy version of the dell latitude d610 laptop. that said, it's be a month since i receive my new mbp from amazon, and i absolutely love it.keyboard: very comfortable and quiet; limit space to get crumb stick beneath the keys. very good size.trackpad: generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glow review be that a others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes. it wa definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happen - it get better with use. a month later, i almost prefer use the trackpad to a regular mouse because of it multitouch function that make scroll and navigate such a breeze, and i love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if i, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere. sometimes even physically click the pad won't register appropriately. i have the bottom right corner designate a ""right-click,"" but sometimes area other than that one will register a right-clicks, too. this doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritate that it happen at all. even give that, though, i love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any pc trackpad.chassis: so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful. you can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an apple store. i'll be heed others' comment here about how thin the metal be around some of the ports, though.screen: lot of people hate it. i don't! i work with my computer in a variety of different light set around my home and i take it to my office once, but i have not use it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet i will). yes, sometimes there be glare, but guess what? i can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it. i think the quality and beauty of the screen be more than worth these tiny adjustment i have to make to compensate for it reflectiveness. some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that come with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kind of adjustment i described.

0,"in this book, you find bella & edward reunited. a well-deserved reunion for everything they went through in book 2. but the thrill quickly wears off as bella turns inward in angst about  her feelings for jacob. it got a little tiresome as she complained yet again why jacob and edward can't ""just play nice"". when the answer should be obvious! bella's not dumb. so i was disappointed when it took her most of the book to figure it out. the book would have been more interesting written partially from edward's perspective - his need to make it up to bella for abandoning her in new moon and his jealousy towards jacob as he attempts again and again to move in on his girlfriend. but the biggest flaw of this book was the lack of plot. we know that victoria is out there somewhere plotting her death, but that aspect of it was so overshadowed by bella's mundane angst that left me wondering if victoria gave up. she came through in the end, but underwhelmingly. her schemes were predictable from the first quarter of the book and so was her ending. also, the moral preachiness of no sex before marriage theme was more than irritating. this is a vampire fiction novel. not a church sermon! i found it hard to believe that edward would have held on to that trite human thinking when he's lived as a modern, all powerful vampire for the last 100 years. quaint and silly human notions of morality would be the last thing he would be concerned about, i would think. concerns for her safety would be the only thing on his mind, not some out-dated, narrow notion of right and wrong. but this book does have some redeeming qualities. i enjoyed the back-stories of rosalie, jasper and sam. it pumped the much needed life into this book. also, edward's sacrafices for her throughout this book was really touching. i'm sure he did not enjoy watching his girlfriend sleep in someone else's arms as jacob attempts to thaw her from hypothermia. we only got an inkling of edward's displeasure at this, when it should have been a raging inferno worthy of 1000 suns! held in check only by his wish to see bella happy. this book's okay. i'll still read book 4 after this. but i thought it could have been better.","in this book, you find bella & edward reunited. a well-deserved reunion for everything they go through in book 2. but the thrill quickly wear off a bella turn inward in angst about her feel for jacob. it get a little tiresome a she complain yet again why jacob and edward can't ""just play nice"". when the answer should be obvious! bella's not dumb. so i wa disappoint when it take her most of the book to figure it out. the book would have be more interest write partially from edward's perspective - his need to make it up to bella for abandon her in new moon and his jealousy towards jacob a he attempt again and again to move in on his girlfriend. but the biggest flaw of this book wa the lack of plot. we know that victoria be out there somewhere plot her death, but that aspect of it wa so overshadow by bella's mundane angst that leave me wonder if victoria give up. she come through in the end, but underwhelmingly. her scheme be predictable from the first quarter of the book and so wa her ending. also, the moral preachiness of no sex before marriage theme wa more than irritating. this be a vampire fiction novel. not a church sermon! i find it hard to believe that edward would have hold on to that trite human think when he's live a a modern, all powerful vampire for the last 100 years. quaint and silly human notion of morality would be the last thing he would be concern about, i would think. concern for her safety would be the only thing on his mind, not some out-dated, narrow notion of right and wrong. but this book doe have some redeem qualities. i enjoy the back-stories of rosalie, jasper and sam. it pump the much need life into this book. also, edward's sacrafices for her throughout this book wa really touching. i'm sure he do not enjoy watch his girlfriend sleep in someone else's arm a jacob attempt to thaw her from hypothermia. we only get an inkling of edward's displeasure at this, when it should have be a rag inferno worthy of 1000 suns! hold in check only by his wish to see bella happy. this book's okay. i'll still read book 4 after this. but i think it could have be better.",boo united well deserved thin rough ill quickly a little tiresome complain plain just nice obvious partially abandon new jealousy lousy attempt big wonder able first novel find it hard to hard old trite modern powerful quaint silly safety mind out-dated narrow right wrong back much need really touching worthy wish to happy still

1,"""3 and a half stars, are you kidding me?""i know that's what's going through your mind, and probably rightfully so.  i mean, this movie has been lauded as one of the greatest of the decade.  and truthfully speaking, it is a good movie; better than some others i've been forced to endure.  but it's not ""great"".  that's what this review will tell you - why i say the movie isn't ""great"".background - i did watch, and quite enjoyed, batman begins.  if you haven't seen that movie, you don't need to in order to understand the events of dark knight, though some experiences are made better if you did (such as the relationship between wayne and rachel).  but what batman begins did right is the backstory; how batman got his training and expertise, as well as his morality and sense of justice.  also, his basic understanding of the criminal mind is briefly explained here, and his development of the various tools of the trade that he now uses to dole out the justice.  because of that, it's a good idea to watch batman begins first, even if not required, because it sets the stage nicely.  a friend of mine who is a dc comics fan couldn't stand batman begins, because, as he put it, ""batman isn't supposed to be that serious"".  maybe not from the comic book world, but the comic book world is designed to be lighthearted so it can be catered to kids.  when you translate that across to a more mature audience, you need to make the character that much more mature.  this is important, because the same methodology applies to dark knight, if not more so.without spoiling anything, the whole deal behind dark knight is that batman encounters a character who is his exact polar opposite: he's serious, yet treats things such as killing very lightly.  he has no code, no morals, no ethics...only a means to an end.  this is expressed throughout the movie, as the joker goes to any length to get what he wants.  during the movie this is believed to be a simple crime, but it eventually turns out to be a total twist - proving a point to batman and in the doing, making batman violate some of his moral code in order to stop him.  all of this is done very well; in fact, it's clear that the very happy-happy ending of batman begins was not appealing to someone in the writer's office, because this one never gets happy-happy.  some of it is downright depressing, which i suppose is the intent of the movie.what the movie does right: christian bale does a good job of playing bruce wayne and batman respectively.  bruce wayne is not involved in this movie nearly as much as the first one and in fact, feels like an afterthought.  there's a lot more focus on batman this time around, which is as it should be.  heath ledger, who i doubt you've not heard about, plays the joker extremely well.  what some people claim is an inaccurate portrayal, again, is simply a rendition of the comic book character changed to a more mature setting, and it comes across well.  joker knows exactly what he's doing, but just does not feel remorse for any of it.  he doesn't stick himself into a funnel with some moral code; he does what needs to be done, and understands that in order to stop him, everyone, even the most ethical, would do the same thing when pushed to that limit.  aaron eckhart, who some might recognize from ""the core"", enters into the story as harvey dent, a prosecutor who relies on chance (evident by dent's frequent flipping of a two-headed coin) to get through his profession.  all of the other actors play their parts decently well, but ledger stands out above the rest, followed shortly by (in my opinion) bale, and then eckhart.  i know christopher nolan would have you believe that eckhart is the shining star, but his performance was marred by a part that effectively was not done properly (more on that in the next section).what the movie does wrong: it's all subjective, but there was quite a bit i didn't care for.  first, batman begins did a great job at telling a story that was easy to follow along with.  dark knight attempted to continue this story by introducing a darker side of gotham, but in the process did way too much in too short a time.  i don't like when movies attempt to rush what they're doing, or throw too much into the 2 hour slot, and that's exactly what dark knight did.  in effect, it was two different movies overlapping one another.  first, there was the joker storyline - the center of the movie.  this was done well for the most part.  then, you had the two-face substory, which they treated as an offshoot of the joker storyline.  in the end it seemed like a good idea, but was horribly implemented - the two-face substory should have been a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between wayne and dent really is.  they had significantly more history than wayne and joker.  it ended up being about 20 minutes total of two-face action, which i found unacceptable, seeing the reason two-face even came into existence according to the movie.  the ending wasn't too great either.my next complaint had to do with scarecrow, played again by cillian murphy.  there was some association with joker which was never fully explained, but what really bothered me was the fact that it felt like he was just thrown in without any rhyme or reason.  first it seems like he's trying to help batman, then it seems like he's trying to help joker.  on top of all of this it's never explained how he got out of arkham asylum in the first place.  then he's just dismissed without a second glance.  made no sense to have him in the movie.finally, there were a lot of things going on that also were not fully explained or justified.  i can't say anything without spoiling, but suffice it to say, some characters died who didn't really die, some characters got arrested who weren't really arrested, some people get shot but not hurt, some people got stabbed but not hurt, some people just disappeared without a trace.  at the end of the day, some of the things just didn't make any sense.  like i said, it felt like they were trying to do too much at once instead of just breaking this apart into two movies - which i can tell they could have done and ended up with two pretty good movies instead of one good one.i still recommend the movie; but it's not for everyone.  those who were fans of the more story driven batman begins might be a little disappointed.  action and cgi junkies will fall over themselves on this movie; there's a lot going on at almost all times.","""3 and a half stars, be you kid me?""i know that's what's go through your mind, and probably rightfully so. i mean, this movie ha be laud a one of the greatest of the decade. and truthfully speaking, it be a good movie;

he doe what need to be done, and understand that in order to stop him, everyone, even the most ethical, would do the same thing when push to that limit. aaron eckhart, who some might recognize from ""the core"", enter into the story a harvey dent, a prosecutor who rely on chance (evident by dent's frequent flip of a two-headed coin) to get through his profession. all of the other actor play their part decently well, but ledger stand out above the rest, follow shortly by (in my opinion) bale, and then eckhart. i know christopher nolan would have you believe that eckhart be the shin star, but his performance wa mar by a part that effectively wa not do properly (more on that in the next section).what the movie doe wrong: it's all subjective, but there wa quite a bite i didn't care for. first, batman begin do a great job at tell a story that wa easy to follow along with. dark knight attempt to continue this story by introduce a darker side of gotham, but in the process do way too much in too short a time. i don't like when movie attempt to rush what they're doing, or throw too much into the 2 hour slot, and that's exactly what dark knight did. in effect, it wa two different movie overlap one another. first, there wa the joker storyline - the center of the movie. this wa do well for the most part. then, you have the two-face substory, which they treat a an offshoot of the joker storyline. in the end it seem like a good idea, but wa horribly implement - the two-face substory should have be a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between wayne and dent really is. they have significantly more history than wayne and joker. it end up be about 20 minute total of two-face action, which i find unacceptable, see the reason two-face even come into existence accord to the movie. the end wasn't too great either.my next complaint have to do with scarecrow, play again by cillian murphy. there wa some association with joker which wa never fully explained, but what really bother me wa the fact that it felt like he wa just throw in without any rhyme or reason. first it seem like he's try to help batman, then it seem like he's try to help joker. on top of all of this it's never explain how he get out of arkham asylum in the first place. then he's just dismiss without a second glance. make no sense to have him in the movie.finally, there be a lot of thing go on that also be not fully explain or justified. i can't say anything without spoiling, but suffice it to say, some character die who didn't really die, some character get arrest who weren't really arrested, some people get shoot but not hurt, some people get stab but not hurt, some people just disappear without a trace. at the end of the day, some of the thing just didn't make any sense. like i said, it felt like they be try to do too much at once instead of just break this apart into two movie - which i can tell they could have do and end up with two pretty good movie instead of one good one.i still recommend the movie; but it's not for everyone. those who be fan of the more story drive batman begin might be a little disappointed. action and cgi junky will fall over themselves on this movie; there's a lot go on at almost all times.",star rough your mind ably right mean laud great truthful ill back round need understand even dark ache expert just basic criminal briefly plain first require set nice serious boo lighthearted cross more much more mature important spoil thin whole exact very lightly want simple in fact clear happy downright depressing intent respect feel like like focus doubt extremely well inaccurate accurate simply change exactly feel remorse evident decent low effectively properly wrong subjective care for easy long attempt ace intricate real really significantly minute unacceptable accept able complaint bother miss finally justified pretty good good still commend a little disappointed

0,"customer review from the amazon vine™ program (what's this?)      an interesting little camera. it is small, about the size of a small remote control, has a fixed internal memory and recharges its internal battery only through a usb port.the video quality is okay, but not great. my canon a720 is shoots much better video, and more of it, depending on the memory card used. this camera is limited to only the internal memory, and records 60 minutes at 640x480, 30 fps in mpeg-4, (assuming the battery lasts). that should be pretty good video, depending on the flavor of mp-4 used (part 10 or h.264 is a very good codec, but it isn't stated that this uses h.264). the only place any such information is found is on the bottom of the box in very small print.the camera has software built in to copy video to a  computer (windows xp, vista, or mac os x only). manipulating it from there on is not well documented, and the software has to be loaded from the camera to your computer - not a good thing. there was very little documentation included, which is not acceptable for the price. granted, this is a video camera for people for people who don't want to be bothered learning any details about the gadgets they use, but a true gadget lover wants to know things that just aren't included.  their website is flash only, and the most recent edition of firefox couldn't load any useful information - another major strike against them.i found the camera easy to use, but extremely limited. it has to be recharged by usb port, so you can never get far from another device (most likely a computer) to recharge the camera. you cannot expand or swap the memory or change the video quality, so it is pretty much a niche camera for keeping around the office or home to point and shoot odd little bits of video here and there, or for short trips away from a usb charger.i can't see $180 for a camera with such limited capabilities. personally, i would much rather deal with the larger a720 is, and be able to shoot 8 megapixel stills as well as great video, have removable sd memory cards, and use aa size batteries, all for only $20 more. the difference in flexibility and usefulness for that $20 is pretty amazing, and casts a pretty big shadow over the flip. the small size is about the only strong point (if you happen to think smaller is better), but with the need for usb power and limited memory, it would not be a good camera to carry around even though it is small enough to fit easily into a shirt pocket.also, the build quality is not great. the camera looks great, but the pop-out usb jack is kind of flimsy and oriented so the weight of the whole camera hangs off at an angle. you will probably want a usb extension cable. it just doesn't seem very well thought out. the buttons and ""touch points"" that operate the camera are pretty sensitive, and are easily bumped by accident when the camera is on. it is not comfortable to hold, and the beefy metal tripod mount seems way out of place on a little camera like this.if your video shooting desires fit in with its limited functions, this camera might be useful, but it seems to me it is just an expensive, limited function toy. it comes in a very nice flip (aha!) top box with a soft cloth carry bag (all nicely coordinated by the marketing team). would that as much thought had gone into the design/use of the actual camera as was spent on the packaging/marketing concept.","customer review from the amazon vine™ program (what's this?) an interest little camera. it be small, about the size of a small remote control, ha a fix internal memory and recharge it internal battery only through a usb port.the video quality be okay, but not great. my canon a720 be shoot much better video, and more of it, depend on the memory card used. this camera be limit to only the internal memory, and record 60 minute at 640x480, 30 fps in mpeg-4, (assuming the battery lasts). that should be pretty good video, depend on the flavor of mp-4 use (part 10 or h.264 be a very good codec, but it isn't state that this us h.264). the only place any such information be find be on the bottom of the box in very small print.the camera ha software build in to copy video to a computer (windows xp, vista, or mac o x only). manipulate it from there on be not well documented, and the software ha to be load from the camera to your computer -

of the original show. i missed the first episode way back when (it aired the weekend i went away to college), and i never really caught back up. that, plus i harbored a grudge for what glenn larceny (as i remember author harlan ellison calling him) did to buck rogers. but ronald moore and co. have taken the concepts of the original and done an incredible job of thinking them through.the most obvious alteration is the human-appearing cylons. while this could be considered to be done out of budgetary concerns, it serves the purpose of increasing the dramatic tension as members of the galactica's fleet serve as cylon moles, sometimes against their wills. additionally, the political and spiritual connotations have been played up this time, at no expense to the action. and i would even go so far to suggest that the conflicts among the humans here, especially toward the end of the first season, are nearly as hard-fought as the battles with the cylons.one complaint about the series that possibly has some credence is that the show is relentlessly bleak. this is arguably true. i, for one, always watch the subtitle at the beginning of each episode that counts the number of human lives remaining on galactica and the other ships from the initial 50,000 (on the 8/5/05 episode, the count was down to 47,000 and change). while things could lighten up a little for the fleet, we need to consider that the fate of the human race is at stake here at all times. also, i have heard complaints that, among the racial/gender switch-ups done among the characters (i.e., starbuck/that guy from the a-team to starbuck/attitudinal blonde chick)that african-americans actors have taken a hit since boomer and tigh are now played as an asian woman and a drunken caucasian man, respectively. but the greater spectrum of races and sexes on display is encouraging. just give us a good black regular character soon!finally, if great effects, powerful writing, and good acting

1,"this review is from: the dark knight (two-disc special edition + digital copy) (dvd)      in ""batman begins,"" christopher nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.that moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing ""dark knight,"" which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered gotham city, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of nolan's batman movies to a work of cinematic art.bruce wayne/batman (christian bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against scarecrow and some batman impersonators.so unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new da harvey dent (aaron eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. but batman isn't prepared for the joker (heath ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the dark knight. he starts blackmailing batman by killing gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until batman turns himself in.but even when captured, the joker has an ace up his sleep -- dent and rachel dawes' (maggie gyllenhaal) lives. and after a devastating loss, batman finds himself dealing with the joker taking all of gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. only batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the dark knight forever.most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. but no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in ""the dark knight"" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. instead christopher nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as batman himself.and nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking batpod and the tanklike batmobile. the dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (""that isn't exactly what i had in mind when i said i wanted to inspire people"","" batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.this is especially true whenever the joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. and nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on batman. his direction is painfully delicate as he explores wayne's sorrow and guilt.but the most striking aspect of ""the dark knight"" is nolan's delvings into morality -- the joker has none and dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. it's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being too overwhelmingly dark.christian bale is simply perfection as bruce wayne/batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see wayne's soul bleeding. and he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.on the flipside, the late heath ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could. he's pretty spine-chilling, actually -- the joker is a true ""agent of chaos,"" whose intent is to seize gotham, and corrupt batman's soul along the way. there's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast -- eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding da whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and michael caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic alfred.the two-disc special edition isn't quite as special as i had hoped (deleted scenes?), but it has a serviceable bunch of extras anyway, including a digital copy of the selfsame movie, galleries for pictures, imax renderings of certain scenes, a bunch of mocked-up news programs from ""gotham tonight"" and a documentary about the making of the film. i smell double-dipping in this movie's future, especially since the blu-ray is reportedly far better endowed with extras.""the dark knight"" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece. utterly astounding -- and promises better yet to come.","this review be from:

0,"maybe i'm asking too much for a $250 product, but i feel a little misled.  in addition to the minidvd record capability it has a flash memory where you can take video and pictures too.  the product came out this year, so i thought i could use a couple larger flash memory cards and mainly record video that route.  once i get this, i learn it only takes 2gb cards (no sdhc).  so i buy 4 2gb cards and a 3pack of minidvds, figuring i'd just use flash memory and that would be easy enough for most of my recording.  the first time i put in an sd card and see that the screen switches from 16:9 to 4:3 on me.  i discover that it only records 4:3 on sd.  and i learn that it records in mpeg4 for sd memory (versus mpeg2 on the dvds).  i understand their mpeg4 has proprietary codecs, etc.  i tried importing video into sony vegas, but found it would not read the format off of the minidvd.  i tried re-ripping the dvd using dvd decrypter, but that still did not work as once i dragged the video file into vegas, i got only video (no audio).  also, in general i found the use of the minidvd's on this samsung to be not very attractive.  like many users, i pause when recording.  when viewing the recorded dvd, each pause at the end of a segment would show as a frozen image for 2-3 seconds before moving to the next scene, which is very annoying compared to using tapes to record to.  thanks to amazon's generous return policy, i'm not at a loss.  am seriously considering going the high def route, as it seems many of those products have less problems (based on reviews here) for someone like me who wants to be able to do some editing of the video i shoot.","maybe i'm ask too much for a $250 product, but i feel a little misled. in addition to the minidvd record capability it ha a flash memory where you can take video and picture too. the product come out this year, so i think i could use a couple larger flash memory card and mainly record video that route. once i get this, i learn it only take 2gb card (no sdhc). so i buy 4 2gb card and a 3pack of minidvds, figure i'd just use flash memory and that would be easy enough for most of my recording. the first time i put in an sd card and see that the screen switch from 16:9 to 4:3 on me. i discover that it only record 4:3 on sd. and i learn that it record in mpeg4 for sd memory (versus mpeg2 on the dvds). i understand their mpeg4 ha proprietary codecs, etc. i try import video into sony vegas, but find it would not read the format off of the minidvd. i try re-ripping the dvd use dvd decrypter, but that still do not work a once i drag the video file into vegas, i get only video (no audio). also, in general i find the use of the minidvd's on this samsung to be not very attractive. like many users, i pause when recording. when view the record dvd, each pause at the end of a segment would show a a freeze image for 2-3 second before move to the next scene, which be very annoy compare to use tape to record to. thank to amazon's generous return policy, i'm not at a loss. be seriously consider go the high def route, a it seem many of those product have le problem (based on review here) for someone like me who want to be able to do some edit of the video i shoot.",thin large mainly just easy first understand prop decry still ill general not very very attractive active like free thank generous icy seriously sly consider high base want to able

1,"next to the iphone, the ipod touch is one of the greatest handheld devices ever conceived. i wouldn't call this an mp3 or even an mp4 player, because it is so much more. the ipod touch combines a portable media player, a portable gaming device, a pda, a net-tablet/netbook, a voip phone, an internet radio, an ebook reader, and even a musical instrument in to one very thin, very beautiful, and very intuitive device.as a pmp, the ipod touch is fantastic. the built-in speaker might not be of audiophile quality, but it is one of my favourite features. i am now able to listen to music while doing things that wouldn't permit me to wear my headphones, and i don't need a docking station to do so. also, the new apple genius playlist compiler works very well, and i find myself using it all of the time. video quality is top notch as well. i definitely appreciate the ability to switch between the filled-screen and uncropped modes. the ipod touch handles skipping through long parts of video without lag, which is also impressive.as a gaming device, the ipod touch has really impressed me. the processor of the ipod touch 2g is far more powerful than the psp (though the graphics card isn't quite as good) and because the touch relies completely on its flash memory, games load in seconds compared to wasting half of your flight waiting for the dismal loading times on the psp. the graphics are far above expectations for an ipod, and can even rival some decent psp games. ipod touch games are also far cheaper than comparable psp and ds games. the biggest drawback is obviously the lack of buttons, but touch games overcome that with unique methods of game input (touch, motion, sound, etc). in my opinion, the ipod touch is like a cross between a psp, a ds, and a wii when it comes to gaming.additionally, the ipod touch is a good net-tablet. the internet loads quickly, and most sites work just as they would in the normal safari browser. i have yet to come in to problems with the lack of flash/java support, as many web developers create ipod/iphone versions of their sites to circumvent problem. i'm sure flash and java will be supported in future updates, so it's only a matter of time anyway. typing with the onscreen keyboard really isn't as bad as many are suggesting, and auto-correction can now be turned off if you don't like it (though i think it is brilliant).some nice pda features are pre-loaded on to the ipod touch, and you can download many more off of the app store for free. the calendar is one of the better mobile calendars i have used, and it is much better than the one that was first launched for ipod touch in 2007. by far though, my favourite pda app is mail. it works just like the mail app in mac os x, and it can read word docs, pdf files, excel spreadsheets, powerpoint shows, and all of the iwork equivalents. it checks your mail periodically and will alert you to new messages (you can adjust/turn off this feature). contacts can be entered as well, and you can add pictures for your contacts. i like how you can specify the country of the phone number by adding the country code, and it will automatically put the spaces in the correct places.other features on the latest ipod touch include the voip phone functionality (free 3rd party app required), though you'll need to purchase a compatible microphone. other free 3rd party apps add internet radio; pianos, guitars, flutes, and drums; and an ebook reader which is also capable of buying new books on the internet.i've had my ipod touch 2g for a while now, and i am still constantly impressed by its excellent functionality.and yes apple, it is the ""funnest"" ipod ever.","next to the iphone, the ipod touch be one of the greatest handheld device ever conceived. i wouldn't call this an mp3 or even an mp4 player, because it be so much more. the ipod touch combine a portable medium player, a portable game device, a pda, a net-tablet/netbook, a voip phone, an internet radio, an ebook reader, and even a musical instrument in to one very thin, very beautiful, and very intuitive device.as a pmp, the ipod touch be fantastic. the built-in speaker might not be of audiophile quality, but it be one of my favourite features. i be now able to listen to music while do thing that wouldn't permit me to wear my headphones, and i don't need a dock station to do so. also, the new apple genius playlist compiler work very well, and i find myself use it all of the time. video quality be top notch a well. i definitely appreciate the ability to switch between the filled-screen and uncropped modes. the ipod touch handle skip through long part of video without lag, which be also impressive.as a game device, the ipod touch ha really impress me. the processor of the ipod touch 2g be far more powerful than the psp (though the graphic card isn't quite a good) and because the touch rely completely on it flash memory, game load in second compare to waste half of your flight wait for the dismal load time on the psp. the graphic be far above expectation for an ipod, and can even rival some decent psp games. ipod touch game be also far cheaper than comparable psp and d games. the biggest drawback be obviously the lack of buttons, but touch game overcome that with unique method of game input (touch, motion, sound, etc). in my opinion, the ipod touch be like a cross between a psp, a ds, and a wii when it come to gaming.additionally, the ipod touch be a good net-tablet. the internet load quickly, and most site work just a they would in the normal safari browser. i have yet to come in to problem with the lack of flash/java support, a many web developer create ipod/iphone version of their site to circumvent problem. i'm sure flash and java will be support in future updates, so it's only a matter of time anyway. type with the onscreen keyboard really isn't a bad a many be suggesting, and auto-correction can now be turn off if you don't like it (though i think it be brilliant).some nice pda feature be pre-loaded on to the ipod touch, and you can download many more off of the app store for free. the calendar be one of the better mobile calendar i have used, and it be much better than the one that wa first launch for ipod touch in 2007. by far though, my favourite pda app be mail. it work just like the mail app in mac o x, and it can read word docs, pdf files, excel spreadsheets, powerpoint shows, and all of the iwork equivalents. it check your mail periodically and will alert you to new message (you can adjust/turn off this feature). contact can be enter a well, and you can add picture for your contacts. i like how you can specify the country of the phone number by add the country code, and it will automatically put the space in the correct places.other feature on the latest ipod touch include the voip phone functionality (free 3rd party app required), though you'll need to purchase a compatible microphone. other free 3rd party apps add internet radio;

0,"i think it is certainly worth buying if you already own the other three books. might as well finish the series. if you can get away with just borrowing the book, you'd probably feel a little better after reading it, knowing that you saved money.as a serious twilight series fan, i feel terrible for disliking this book, terrible for criticizing meyer, but i can't like the book no matter how much i try. twilight has had a long battle between those who prefer the relationship of jacob/bella (team jacob) and those who prefer edward/bella (team edward). breaking dawn was going to be the big bang, and we were all ready and waiting. however, after reading it, i can't help but think: team jacob never had a dying chance, and team jacob didn't even have a chance at a *decent* ending. team edward got what they wanted, but it seemed to happen tastelessly and all too perfectly. i have two words for you: convenient coincidences. this book solely thrives on convenient coincidences.the book certainly does have a few good points. the mystery of bella's half-breed child and bella's ""shielding"" gift was exciting. the relationship between jacob and his wolf pack was heartbreaking and noble. the new point of view from jacob was fresh. however, that is all i have to say for this book...and with it's monstrous length (over 750 pages) you would think it would be very satisfying and thorough. in my opinion, it felt rushed but full of open gaps and loopholes at the same time. not a good combination.fairy tales are supposed to be full of magic, good coincidences, and lovely endings. however, breaking dawn just seems to work out all too perfectly. problems are solved by a simple coincidence or by simple perfection. may i list a few instances? bella has a mutant spawn inside of her body, ready to kill her. solution? the baby is able to talk to edward and vice versa, and when she comes out she has super intelligence and she has the power to make everyone love her. there was a tragic love story between edward, bella, and jacob. solution? edward and bella have a baby together, jacob imprints on that baby, and they get to be one big happy family. girls might have been able to relate with bella swan in earlier books...but with breaking dawn, i can't imagine anybody who can relate to her. if you ask any girl who reads the twilight series about bella, there is a 90% chance that the girl will say ""oh, i love twilight, but i think bella is actually kind of annoying. i read the series for [insert other person here, such as edward, or jacob, or the cullens]. who knew it was possible to love a series but hate the main character? i think bella swan needs a change in character development. besides, who can relate to bella swan now, now that she has had every single desire (plus more) fulfilled so perfectly without any loss?also, you may hear from other twilight fans that the final scene with the volturi was extremely disappointing. even though i wasn't too fond of the overall story, i was looking forward to the fight. meyer even described the vampires who came to witness for the cullens enough for us to understand their skills and personalities. i grew to like these vampires. all for what? the volturi turning back and running away? wow. perhaps she should have just cut out all the pages about the extra vampires. they weren't really needed anyway.on a final note: you will either be very satisfied with breaking dawn, or you will despise it. ultimately, i think it is worth reading to know how the series ends, but that doesn't mean you'll be left with a better ending than the one in your head. and when fans are left thinking of better endings than the one the author provided...that just isn't a good thing.","i think it be certainly worth buy if you already own the other three books. might a well finish the series. if you can get away with just borrow the book, you'd probably feel a little better after read it, know that you save money.as a serious twilight series fan, i feel terrible for dislike this book, terrible for criticize meyer, but i can't like the book no matter how much i try. twilight ha have a long battle between those who prefer the relationship of jacob/bella (team jacob) and those who prefer edward/bella (team edward). break dawn wa go to be the big bang, and we be all ready and waiting. however, after read it, i can't help but think: team jacob never have a die chance, and team jacob didn't even have a chance at a *decent* ending. team edward get what they wanted, but it seem to happen tastelessly and all too perfectly. i have two word for you: convenient coincidences. this book solely thrive on convenient coincidences.the book certainly doe have a few good points. the mystery of bella's half-breed child and bella's ""shielding"" gift wa exciting. the relationship between jacob and his wolf pack wa heartbreaking and noble. the new point of view from jacob wa fresh. however, that be all i have to say for this book...and with it's monstrous length (over 750 pages) you would think it would be very satisfy and thorough. in my opinion, it felt rush but full of open gap and loophole at the same time. not a good combination.fairy tale be suppose to be full of magic, good coincidences, and lovely endings. however, break dawn just seem to work out all too perfectly. problem be solve by a simple coincidence or by simple perfection. may i list a few instances?

1,"i've drank coffee all my life.  even my mother use to give me coffee with milk in my bottle when i was just a baby.  i was probably a stressed-out, high-strung, irrepressible shaky little bundle of nerves all through my child life.  i can't remember any day in my life that i haven't had any coffee in the morning, although i will say that i don't care to drink coffee throughout the day like some people do.  i'll drink my six cups of coffee only in the morning before school or work and that will be it for me for the rest of the day.  i'll know i've had enough coffee when people see me glowing in the dark when i rush out of the house early in the morning. some mornings, i've polished off a whole pot of coffee.   i don't have to be at work till 8 am but i still get up at around 4 am so i can start slamming coffee.  sometimes, i may fall asleep again in front of my first cup of coffee, but when i snap out of my drowsiness, i'll gulp that cold cup down and then rush to the kitchen to make my next cup.  i may slam about 4 or 5 more cups of coffee into me within the next half hour before i bolt out the door to start my day.  i don't know how some people can just fly out of bed and then fly out the door to get on with their day without coffee.  of course, some people will rush out to the local starbuck's at the corner and buy that one four dollar cup of coffee and that will be all that they need for the day.  just one cup?  and at about four freakin' dollars a cup?  forget that!now listen up coffee lovers.  this keurig coffee maker is the greatest coffee maker i have ever experienced.  it'll heat up water instantly and will having you drinking your first cup of coffee within the first minute you turn your keurig on in the morning.  it has a built in timer so that you can set it to be ready to brew your first cup the moment you approach your coffee maker if you're someone who just can't wait a whole minute for it to be ready. i've become more patient since i bought my keurig.  now here's what's really unique about the keurig coffee maker.  it brews one cup at a time.  what you buy for coffee are called k-cups.  pre-packaged cups of various flavored coffees that you put in the machine to brew one cup of coffee.  there are hundreds of different flavors of national and international coffees (caffeinated and decaffeinated), and  various flavored teas, and cocoas that you buy in boxes and keep in a basket or their original boxes next to your keurig machine.  when you buy your keurig coffee maker, you will get an assortment of various flavored coffees and teas to sample to get you started with understanding the beauty of this great new coffee maker that you've brought into your home.  but, like i said, there are hundreds of other flavored coffees designed in the k-cup format for your keurig coffee maker.  you'll get order forms and website ordering information available with your keurig.  i've bought my keurig at a linen and things department store, but there are other stores that sell the keurig as well.  i was told that you can get one at target, but my local target doesn't seem to have it.  anyway, at linen and things, they also carry only a couple of flavored k-cup coffees sold next to the keurig.  usually, i'll see some k-cups from green mountain who i think is directly licensed and distributed with the keurig coffee maker.  their k-cups sell at $9.99 per box (of 18 k-cups).  so, at that price, plus california sales tax (7.75%) that works out to about 59.8 cents per cup of coffee.  that's really not too bad but you can still get it cheaper if you shop smart.  even when you order these k-cups on line directly with the k-cup companies, you'll still pay about 55 cents per cup plus the cost of shipping, which makes each cup even more expensive. i've learned that the best deal available is by buying my k-cups directly through amazon.  there are various sources that are selling k-cups through amazon and still charge shipping costs, but there are a few k-cup distributors that sell k-cups at the lowest price possible, plus charge no tax or shipping fees.  through amazon, i see that target sells a box of k-cups for $59.99 and that's for 108 k-cups.  even without the cost of shipping (yet to be added), that still works out to 55 cents per cup, minimum.  so, sorry target, i think i'll pass.  that is not the best deal.i buy my k-cups at $20 for two boxes of 25 k-cups each. (50 k-cups for twenty bucks). with no sales tax and free shipping so that works out to just 40 cents per cup.  just forty cents!!!   and there are many flavors available to choose from.  so you tell me.  would your rather pay four dollars for a cup of coffee (like at starbucks), or just 40 cents per cup?  sure, your cup may be a little smaller, but you can always have another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and so on and so on and so on...... how about 10 cups of coffee for four bucks, instead of just one?you can also buy a special reusable k-cup filter so that you can still brew your own coffee from the can if you prefer.  this keurig is not just limited to manufactured k-cups.  so, check it out my fellow coffee lovers. you'll love having this keurig in your house when you have guests.  they will love having options of which flavored coffee they'd like to try, if you'll keep various flavors available.  i still like trying new coffees.  i generally like to stick to the more bold flavored coffees.  call me crazy but i enjoy a mildly bitter harsh burn in my throat when i'm drinking my coffee.

0,"the norelco t-980 price was not much more than the cost of replacing the battery in my 10-year old norelco maverick t-3000 and i was excited about the addition of a vacuum feature. be careful what you wish for! the vacuum does its job and sink cleanup is definitely faster. but the vacuum feature tends to obscure your view of the blade edge making it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard's edge while looking in the mirror. the vacuum must be emptied by using thumb pleasure to disengage one side of a rather flimsy, curved compartment cover that swings open on a hinge that looks so weak that i'm afraid it's just a matter of time before i accidentally break either the hinge or snap the cover in half. equally delicate-feeling are the two sliding, plastic prongs used to hold the primary blade in place. yet it must be removed each time one wants to use the smaller, more accurate trimming blade. and of course the trimming blade uses similar prongs to hold it in place. my older t-3000 had a self-contained trimming blade that slid forward with a simple thumb push whenever needed and then retracted just as easily. the t-980 is larger around and heavier than the older unit... enough so that i really miss the sense of control and precision i was used to. in short, the t-980 feels clumsier, less maneuverable, and less accurate. it takes longer to complete the job due to the hassle of changing the regular blade and the trimming blade. and it really tries my patience having to be so careful not to beak one of those delicate, sliding, plastic prongs or the vacuum-compartment cover. i'm really tempted to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old t-3000.","the norelco t-980 price wa not much more than the cost of replace the battery in my 10-year old norelco maverick t-3000 and i wa excite about the addition of a vacuum feature. be careful what you wish for! the vacuum doe it job and sink cleanup be definitely faster. but the vacuum feature tend to obscure your view of the blade edge make it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard's edge while look in the mirror. the vacuum must be empty by use thumb pleasure to disengage one side of a rather flimsy, curve compartment cover that swing open on a hinge that look so weak that i'm afraid it's just a matter of time before i accidentally break either the hinge or snap the cover in half. equally delicate-feeling be the two sliding, plastic prong use to hold the primary blade in place. yet it must be remove each time one want to use the smaller, more accurate trim blade. and of course the trim blade us similar prong to hold it in place. my older t-3000 have a self-contained trim blade that slide forward with a simple thumb push whenever need and then retract just a easily. the t-980 be larger around and heavier than the older unit... enough so that i really miss the sense of control and precision i wa use to. in short, the t-980 feel clumsier, le maneuverable, and le accurate. it take longer to complete the job due to the hassle of change the regular blade and the trim blade. and it really try my patience have to be so careful not to beak one of those delicate, sliding, plastic prong or the vacuum-compartment cover. i'm really tempt to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old t-3000.",ace old cite be careful careful wish for clean lean definitely obscure your thin empty rather flimsy open so weak i'm afraid just matter equally delicate plastic primary want to small accurate trim simple need easily large round really miss able long complete due change regular pat ill

1,"saitek has always made good hardware, and the x52 was no exception. i briefly owned its predecessor, the x36, years ago, but returned it when i couldn't get the drivers to work (this was under win98, mind you), but the feel of that hefty, chunky design stuck with me. when i found out about the x52 i just had to give it another go (having already bought and been quite satisfied with a cyborg evo), and i was not disappointed. since the grip on the main stick is adjustable, even my wimpy hand fits comfortably despite the sheer size of the design. control is smooth, with perfectly tuned resistance that does not hang when centered. the throttle is adjustable; on the lowest setting it glides smoothly while on the highest it takes a fair bit of push to move. the primary and pinkie triggers are both solid metal and feel like they could take some serious abuse; the toggles on the base also feel solid. the flip cover over the primary fire button just feels awesome and is a huge improvement over the flip-down button of earlier models in this line.the programming software included with the package is extremely useful; it allows you to create separate profiles for every game you play, changing button functions and even allowing you to switch which axis is which ( very handy, since not every game recognizes them the same way; just going with default settings i found that some games would actually recognize the slider and knob controls as the rudder or roll controls and not let me change them). since i got the x52, i haven't had to mess around rebinding key commands to joystick buttons at all, which used to be a huge annoyance when reinstalling- now all i have to do is copy over my profiles and i'm set to go.i only have a few complaints about this stick:-the c button, located on the left side of the stick, is easy to press by accident due to its position and does not feel as durable as the rest of the controls.-the drivers provided on the cd are the only ones that work for me; every time i've downloaded new drivers from the saitek website they have screwed up everything and made necessary a complete wipe and reinstallation of the sst software.-some older games won't recognize the stick. to be honest, i've only had this problem with a handful of games, and they're all *really* old (win95/98 old), but the problem does exist and the sst software can't compensate for it.nonetheless, the few issues i have had do not detract from the quality of the product or my satisfaction; this is the best of its breed and it will take something truly impressive to surpass it. because the price is so much lower now than it was when i bought mine, i'd recommend this version of the x52 over the newer x52 pro model- the improvements to the new design are marginal and not really worth the extra $40-$50 unless you absolutely have to be on the cutting edge.","saitek ha always make good hardware, and the x52 wa no exception. i briefly own it predecessor, the x36, year ago, but return it when i couldn't get the driver to work (this wa under win98, mind you), but the feel of that hefty, chunky design stick with me. when i find out about the x52 i just have to give it another go (having already buy and be quite satisfy with a cyborg evo), and i wa not disappointed. since the grip on the main stick be adjustable, even my wimpy hand fit comfortably despite the sheer size of the design. control be smooth, with perfectly tune resistance that doe not hang when centered. the throttle be adjustable;

 way to accuse the fans of not understanding your work.  i think if she spent more time writing, a better book would have popped out(no pun intended).  the sad part, is that even if meyer wrote a great final book, she probably wouldn't have sold any more copies. the hype was everywhere and the bookstores bought into it.  what's even sadder, is that she basically lost a really great chance of clinching the respect from an audience that loved her.","twilight use to be story about a girl and a vampire. then it become a more interest story about a girl, vampire, and werewolf. a lot of package come with the supernatural aspect of vampire and werewolf and a lot of small town romance in between. with break dawn, meyer definitely try too hard by stick to the supernatural romance while attempt a suitable ending. neither one really happened.in the beginning, bella and edward be set up for a wedding. bella's pretty young, but marriage isn't too hard to swallow. yet. in first part, book 1, there's bite romance, edward try to protect bella, bella be frustrate by edward; the ""bread and butter"" of the twilight. however, book1 then become about make love, sex, and pregnancy. that's when the head scratch start to happen.book2, start out better but get really awkward, really fast. book2 be more about jacob, which actually help a lot. he start to take a more active role in the pack and appear somewhat decisive. then, the pregnancy issue come back into play. bella be basically be tear about from the pregnancy. everything about the birth become really really creepy, especially when jacob ""imprints"" with bella's baby at the end of book2. i suppose they're mean to be together whenever the baby learn how to walk?book3 basically become a wrap up section. the half human-half vampire baby be born, a little fight here and there, and then the stupidest part: the werewolf in la push aren't actually werewolves. they're shapeshifters!! of all the explanations...shapeshifting?

0,"this review is from: gone with the wind (dvd)      why is it that most movie ""classics"" that are cheered and applauded today turn out to be incredibly lousy? i purchased gone with the wind on dvd for my mom nearly a year ago, but it wasn't until this september that we were able to sit down and watch it. and perhaps i've been spoiled by such epics as ""lord of the rings"" and ""spider-man"", but i simply did not find gone with the wind enjoyable at all. no, it wasn't simply because there wasn't epic battles or superhero combat, but because the story itself was not entertaining.the plot: scarlet o'hara is a southern belle lady living in the lap of luxury with her mother, father, and two sisters on a plantation named tara. she is the envy of all the ladies, and the desire of all the men. yet she has her heart fixed on one specific individual, ashley wilkes. she is devastated to learn at a party that her ashley has given his heart to another woman, melanie. at the same party, famed philanderer and charmer rhett butler sees scarlet and falls in love with her.meantime, rumors of war are troubling the south. it is rumored that the union yankees are readying efforts of war against the south to free the slaves and defeat the rebels. celebration comes when it is confirmed that war is abound, and every man able rides to sign up. to get back at ashley, scarlet pledges marriage to a young man about to go into battle, but he later dies.long story made short, they all fight a big war, lots of people killed. ashley goes off to war, and leaves a pregnant wife in scarlet's care. scarlet must attempt to birth the baby in the midst of a huge battle. rhett manages to come to her aid, but then deserts her to join the army, ashamed of his previous attitude of ""only in it for the money"" service for the south. scarlet makes her way home to tara, and finds her beloved home devastated by war. her mother dead, her father half-crazy with grief, and the possessions stolen by the yankees. the rest of the doggone tale is spent chronicling scarlet's plucky and spirited attempts to save her house, and make true her pledge never to be hungry again, as well as her reckless lifestyle post-war.good: well, i know i should be able to find good in this movie, but i'm sorry! it's just that where i come from, we're used to having the main character or characters be good. i can definitely say the acting is good, the music is good, and the scale on which this movie was made certainly reflects excellent quality. bad: scarlet is a self-centered idiot who doesn't care who she hurts as long as she gets her way. she callously marries a soldier who is killed in battle, and then despises her mourning clothes she must wear after that. she finally casts off her false mourning to dance with rhett. she marries another man her sister was in love with, simply to get his money so she can pay off massive taxes on tara. she stupidly clings to a love for ashley despite his marriage to melanie. interestingly enough, when we are first introduced to rhett butler, he's a renown scoundrel, yet even his heart is saddened by the war, and moved by love. yet scarlet seems to obtain rhett's attitude of ""only in it for the money"". aside from the morally bankrupt characters, the movie over all is not a positive, upbeat film one might enjoy watching. death, bloodshed, and violence pervade the film. did all this stuff happen? of course! is it being reclusive and callous not to want to concentrate on all the evils that took place in the civil war? i think not. thoughts: there is something about this movie that seems to attract fans, despite being fraught with spiteful, cruel characters. perhaps it is the massive scale on which the movie is shot. there is no question the cinematography is very well done. the music is gorgeous. the acting is commendable. the clothes are a reason often touted when i ask with genuine curiosity ""why did you like this movie?"" but i still must raise objections to good acting, music, and cinematography all surrounding a bunch of 1800's jerks. you decide. i personally was disappointed to recognize the actor playing ashley wilkes as the actor who had previously starred in an ancient tv serial of sherlock holmes. the man was perfect for the role, and carried it out brilliantly, so to see him as the sniveling rebel soldier was almost sad for me. i've gotten my main point across, but being as this movie is a genuine classic, i don't doubt most of you will want to buy it. if you do, you'll probably prefer the dvd. *note* the dvd contains hardly any extras: theatrical trailer, and a few quizzes. i give this movie 2 out of 10 stars.","this review be from: go with the wind (dvd) why be it that most movie ""classics"" that be cheer and applaud today turn out to be incredibly lousy?

1,"i was just about jaded with all these new hd cameras, when i ran into this by accident, scanning through google.i had purchased an kodak easyshare m1033, then a zi6, they both failed miserably at even coming close to standard definition, let alone high definition. they had alot of motion artifact, alot of graininess at any light exposure, and were useless in the dark. they went to new owners.i had about given up until i saw this when perusing products at 2009 ces. i have had it one day, but it surpasses the products that i have used and that are out there.first off, images are clear, for real, not grainy. it actually has 4 different light settings - sports, landscape, backlight, and lowlight. none of the other 'pocket cameras' have this. this is extremely important, or you can forget recording video in your home.secondly, it has an led light that can be utilized to record in the dark...what a great idea!!! it maximizes battery life, and extends your video range. amazing difference.next, it has a real optical zoom, not some fake digital zoom. at whats more, when you zoom, it doesnt blurr, like the nikon and kodak video footage i have seen and made. another gigantic leap.it has all necessary connectivity, component cables, usb, and it is very intuitive to use. after about 30 minutes with it, you can film your own documentary. but even in simple terms, once the clock is set you can start filming immediately. just change from sports setting to another light setting before you start, or you will see a black screen indoors. oh, and, take the lens cap off.ok, memory, it has 12mb onboard, which will get you a few pics, and 15 seconds of hd video. yeah, eh...but it does have a pro duo slot. i was certainly not excited about this, i have alot of sd cards lying around. but i looked for a good deal, and dealt with it. video compression is nice, and you get about 1 sec per mb, or about 140 min with an 8gb card. this is actually better than the kodak compression, as far as storage.also, videos are simple to use. simple to play on a computer, just plug in the usb, you dont need a pro duo slot on your pc. i uploaded easily to youtube, and also played them nicely on my 42"" big screen. another plus, it runs through all the videos with one click. some folks may not like this, but i dont like to click on all 40 videos i recorded, just play em all, and skip if you want. otherwise, you would be sitting by the tv changing them the whole time, while everyone else enjoys. nice idea, sony.sony thought of other nice things as well, including wrist strap, concise packaging, lens cap strap, and nice charging setup. leave those aas at home kodak zi6. it even takes pictures!take it from me, the webbie does much more than anything else out there in the $150-$400. if you are going to spend $200 anyway, why not get a serious camera that blows away the competition. you wont be disappointed. this will be the camera everyone has within 3 months.","i wa just about jade with all these new hd cameras, when i run into this by accident, scan through google.i have purchase an kodak easyshare m1033, then a zi6, they both fail miserably at even come close to standard definition, let alone high definition. they have alot of motion artifact, alot of graininess at any light exposure, and be useless in the dark. they go to new owners.i have about give up until i saw this when peruse product at 2009 ces. i have have it one day, but it surpass the product that i have use and that be out there.first off, image be clear, for real, not grainy. it actually ha 4 different light set - sports, landscape, backlight, and lowlight. none of the other 'pocket cameras' have this. this be extremely important, or you can forget record video in your home.secondly, it ha an lead light that can be utilize to record in the dark...what a great idea!!!

no. this was the ending i was expecting, the ending i had hoped for, and the way i think things should have all turned out.and jacob...book ii was really hard for me because i have always really liked jacob. even though i thought bella and edward were destined to be together, i wanted happiness for jacob. i completely never saw the imprint with nessie coming, but strangely enough, it works for me. everything works out and everyone is happy.  stephenie meyer--if you are reading these things anyway, i hope you read some of the good reviews too, because there are alot of people out there who really loved all your books! thank you for what is probably my favorite books series ever. i look forward to midnight sun, (hopefully) all four movies, and anything else you might decide to write! keep up the wonderful work, and thank you again!","spoiler alert!!everyone really need to back off on stephenie meyer a little bit. break dawn wa a wonderful book, a perfect end to an amaze series. the only bad thing i have to say about it be that you just come to care about what happen to each character so much that the book be quite emotionally exhausting, and i don't even consider that a actually bad. it's great. everyone on here be talk about the ""message"" the book send that it's okay to get married, have kids, no college, whatever, by age 18. i don't honestly think stephenie meyer mean for this to be her ""message."" i think she want to write an amazing, excite story about true love that involve character that people really care about. if there's any message, it's about fight to make thing work for true love, a both edward and bella have always done, or the importance of family. and it doe not always have to be college vs. marriage/family. bella be immortal, she ha her whole life to get a degree if she choose too. but honestly, she get everything that wa most important to her in life--a almost-perfect husband who ha make her the center of his world, a wonderful daughter, her best friend jacob, and all the rest of her family. in the end, i think stephenie meyer realize that these thing be the most important thing in the world anyway. everyone be just read way more into this than i think ms. meyer mean for it to be. i actually think bella grow up alot in this book, esspecially after reneesee's birth and her change. i love how, in the end, bella and edward more equal, and she get the chance to be the hero for once; she have the power to take care of herself and all those people that she loved. someone have a problem with bella get everything she want without have to sacrifice anything?

1,"this review is from: iron man (two-disc special collectors' edition) (dvd)      it's been a long time since i've seen a movie in the movie theaters (having a one-year old will do that to you).  i've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (i'm looking at you, entertainment weekly).  when we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  and that movie was iron man.by now everyone knows the story of iron man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire tony stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  instead of making weapons, stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.iron man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like middle eastern terrorists.  all this drama is tempered by robert downey jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  his keeper is obadiah stane (played by jeff bridges with suitable cranky menace).  stark's assistant is the alliterative pepper potts (gwyneth paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly naïve and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.  at its best, iron man features stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  the theater i was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  i imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.there are plot holes. vanity fair reporters show up at important news conferences. stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  and the entire premise of iron man revolves around ""repulsor lift"" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. but if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?iron man keeps the plot tight. unlike spider-man, there are no extraneous supervillains. unlike x-men, every character is there for a reason.  but the big payoff for iron man is the ending.  iron man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  then it leaves you begging for more. and there is more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  unfortunately, i didn't read enough spoilers to realize i should have waited, so we missed it.  so for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!","this review be from: iron man (two-disc special

0,"like the other books in the twilight series, the story was creative and interesting and character development was strong. however, those are the only good things about the books. in my opinion, i thought this final book in the twilight saga had the most flaws. one example was bella. i've noticed that she doesn't have any self concern for herself, and it's even more clear in this book. after she had sex with edward, he accidently gave her bruises all over. instead of thinking about the danger, she got pissed because edward's concern for her was ruining her fun. even worse, she kept begging him for more sex and even wept about it, until he gave in. this showed how selfish she was and how far she would go to get what she wanted. she did not use logic, and all she thought about was sex. she even wanted to postpone the date of her transformation into a vampire because of sex. i guess the author was trying to say that sex is the only good thing about being human. that's a rotten message. so my point, i guess, is that there's nothing good about bella, and is a bad role model. she was so selfish and whiny, i believe that edward loved her only because she was the only person whose mind he couldn't read, which made her stand out from everyone else.secondly, bella's pregnancy shouldn't have occurred. stephanie said that vampires were completely filled with venom, so there was no way edward could have gotten bella pregnant. this indicated that stephanie wasn't a good writer, because she was breaking her own rules. vampires don't even have tears, yet male vampires have sperm? it doesn't make any sense.i also agreed with some of the other reviewers that bella got everything she wanted without much of a problem. this was unrealistic, because people have to fight for some things in order to gain them. but bella easily got everything she wanted. a baby, which i already said shouldn't have existed based on stephanie's rules about vampires (but probably included to make bella and rosalie happy) and the ability to have excellent self control and can be around humans. yes, stephanie meyer used the excuse that bella had better self control because she was aware of the conflicts of being a vampire, but she still would have suffered immense thirst when she became a newborn, which was natural. but no, meyer made bella have a lot better self control than most other vampires, so as to make her happy and still talk to charlie. like i said, unrealistic. so all in all, i thought this book was a disappointment. it has poor literary value. so if you want to read it, have fun but don't be influenced by everything stephanie meyer writes, because some parts are trash.","like the other book in the twilight series, the story wa creative and interest and character development wa strong. however, those be the only good thing about the books. in my opinion, i think this final book in the twilight saga have the most flaws. one example wa bella. i've notice that she doesn't have any self concern for herself, and it's even more clear in this book. after she have sex with edward, he accidently give her bruise all over. instead of think about the danger, she get piss because edward's concern for her wa ruin her fun. even worse, she keep beg him for more sex and even weep about it, until he give in. this show how selfish she wa and how far she would go to get what she wanted. she do not use logic, and all she think about wa sex. she even want to postpone the date of her transformation into a vampire because of sex. i guess the author wa try to say that sex be the only good thing about be human. that's a rotten message. so my point, i guess, be that there's nothing good about bella, and be a bad role model. she wa so selfish and whiny, i believe that edward love her only because she wa the only person whose mind he couldn't read, which make her stand out from everyone else.secondly, bella's pregnancy shouldn't have occurred. stephanie say that vampire be completely fill with venom, so there wa no way edward could have get bella pregnant. this indicate that stephanie wasn't a good writer, because she wa break her own rules. vampire don't even have tears, yet male vampire have sperm?

1,"this is a fantastic camera but people need to have more realistic expectations of what to expect from avchd. it is a highly compressed format so using this camera in low-light conditions is going to produce pretty ""grainy"" results. in good lighting avchd output from this camera can produce some really great looking results in hd but don't kid yourself into thinking you're going to get professional hdtv quality. this is a point-and-shoot.i love the camera, especially how fast it focuses in good light, so i'm going to concentrate on what some of the other reviewers said to correct some misconceptions.i use both macs and pc and i have to tell you that you that pcs suck for avchd - you will waste a lot of time and pull your hair out. i'm sure pc video software vendors will address this eventually, but seriously folks if you want to do this the easy way get an intel-based mac (caveat: only intel based machines using leopard support avchd) and use either imovie or final cut express 4. both of these programs (imovie 08 and fce4) just love this camera (and two other sony avchd cameras i've tried as well) and they work like a charm. video making has never been this easy.  fce4 lets you mix avhcd, hdv and sd video on the same timeline and save in whatever format you want so it's worth the $200 if you want to do that or have more exacting control over your videos. it is basically a (lightly) stripped-down version of apple's excellent professional video software (final cut pro) and it is very good. for most home videos imovie 08 (which comes in ilife 08) will be just fine. i've had no problem transferring the movies directly from the camera but, as mentioned earlier, you do need to have the camera plugged into the ac to do it. you can avoid plugging the camera into your mac to transfer the files if you're only recording on sdhc cards, rather than internal memory on the hf10, but it works just fine. for this reason i would recommend buying the hf100 (over the hf10) and getting an extra 16gb memory card or two. you will save money that way and have more flexibility. i bought the hf10 because i had to have it the next day and, at the time, the hf100s were delayed a bit. transcend's excellent 16gb sdhc class 6 card comes with a nifty little card reader for only $78.98 here on amazon, you can get two of them for less than the $200 difference in price between the hf10 and hf100 so you'll have 32gb to work with instead of 16gb for less money. i don't mind having the internal memory as a backup but you pay more than it is worth for it. the video camera is just acting like a usb reader when you connect it to your mac anyway - it is the file layouts that the software recognizes. when read in and converted to apple intermediate codec at 1920x1080 they will balloon in size. if you want to store the raw video in a more compressed way you can simply copy the root directory of the card to another directory and copy it back again later. if you're working with avchd you need to buy the biggest hard drives you can afford. 60 minutes of video will use up something like 50gb of storage on your mac when converted to 1920x1080. if you just want great looking home video to show on your hdtv, but don't want to go broke on hard drives, apple offers to import the movies at a slightly lower resolution (960x540) which takes up a lot less space with very little drop in quality.  i have been making home videos and showing them on an apple tv at that resolution and they look stunning. the quality difference between that resolution and full hd isn't that big of a deal.  if want to try to get truly professional-quality video you should avoid avchd cameras and stick to the hdv format concentrating on cameras with larger sensors.  but this is great camera for hd home videos at a great price. the user interface on this camera is slow and clunky. sony's avchd cameras have a better interface (using a touch screen) but you can still watch back the videos (which is the main thing you'll do) and it beats the heck out of a tape camera.  i wish they had added a dial or button set for adjust exposure and/or backlighting control on the camera. the joystick works surprisingly well for this however in bright light the screen gets washed out enough that it is hard to tell if your exposure is really that great or not. this is where a viewfinder would really help. but these are minor nits because the camera does a good job at exposure control on its own. as i said earlier this is a very compact point-and-shoot camera that shoots hd video and for that it's excellent.","this be a fantastic camera but people need to have more realistic expectation of what to expect from avchd. it be a highly compress format so use this camera in low-light condition be go to produce pretty ""grainy"" results. in good light avchd output from this camera can produce some really great look result in hd but don't kid yourself into think you're go to get professional hdtv quality. this be a point-and-shoot.i love the camera, especially how fast it focus in good light, so i'm go to concentrate on what some of the other reviewer say to correct some misconceptions.i use both mac and pc and i have to tell you that you that pc suck for avchd -

1,"this review is from: iron man [theatrical release] (theatrical release)      ""iron man"" is good.  damn good.  i'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (i've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what i've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  but i can tell you this: it is a good movie.  a good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.tony stark is a billionaire playboy.  he's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  his company (created by his father, co-run by obediah stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the army, and so stark's best friend is an army officer in charge of the special weapons division.  life is good...until, on a promotional trip in afghanistan, something goes wrong.  stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  the magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...i had my doubts when i heard robert downey jr. was cast in the role.  don't get me wrong--i am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  i was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  thank god, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (i've heard that downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled tony stark.  jeff bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that i was at first convinced he was william hurt (sorry, jeff), i was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (and no offense to william hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in ""the incredible hulk."")terrence howard and gwyneth paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  the script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not all movies have to break new ground).  both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with ac/dc, and i sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, ""really?  you couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?""  fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  and the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  and then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will definitely be a sequel; and two, that samuel l. jackson really is in every movie ever made.so go see ""iron man.""  that's the gist of it.  there's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what i've heard, the comics did the same with the vietnam war, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  but overall, ""iron man"" is just a good time.  it's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  and stan lee gets to play a pimp.  i mean, really now.  you have to go see it for that, if nothing else.","this review be from: iron man [theatrical release] (theatrical release) ""iron man"" be good. damn good. i'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (i've never be much of a comic book guy), though from what i've hear from my comic-reading friends, it is. but i can tell you this: it be a good movie. a good movie that just so happen to be base upon a comic book character.tony stark be a billionaire playboy. he's a womanizer and a partier, who ha a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, ha a soft spot for him in return). his company (created by his father, co-run by obediah stane) provide high-tech weaponry to the army, and so stark's best friend be an army officer in charge of the special weapon division. life be good...until, on a promotional trip in afghanistan, something go wrong. stark's motorcade be ambushed...mortally wounded, stark be take captive keep alive through the use of a magnet that be keep some shrapnel from enter his heart. the magnet give him an idea...an idea for a suit...i have my doubt when i hear robert downey jr. wa cast in the role. don't get me wrong--i be a huge fan of his, and wa determine to see the movie. i wa just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material. thank god, everyone else involve in make the movie wa on the same page (i've hear that downey apparently have a lot of say in various aspect of the film, and there wa a lot of improvise dialogue). downey pull it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else play the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled tony stark. jeff bridge be a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that i wa at first convince he wa william hurt (sorry, jeff), i wa absolutely captivate by his performance.

0,"this review is from: transformers (two-disc special edition) [hd dvd] (hd dvd)      transformers has great potential and some moments that show you it could've been so much more than it turned out to be and yet it disappoints by what it mostly is. there truly is more than meets the eye to this film but i don't really like what i see.transformers falls victim to being another typical hollywood project that's chock full of the standard thoughts and beliefs of a humanistic, secular and liberal society. michael bay and company stuffed this film with so much hollywood fluff that the story about the transformers broke under the weight of it. there are so many places where this movie goes wrong. first, it focuses waaaaay too much on everyone else in the film except the actual transformers. the movie is called transformers isn't it? we're not given much of any story, background or character on the transformers themselves. there's almost no connection to the old 80's cartoon and the most history we get to see is in the form of a short flashback. they give us a hint of the conflict between starscream and megatron but couldn't give anymore because the movie ran so long on human stories. there's just so much time wasted on the human characters that we're not here to see. if you take out megan fox and her character altogether, the movie becomes instantly better. i didn't put down my money to see how hot the director thinks she is with the close up shots of her or to see another movie about teenage romance. about them getting to know each other, getting past their differences and falling in love. i really don't want to see it as i really don't care. sam's parents are annoying and also get more time on screen than they have a right to. even the soldiers are on for too long. i think there was so much confusion here as to how to build the humans around the robots that they ended up building the robots around the humans. as a kid, i was a huge fan of the cartoon in the 80's and the show did well enough with very little human interaction.second, it's obvious that the writers and director here are very leftist liberals who are bent on preaching their secular humanism. here are a few of the things i picked up on. sam's mother asks if he was masturbating in his room because he had it locked. she then proceed's to tell him that ""it's ok"" if he was. his parents then discover that a girl was hiding in his room and congratulate him for it. so it's ok for a teenage boy to have a girl alone with him in his bedroom with the door locked? okay? then there's a few instances that reflect an anti-government, anti-authority attitude, but then they still remain pro-military as is popular today. plus a little knock at president bush, (yeah we know who the voice is supposed to sound like), and it's always popular to mock and insult him. add to that the fact that the only person wearing a cross is the most unlikable character in the movie and it's readily apparent where the people behind this movie are coming from. before you tell me ""it's only a movie"", don't deceive yourself into thinking that the media doesn't promote it's own ideas through it's mediums. hollywood tells you exactly where it's coming from through t.v. and movies. i also didn't care for the cussing. they could've removed it altogether and it would'nt have changed a thing. the people involved in this movie know darn well that the audience will be a largely younger one. but i guess filthy language and sexuality are also some of our promoted and accepted traits in this country, so here they are. third, they want to bring the transformers into our world today but make alot of the people and situations unbelievable. i'd like to never see another movie where ""joe nobody's"" are suddenly allowed to be involved in a military resistance or are suddenly allowed to see and be included in the plans of top secret, underground, government agencies. megan fox's character isn't scared when she first sees a giant decepticon coming right for her and sam. she doesn't scream or freak out or anything. not only that but when she and sam are being chased by the smaller one, she immediately looks for a weapon to fight it, then does. come on, are we really supposed to believe this? it's not only her though as it seems everyone wants to be the hero here and has no problem fighting with these giant alien robots that no one knows about. everyone seems to just jump right into action. like the earth is populated with superheroes. and they make optimus prime our biggest cheerleader. he's full of comments of how great we are and how they need us and couldn't achieve victory without us. since when did the autobots ever need us?fourth, they only got one of the original voice actors for the transformers themselves. you could pull it off without most of them i guess but they should've got the originals or at least sound-a-likes for megatron or starscream, as they had classic and recognizable voices. i'm glad that they got peter cullen to reprise his role as the voice of optimus but he should've been able to also do ironhide as he used to.fifth, the product placement went to a new level of shameless with the cars and just about everything you see in the film. they could've used some clips of the movie for commercials.sixth, there are some moments here that just feel juvenile. the teen moments in school, at the park, with the parents, and the rock music on two of the action chases feel made for a teenage audience. even as a young adult, i found them hard to sit through. and don't even get me started on the lame dialog. there's not a smart or insightful spoken word throughout.the things i do like here are pretty obvious. i like the action, the graphics and the transformers themselves. when they're on screen, the movie is alot more interesting and it makes you just want to see and learn more about them. why didn't they just start the film with their war on their world, instead of just a flashback? it would've bee so much more interesting. this really should've been a straight up, sci fi action film. i accept the new look of the robots and the transforming animations are incredible.which brings me to the disc itself. i have seen both the standard and hd dvd versions and there's a pretty noticeble difference between them when comparing them. they're both very good though and your gonna be fine with either one you choose. the standard disc still looks and sounds very impressive. on a good t.v. and home theater, you won't feel like your missing out if you don't have the hd version. if you want the hd dvd version, which will be the same when it's released it on blu-ray, you'll want to have a very good hdtv and sound sysytem to make you happy you paid the extra money. it looks and sounds great to be sure but not so much that it makes the sd version look and sound bad. the 2 are actually pretty close and will equally satisfy.i really wanted to like transformers more than i do. but the things that bug me, really bug me. so much, that i find myself skipping through the slow, human story parts to get to the better stuff. that's not good. i don't own many, if any movies, where i have to do that. those parts just bog the film down, make it longer and make it feel alot longer than it is. i hope they do better with the upcoming sequel, i don't think they will but here's to hoping. i give this one 2 stars for the effects studio who provided the excellent graphics and battle sequences, without those, it gets no stars. if you want a movie about uninteresting, stereotypical people (spineless loser guy, losers ""cool"" parents, ex thief/mechanic super girl, hip teen hackers, soft hearted military heroes, ""evil"" government) in unbelievable situations, sprinkled with some sci fi action in the form of robots, then you'll be happy. if you want sci fi action, something like the cartoons you may remember, and a smart and challenging film then your gonna struggle here. if your not a lefty liberal, looking for another celebration of secular humanism, your gonna struggle even more. if those things are a concern, rent before you buy.","this review be from: transformer (two-disc special edition) [hd dvd] (hd dvd) transformer ha great potential and some moment that show you it could've be so much more than it turn out to be and yet it disappoint by what it mostly is. there truly be more than meet the eye to this film but i don't really like what i see.transformers fall victim to be another typical hollywood project that's chock full of the standard think and belief of a humanistic, secular and liberal society. michael bay and company stuff this film with so much hollywood fluff that the story about the transformer break under the weight of it. there be so many place where this movie go wrong. first, it focus waaaaay too much on everyone else in the film except the actual transformers. the movie be call transformer isn't it?

0,"i have used braun shavers for over 15 years and i have loved them. until now. after 4 years of great service my 7500 series braun broke. with a track record like that, i was definitely buying another braun. i figured a razor is something i should spend extra on since i use it every day, so i bought the very pricey 9595. i have come to regret it. it became clear early on that this one wasn't as good as the one that it replaced. after 3 months of daily use, i'm very frustrated and rather angry. - noise. the pulsonic razor is really noisy. much noisier than the 7500 series.- recharger/cleaner is very poorly designed. rather than using a direct plug in connection, it has contacts on the razor and on the base that need to line up. this works until the razor starts cleaning, vibrating the razor. this causes it to lose connection and stop working. it normally takes four tries to get it to complete a cleaning cycle. there is no correct way to insert the shaver to guarantee it will complete  cleaning cycle. - less information is less information. the old 7500 series told me how long the shave took and how much charge in minutes were left. the 9500 series has cell phone type bars for power and hygene, no read out on time taken to shave. after using this razor for 3 months, i think they removed the time taken to shave feature for a reason. - takes too long to get all the missed spots. it takes 50% longer to get a good shave than with the 7500 series. - excessive packaging. packaging has no influence on those of us who buy through the web, but i will note the packing is excessive and wasteful. - gimmicky. i have noticed no benefits of ""sonic"" over a regular electric razor. after another time consuming shave and three attempts to get the razor to clean itself, i called customer service. they weren't very nice and wanted me to ship the charger to another city. thanks for nothing. i have gone from a loyal braun customer to someone who will never buy another braun (or proctor and gamble marketed) electronic product. update: i still hate this razor and the shaves have gotten even worse. it takes forever to shave with this thing. it is the worst shaver i have had in 18 years of shaving. i can't believe i paid over $200 for this pos.","i have use braun shaver for over 15 year and i have love them. until now. after 4 year of great service my 7500 series braun broke. with a track record like that, i wa definitely buy another braun. i figure a razor be something i should spend extra on since i use it every day, so i buy the very pricey 9595. i have come to regret it. it become clear early on that this one wasn't a good a the one that it replaced. after 3 month of daily use, i'm very frustrate and rather angry. - noise. the pulsonic razor be really noisy. much noisier than the 7500 series.- recharger/cleaner be very poorly designed. rather than use a direct plug in connection, it ha contact on the razor and on the base that need to line up. this work until the razor start cleaning, vibrate the razor. this cause it to lose connection and stop working. it normally take four try to get it to complete a clean cycle. there be no correct way to insert the shaver to guarantee it will complete clean cycle. - le information be le information. the old 7500 series tell me how long the shave take and how much charge in minute be left. the 9500 series ha cell phone type bar for power and hygene, no read out on time take to shave. after use this razor for 3 months, i think they remove the time take to shave feature for a reason. - take too long to get all the miss spots. it take 50% longer to get a good shave than with the 7500 series. - excessive packaging. package ha no influence on those of u who buy through the web, but i will note the pack be excessive and wasteful. - gimmicky. i have notice no benefit of ""sonic"" over a regular electric razor. after another time consume shave and three attempt to get the razor to clean itself, i call customer service. they weren't very nice and want me to ship the charger to another city. thank for nothing. i have go from a loyal braun customer to someone who will never buy another braun (or proctor and gamble marketed) electronic product. update: i still hate this razor and the shave have get even worse. it take forever to shave with this thing. it be the worst shaver i have have in 18 year of shaving. i can't believe i pay over $200 for this pos.",love of great service great like definitely thin regret clear good ace rather angry really noisy charge clean lean poor dire tact base need star leaning normally complete correct ill old how minute on time too long miss excessive rough wasteful fit regular attempt nice want thank for nothing loyal still hate even worst

0,"**spoilers** i was really excited for breaking dawn to come out.  i mean really excited.  so like a good twihard i got my book right at 12:01 and stayed up all night to read it straight through.  the beginning was pretty good and seemed to flow with the style of the other twilight books.  i liked the wedding, but after that things started to get weird.  the honeymoon wasn't terrible, until bella got preggers.  i was like wtf?! but i went with it, trusting steph to explain this so it made some sense.  well, i'm still waiting for that explantation.  then all of a sudden it switched to jacob's pov.  i really didn't want to switch at first, but i quickly warmed to jake's pov.  i liked learning more about leah.  that, however, like so many things in this book turned out to be a dead end and complete waste of my time.  because guess what? as soon as that demon child is born...jacob imprints on her.  so the one character left who i could relate to goes over to the dark side and becomes unrecoginzable just like everyone else.  my other wtf?! moment was when bella told everyone what she was going to name said demon.  renesmee carlie.  please tell me that that name is some kind of sick horrible joke gone wrong.  it was just so tacky to combine everyones name like that.  i actually thought the cullens had some style and dignity.  my bad.  next thing we know bella was a vampire.  this part of the book was okay.  until i find out that bella is basically perfect.  how am i supposed to relate to that?  then we are introduced about 800 new characters near the end of the book.  it all builds up to what is supposed to be an awesome climax to the story.  which ends up dragging on forever and nothing actually happens.  great, everyone is perfect and none of them even die to even things out (although i am not sure i would've cared by this point because i'd kinda started disliking/hating everyone by then).  the end.  wow.  it took awhile for it to sink in how much i really hated the book because i just felt a little numb for about the next 24 hours.  then it slowly sank it and i started fighting the urge to burn the book. instead i started writing really long rants (sorry btw) on the internet. the horrid and boring plot totally took over the characters.  they were constantly ooc.this book doesn't even seem like it was written by sm.  so i have a few theories about that.  theory #1 she was smoking somethin really strong the whole time she was writing.  plus she got the stuff from her editor who also seems to have been delusional during the production of this book.  theory #2 the host is not actually a fictional book at all, but rather a true story.  stephanie was taken over by an alien who had no idea how to write, but felt compelled to still finish the series.  theory #3 stephanie felt rushed/pressured to finish the book.  she couldn't think of anything so she just copy and pasted a bunch of crappy fanfics to make up breaking dawn.also for all of you out there who were throughly disappointed by bd we have a facebook group.  it's called ""is it just me, or did breaking dawn suck like a newbornd vampire on a human?""  all breaking dawn haters, we must unite!!! so join the group already, sheesh.sorry agian about the length.","**spoilers** i wa really excite for break dawn to come out. i mean really excited. so like a good twihard i get my book right at 12:01 and stay up all night to read it straight through. the begin wa pretty good and seem to flow with the style of the other twilight books. i like the wedding, but after that thing start to get weird. the honeymoon wasn't terrible, until bella get preggers. i wa like wtf?! but i go with it, trust steph to explain this so it make some sense. well, i'm still wait for that explantation. then all of a sudden it switch to jacob's pov. i really didn't want to switch at first, but i quickly warm to jake's pov. i like learn more about leah. that, however, like so many thing in this book turn out to be a dead end and complete waste of my time. because guess what?

1,"customer review from the amazon vine™ program (what's this?)      i am making the switch from a traditional blade and shave-gel to electric shaving system with the philips norelco 8240xl. based on my experience a few years ago which left me with irritated skin and ingrown hairs, i was not expecting much. after a few weeks of use, i am pleasantly surprised. no skin irritation or any more ingrown hairs than i get with traditional shaving. pluses: it is easy to use and much faster than traditional shaving. after using it, it is very easy to clean using the included brush. the kit includes a small charger (no bulky transformer which makes transportation easier) and a collapsible case. i appreciate the case versus the hard case i had with the shaver i used a few years ago; the form factor for storage is convenient and thoughtful.minuses: 1. it leaves a mess. every time i shave the counter is scattered with little hairs. rather than gathering them up in a lather like traditional shaving or keeping them inside (which would require more frequent cleanings), the 8240xl seems to just spit the little hairs all over a 3 foot diameter. it, therefore, requires a little more cleanup than traditional shaving and is not as good for shaving in the car as i might have hoped. 2. not good for long hairs. it is very effective at clipping off day-old hairs. as hairs get longer it tends to miss them. this is a self-perpetuating problem. if i shave quickly and leave a few stragglers, there is a lesser chance that these will be clipped off tomorrow than the shorter ones. after a few days i have a few long hairs among a well-shaven face. at that point, i give it a run with the traditional razor which takes care of it. likewise, if i skip shaving for a few days between workdays, it is pretty much useless, very slow, and somewhat more irritating to my skin than traditional shaving. that said, if i'm careful to do a thorough job each morning without skipping days, the 8240xl is very effective and quite a bit more time-efficient than my old method. understanding its limitations and maximizing its benefits, i am happy to make daily use of the norelco 8240xl supplementing it with traditional shaving at times. especially considering the low price point, i would recommend the 8240xl with some cautions to those considering it.","customer review from the amazon vine™ program (what's this?) i be make the switch from a traditional blade and shave-gel to electric shave system with the philip norelco 8240xl. base on my experience a few year ago which leave me with irritate skin and ingrown hairs, i wa not expect much. after a few week of use, i be pleasantly surprised. no skin irritation or any more ingrown hair than i get with traditional shaving. pluses: it be easy to use and much faster than traditional shaving. after use it, it be very easy to clean use the include brush. the kit include a small charger (no bulky transformer which make transportation easier) and a collapsible case. i appreciate the case versus the hard case i have with the shaver i use a few year ago;

(good night, and good luck). i think most people know downey jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and i could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws. you also need a good villain, and obadiah stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. played very well by the surprising jeff bridges (tideland), i found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that tony (downey jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost. we get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of pepper potts (gwyneth paltrow, proof), tony stark's life secretary. the drop-dead gorgeous dress that potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.another huge plus for the film is the amazing cgi. never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. this is, in part, thanks to downey jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his iron man suit off the ground. it's also hilarious to watch tony stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).i also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue: stark: ""okay, seriously, i feel like you're driving me to court martial. this is crazy. what did i do? i feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. what, you're not allowed to talk? hey, forest...""jimmy: ""we can talk, sir."" stark: ""oh, i see. so it's personal. alright.""ramirez: ""you intimidate them, sir.""stark: ""good god, you're a woman! i honestly couldn't have called that. i mean, i would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? i thought of you as a soldier first.""ramirez: ""i'm an airman.""stark: ""well you actually have excellent bone structure there. i'm having a hard time not looking at you now. is that weird?""this kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but iron man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. it's well-deserving of the title ""blockbuster."" and if you really want to see what lay ahead for iron man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. you'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.","this review be from: iron man [theatrical release] (theatrical release) with a meteoric rise from first-time film make marvel enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.to start with, iron man need a great lead character. tony stark be know to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. so who better to inhabit this persona than robert downey jr.

0,"i've had the capresso 560 for nearly three years and, though it has served me well enough, it has never failed to give plenty of bad with the good. yes, it can produce espresso-level grind. yes, it produces a good, consistent grind that makes great coffee. so? what's the problem: 1) when i first got it, the burrs were miscalibrated and it would not grind finely enough. i call to customer service eventually fixed this. 2) from the first couple weeks, the bean and grind bins developed hairline fractures. though they've never completely broken, they are now almost opaque from this complex spiderwebbing. 3) the indicator line on the bean bin rubbed off after only a couple of months. i etched it back on myself, but it was never easy to read. compare to the baratza maetro (my new grinder) on which the line is molded into the plastic. 4) about 2 years in, the grind indicator lines around the bean bin also began to wear off. as of its recent retirement, the body of the grinder is almost totally devoid of writing. none more black. 5) hate the timer knob. prefer a on/off switch. the timer was never long enough to grind enough beans for a full pot of coffee (12+ cups) and encouraged using the bean bin as an on off switch (in fact, the manual may have instructed using it this way). i feel certain that the constant turning of the bean bin led to the premature failure of the safety mechanism (see below). 6) recently (and without warning) the safety (the mechanism that keeps the grinder from running with the bean bin removed. started making only sporadic contact, meaning the grinder couldn't get up to speed or even work at all. call to customer service claimed they'd never heard of such a thing and fixing/replacing would be $60. perhaps that a reasonable amount of time for such a failure, but the cost of repair and lack of access to the mechanism means the grinder is essentially trash. i may try to crack it open a fix it to use as a backup grinder, but it made more sense to just replace it with the superior baratza maestro. bottom line: if you have one, you're probably satisfied. if you don't, the maestro looks like a better grinder for the same (nearly same) money. it has more grind settings, more durable clear plastic parts, produces less static, is quieter, and has an on/off switch. maybe i'll be replacing it in three years too, but it seems a far more durable product.","i've have the capresso 560 for nearly three year and, though it ha serve me well enough, it ha never fail to give plenty of bad with the good. yes, it can produce espresso-level grind. yes, it produce a good, consistent grind that make great coffee. so?

when there are a lot of peripherals to carry around, it defeats this purpose. the cap is also a problem because it becomes loose with time and it's easy to lose.casing: the drive is truly water resistant (as long as you still have your cap). it has a rubber shell that's pleasant to touch and it bounces when dropped. the more important aspect of this rubber texture is the fact that it grabs a hold of the inside of your pocket. unlike some of the other reviews i've read, i actually like it .it's more difficult to accidently lose the drive when removing other objects from your pocket, like change.design: it's fairly ugly and it looks like an adult toy due to its size. sorry, corsair, but it does!file system: it is formatted as fat32. you cannot copy files larger than 4 gigabytes in size onto the drive because of this. i formatted mine to ntfs, which turned out to be a big mistake! do not format it as ntfs!!! you will lose considerable read/write speeds if you do, even with a larger cluster size, say 16k. ntfs also burns out flash drives much quicker than fat32 because ntfs writes to the drive even if files are only read. also, once you change it to ntfs you'll have a hard time getting it back to fat32 if you're on windows: you'll need 3rd party software to do it, like acronis disk director suite.speed: tested on windows vista ultimate. i feel very disappointed with the speed of the drive. read speeds were alright, but the write speeds are unacceptable. with the fat32 file system write speeds average 1-1.3 mbps. ehh. with ntfs write speeds deteriorated to 300 kbps! now that is slllooooowwww. keep it as fat32 like i recommended before.conclusion: the drive is too big physically to be a flash drive and too slow to be comparable to an external hard drive. if you want portable storage with this kind of capacity, get an external hard drive instead. the technology just isn't there right now to really be useful. i recommend a wd passport as a substitute.","here's my comprehensive review. enjoy!size: the corsair 64gb flash drive be quite large... it's a long a my wd passport external hard drive and a fat a my thumb. it be difficult to plug in another usb device whilst this guy be attach a it take up considerable room. it doe come with an extension cable which doe alleviate this problem, but it's yet another thing you have to carry around. the point of own a flash drive be portability isn't it?

 i do love him.""just... no.look.  the idea of imprinting (also known as soul mates) is that you're connected to that person whether you like it or not.  and outside circumstances do mess that up.  in l.j. smith's daughters of darkness, for example, mary-lynnette and ash are soul mates.  throughout the story ash realizes he loves her, but mary-lynnette fights it until the end.  the key different here, though, is that mary-lynnette learns more about ash and comes to appreciate some of his qualities.  that, and there is nothing stronger pulling her away from him.also, in the end, mary-lynnette is still a little frightened of ash and what he's done in the past, and she basically tells him to go away so he can try to redeem himself and she can finish at least high school.  ash tells her he'll come back in a year, and she says, ""that may be too soon,"" and ash simply says, ""i know.  i'll come back anyway.""basically, l.j. smith acknowledged that as they were, it couldn't work out--both ash and mary-lynnette had to work out their own lives, first.stephenie meyer, in eclipse, had me all set and thinking jacob was like bella's brother, and then out of nowhere it's, ""i love him, too.""  yes, she slightly redeems it with, ""i love edward more,"" but it was still unexplained, out of nowhere, and created angst where there shouldn't have been.  it was much more interesting when jacob was stubborn and bella already knew where her life was going.  screwing it up like that just felt like she wanted to get some of her own fantasies into the book, belatedly, or that she wanted to appease some fans somewhere, or leave it open.and it wouldn't have been a bad idea... if her backstory for them in twilight and new moon hadn't been so solid.i will say, however, that edward's growth of character was a pleasure.  i did enjoy that.the only problem is, i'm wary of picking up meyer's new adult book when it comes out next year.  i was all set to, but that major flaw just... i dunno.  it left a sour taste in my mouth, especially since i'd been admiring her foreshadowing and plot twists and originality so much.","i hate it when one little detail can ruin an entire book for me.**spoilers ahead**i still love twilight and new moon. and the first half of eclipse be good.and i also must say i have nothing against jacob. he annoy me with some stupid, selfish, twist thing he does, but he's still an interest character. and in the end, he get what he know wa coming, so i'm good with that.i'm sorry, but bella's sudden realization of, ""oh yeah, i love jacob, too,"" just doesn't fly with me.if i read right, it's an interest concept--i think meyer wa hint that bella and jacob be imprinted, but edward's existence mess that up, and bella's tug for him be stronger (maybe they be mean to be imprint in a past life, but his be a vampire ruin it somehow, i don't know). and in the end, bella go with the guy she already know she couldn't live without, despite jacob say edward wa her drug, but he would be her sun and air.but meyer really mess it up. in the first two books, and most of the third, jacob be a clear-cut, define family member to her. no hint at other feel whatsoever. then when jacob kiss her and interpret her try to hurt him wrongly, and deepen the kiss, and bella suddenly give in and thinks, ""oh!

1,"i previously had a linksys wrt54g and was moderately satisfied with it until it started exhibiting signs of 'cheapness', like general flakiness, inability to load the web management (it'd load a blank screen), etc.  after getting frustrated enough, and desiring a router with gigabit ports, i started searching, until i came across the dir-655.the first best part (and there's more than one) of this router was unpacking it.  honestly, it's the sexiest networking device i've seen in a long while.  there's a button hiding stealthily on the right side, if you take note, but no mention is made of it in the manual.  also included in the package is a little black plastic stand, so you can stand the router on end - that's pretty standard for d-link, and i like that.  they threw in a cat-5 cable, was that a joke?  what am i going to do with a cat-5 cable on a gigabit router?  that's very amusing.i elected not to run the software included on the cd.  there's no real need if you know what you're doing.  however, for more advanced users i'd recommend connecting the router to your computer, but not connecting to your internet connection (cable modem), and just spending a few minutes familiarizing yourself with your new sweet toy and all of her options.now for the good stuff:  this router is amazing!  the main 'setup' page is basically divided into 2 parts for each section, a 'wizard' for quick-and-easy setup, and a 'manual' page.  basically, if you're a beginner, stick to the wizard pages.  if you wanna get up and running fast, go through the wizards, you can always go back later and manually tweak the settings to your liking.connectivity is top level.  i tested it by transferring 25 gb of large files then 25gb of small files between two hosts connected to this router, both using 10 feet of cat6 each.  100% success, no packets lost, no fragmentation, and the transfer was about 4% faster than the same transfer straight through on an unmanaged gigabit switch.  internet connectivity was great too.  thanks to the built-in spi firewall, all the 'network noise' (thanks to all the other 'dirty' hosts on comcast's network) is effectively eliminated, and honestly speeds up my internet activity significantly over what i'm used to when using the wrt54g.  checking the logs revealed the dirty details of all this crap that's filtered out, and i like it gone.wireless-n connectivity was also good.  not much can be said here, it works like it should, and i have no complaints.administration is also very nice.  as usual, the router is administered via browser, and while that's cool, i'd also like to be able to ssh into it and take care of business via cli, but alas that is not to be.  but otherwise, the web management is well designed, fast and easy to understand.  this router also checks periodically for firmware updates and notifies you via email if you have the email settings enabled.other items of note: voip works flawlessly, as does all online gaming that i tried.  latency is noticeably reduced (on my favorite server, from about 80ms to about 60ms avg) in half-life 2 deathmatch.  torrents worked fine.  so far i have no real complaints about this router.  it's now my most favorite part of my network.overall, i give this 5/5.  honestly, i'd easily say it's worth the price i paid for it (at the time it was $140), and for my network it is a perfect match.  if you're a 'normal' computer user, don't buy this just to impress your friends; the features and complexity would be lost on you and are not worth the price.pros:-dhcp address reservation-easy administration-quick setup-email logs-incredibly easy port forwarding and per-application settings-spi + nat + wpa2.  nuff said.-great documentation and help files.-port forwarding scheduling.cons:-no ssh or cli administration.-reboot required after changing most settings.-no matching high quality d-link cable modem to go with this.congratulations, d-link, on crafting yet another incredible piece of networking equipment.  the dir-655 is worthy enough to sit on my desk, instead of crammed behind it like the linksys was!","i previously have a linksys wrt54g and wa moderately satisfy with it until it start exhibit sign of 'cheapness', like general flakiness, inability to load the web management (it'd load a blank screen), etc. after get frustrate enough, and desire a router with gigabit ports, i start searching, until i come across the dir-655.the first best part (and there's more than one) of this router wa unpack it. honestly, it's the sexiest network device i've see in a long while. there's a button hide stealthily on the right side, if you take note, but no mention be make of it in the manual. also include in the package be a little black plastic stand, so you can stand the router on end - that's pretty standard for d-link, and i like that. they throw in a cat-5 cable, wa that a joke?

0,"just got the griddler (gr-4) for christmas, and have been putting it through some test runs.  the heating is too inconsistent due to several design flaws. these flaws are too significant for me, and i do not recommend this product. i am surprised by these design flaws, as i expected a high quality product, since this carries the ""cuisinart"" name.first, the plates do not have enough mass to maintain heat. the griddle plates each weigh about 18 ounces; while the grill plates weighed 22 ounces. for comparison, i have a waffle iron with removable plates (waffle side and flat griddle side) that weigh 26 ounces, but are 10-15% smaller than the griddler's plates.second, the mass of the plates would not be as big as a concern if the heating element was more constantly ""on."" when the griddler is ready (green light is on); the heating element turns off. the heating element does not turn on again for some time (a few to a several minutes, depending on the temperature and mass of the food being cooked).  in other words, this is like cooking on a frying pan that is heated to a certain temperature, then the pan is removed from the heat, and then the food is added to the pan. after a couple minutes, the pan is placed back on the heat source until it reaches the certain temperature. this type of on-and-off heating is fine for baking in an oven but not for a grill or griddle.third, the heating elements are insufficient. the elements are located in a single rectangular pattern, closer to the outside of the plates, than the inside. this flaw, along with the insufficient mass of the plates, causes food(or parts of such food) placed in the center of the griddler to be less cooked than the outside edges. this is best shown when using the griddler as a griddle and cooking large pancakes. the part of the pancake that was on the outside edge will be golden brown, while the part that was on the inner portion of the plate will be white. a larger heating element that snaked or coiled below the plates (instead of just a rectangular pattern) would sufficiently help with more even cooking of food.fourth, i found the temperature controls to be too low for cooking. even at the highest setting for the griddle, pancakes would get barely golden brown. they would get done, but the color   (along with the inconsistent browning) would not make the pancakes presentable for a meal with guests.these flaws do affect other foods, not just pancakes. for example, when i tried grilling a simple panini sandwich (hot ham and cheese sandwich), the coloration and grill marks were too inconsistent (yet the ham was hot and the cheese was melted). the flaws may be less noticeable in grilling some foods, such as hamburger patties or hotdogs, where the food is usually flipped 2-3 times.in conclusion, the heating-related design flaws make this product not worth purchasing, especially if you are looking to use the product as griddle, or if ""presentation"" (e.g., color of food) is important to you. the griddler may be a decent contact grill, but the uneven cooking is a deal-breaker for me. as of now, i will probably purchase a stove-top, cast iron, panini press to use instead of an electric panini grill.","just get the griddler (gr-4) for christmas, and have be put it through some test runs. the heat be too inconsistent due to several design flaws. these flaw be too significant for me, and i do not recommend this product. i be surprise by these design flaws, a i expect a high quality product, since this carry the ""cuisinart"" name.first, the plate do not have enough mass to maintain heat. the griddle plate each weigh about 18 ounces;

1,"i'd been waiting for these laptops since the introduction of intel processors in macs.  the macbook pros used nearly the exact same case design for far too long.  while i didn't think the macbooks really needed a design refresh, i like the choices apple made so much that i bought one.  i like having a smaller laptop, though i do appreciate some of the additional features you get with a macbook pro.  that said, many of the extra bells and whistles once left out of the macbooks have found their way in and while i never really thought i'd care i have to say--it makes a huge difference.owning a new aluminum macbook is a lot more like owning one of the old 12"" powerbooks.  i used to have one and it was wonderful.  it's probably the one discontinued apple computer that's coveted by its owners.  their resale value is still fairly high, considering how comparatively slow they are.  if you're a blogger or a writer and you don't use the machine for much else, it's sort of a best of breed.  however, with these new aluminum macbooks i think things have changed.  you get a backlit keyboard in the higher end model (which is the one i'm reviewing), an aluminum body (of course), and a multitouch trackpad.  i think the backlit keyboard is the nicest addition.  it's really something you appreciate more once you've used it.  i've never had any difficulty typing in the dark but i can't see myself ever buying a machine without a backlit keyboard again.  it's incredibly helpful when you need to type a special character or press a function button.  if you don't have the usual key positions memorized, i imagine it's even better.  this makes the high end macbook feel a lot more like a macbook pro.regarding the aluminum unibody apple likes to talk about so highly, it's very nice.  while they did this with the macbook air, it seems much more refined with the new macbooks and macbook pros.  my one complaint, which i feel will fade over time, is that it sometimes looks too perfect.  i don't mean this as a backhanded compliment, but that there is such a thing as being so perfect it lacks a human touch.  think about listening to a computer play a song versus a human.  it's just not as good.  well, technically the computer is better but that human touch is relevant to us.  this machine is so exact and precise that it sometimes feels inhuman.  at the same time, it is rather stunning.  i think i'll get past the lack of human imperfections as i get used to looking at it each day.the multitouch trackpad is something i'm not foreign to, as i used a macbook air for awhile.  the new trackpad space is identical.  i found this very fortunate as i don't like buying new machines without being able to get a marware protection pack as well.  luckily i bought a macbook air pack and it fit perfectly.  even the trackpad film fit.  while multitouch gestures didn't make their way into my regular routine too often, i did use them here and there and am glad they now exist throughout apple's line of laptops.  the disadvantage of the new trackpad is the lack of a button.  yes, the whole trackpad is a button and yes it's very clickable.  the problem is that sometimes the click doesn't register.  i turned on single and double taps for left click and right click (respectively), but sometimes those don't register as well.  if this were my first apple laptop, i'd panic and run to the genius bar for help.  since i've been through a few of these, i've found that it takes a month or two before you really break in the button.  i've had the laptop for about ten days now and it's already working better.  still, i wish it just clicked as expected out of the box.  for those that are wondering how you click and drag if there's no actual button, you just kind of pretend there is a button.  while apple gives you the entire trackpad for tracking, and you can click pretty much anywhere (with resistance building more and more as you move upwards), you can expect this trackpad to work just like the macbook air's trackpad.  the space where the air's button would be is where you can safely rest a thumb (or whatever) for clicking.  it will not register as a second finger as easily.  if you pretend there is a button at the bottom of the trackpad, you'll quickly forget there isn't one.but those are the bells and whistles.  as far as performance goes, there's not much excitement in regards to speed.  the computer's architecture has changed, but the core 2 duo processors aren't really much faster (or any faster as the case may be here).  the big jump is in the new graphics processor from nvidia.  i'm not going to pretend to be a hardcore gamer.  i don't play many games, and especially not when it comes to those that are gpu-intensive.  i can't give you frame rates from world of warcraft or anything like that.  what i can tell you is that the new nvidia graphics make for smoother performance around the operating system and seem to contribute to 1) better battery life and 2) a cooler system.one of my favorite things about this laptop is that it doesn't really get hot.  i ran an h.264 video encode today so i could put a video on my iphone and it didn't feel hot at all.  the macbook air heats up in about five seconds and then cripples the gpu first, before throttling anything else, and gets pretty warm.  you could iron a shirt with the old macbooks and i won't even start with the macbook pros.  i can't believe how cool this machine has been.  i'm not punishing it with endless work, but for it to make it through a twelve minute video encode without breaking a sweat is pretty amazing.  it's the first time i've used an apple laptop and didn't worry about becoming sterile.  i don't know what they did, but it's wonderful.i get about four hours of battery life under normal usage.  while this still doesn't quite match what apple promises, it's the highest i've ever, realistically, gotten out of an apple laptop.  i'm more than happy with four hours.  i rarely use my laptop off of the power adapter anyhow.another neat feature of the new macbooks (and macbook pros) is that you can use your iphone/ipod touch stereo headset with microphone to record (crappy) audio and have basic control over itunes.  since i swap my iphone headphones out of the iphone and into the laptop very frequently, this is fantastic.  i can't tell you how many times i've been interrupted and clicked the microphone on the headset to pause the song, only to remember that i can't.  now i can.  this is wonderful.so far i've only had good things to say and that's because, overall, this is an excellent machine.  i want to talk about a few bad things, however.  in my opinion, the biggest flaw is the display.  this is why i've rated it a four and not a five.  the display is an embarrassment.  if you have any intention of doing any visual work that actually matters, this machine will be completely useless to you.  the viewing angle is so terrible that no matter where you are, you will not get even contrast.  i don't notice it quite as much when i'm surfing the web or just writing, but when i watch a video it's very apparent.  if you do visual work and it's not just for fun, do not buy this machine.  get a macbook pro where it's not an issue.  even the old macbooks have better displays.  i don't do visual work on this machine for that reason.  if it's not critical, i might, but for the most part i work on my desktop machine instead.another downside about the display is that it's glossy.  these look cool and all, but the reflections are obnoxious when you can't easily avoid them and you don't get very accurate color or contrast.  this is a fault of the panel itself, too, but the glossiness just ruins it further.  for general use, this isn't a big deal.  if you want to color correct or design, apple has pretty much opted to screw you over regardless of how much you decide to spend on their hardware.  matte screens are just not going to be an option anymore.  i think this is a stupid choice, because the people who kept apple alive are the designers who chose macs early on in apple's history.  the loyalists are generally not fond of glossy screens and have been vocal about it.  i think having an option is fine, but forcing people to use glossy screens is awful.  being a loyalist and needing a matte screen, i've just started using my laptop for everything but color critical work.  it's allowed me to prefer working on a smaller screen, which is nice because it means less computer to cart around.  i've been able to work around this problem, but my situation allowed for it.  it's still a big problem for a lot of people who can't defer to a desktop.the other disadvantage is a lack of firewire.  while i rarely employed firewire in my laptops, especially after using the macbook air (which has none), i still liked having it around.  i don't really miss that it's gone.  again, this is primarily due to having a desktop companion that can connect with just about anything.  whether or not this is a major issue is really up to the individual.  if you know you need it, you have your answer.  personally, i wish apple would've kept it until they had something better to replace it with.  maybe they couldn't fit it into the new, slimmer casing.  i would just like to see a usb 2.0 alternative, since usb 2.0 doesn't quite live up to its claims.when it comes to upgrades and replacements, this machine gets a little better and a little worse.  if you're upgrading from a macbook pro to a macbook pro, you're getting easier upgrades all around.  if you're used to upgrades in a macbook, however, i'd say things are better and worse.  if you want to replace ram, you have to remove the bottom case.  it's not that hard to do but it means keeping track of quite a few screws and exposing the entirety of your machine's innards.  if you're simply replacing the hard drive, however, you can pretty much just yank it out.  one of the first things i did is replace the hard drive with a solid state disk.  they're getting cheaper and you can get a 120gb or 128gb drive for much less than what apple offers.  but on the plus side, if you do want your computer to come with an ssd you now have that option as a custom order.  while in tests ssd hasn't really proven to have too many benefits, in real world practice it makes the machine feel much snappier.  for that reason, having an ssd is worth it.apple's ram upgrade prices are also not as terrible as they used to be.  at least, it seems that way.  a ram upgrade through a third party only saves $10-20.  when spending a lot of money on a new machine, i think many people would choose the convenience over the comparatively small savings that come with doing it yourself.anyway, that pretty much covers the majority of the relevant pros and cons of the new macbook.  so far i love it.  i think it's a wonderfully made machine.  it's sturdy, it's attractive and it works really well.  i've very pleased with it and as long as you can handle the poor display, i highly recommend this macbook.","i'd be wait for these laptop since the introduction

processor from nvidia. i'm not go to pretend to be a hardcore gamer. i don't play many games, and especially not when it come to those that be gpu-intensive. i can't give you frame rate from world of warcraft or anything like that. what i can tell you be that the new nvidia graphic make for smoother performance around the operate system and seem to contribute to 1) better battery life and 2) a cooler system.one of my favorite thing about this laptop be that it doesn't really get hot. i run an h.264 video encode today so i could put a video on my iphone and it didn't feel hot at all. the macbook air heat up in about five second and then cripple the gpu first, before throttle anything else, and get pretty warm. you could iron a shirt with the old macbooks and i won't even start with the macbook pros. i can't believe how cool this machine ha been. i'm not punish it with endless work, but for it to make it through a twelve minute video encode without break a sweat be pretty amazing. it's the first time i've use an apple laptop and didn't worry about become sterile. i don't know what they did, but it's wonderful.i get about four hour of battery life under normal usage. while this still doesn't quite match what apple promises, it's the highest i've ever, realistically, get out of an apple laptop. i'm more than happy with four hours. i rarely use my laptop off of the power adapter anyhow.another neat feature of the new macbooks (and macbook pros) be that you can use your iphone/ipod touch stereo headset with microphone to record (crappy) audio and have basic control over itunes. since i swap my iphone headphone out of the iphone and into the laptop very frequently, this be fantastic. i can't tell you how many time i've be interrupt and click the microphone on the headset to pause the song, only to remember that i can't. now i can. this be wonderful.so far i've only have good thing to say and that's because, overall, this be an excellent machine. i want to talk about a few bad things, however. in my opinion, the biggest flaw be the display. this be why i've rat it a four and not a five. the display be an embarrassment. if you have any intention of do any visual work that actually matters, this machine will be completely useless to you. the view angle be so terrible that no matter where you are, you will not get even contrast. i don't notice it quite a much when i'm surf the web or just writing, but when i watch a video it's very apparent. if you do visual work and it's not just for fun, do not buy this machine. get a macbook pro where it's not an issue. even the old macbooks have better displays. i don't do visual work on this machine for that reason. if it's not critical, i might, but for the most part i work on my desktop machine instead.another downside about the display be that it's glossy. these look cool and all, but the reflection be obnoxious when you can't easily avoid them and you don't get very accurate color or contrast. this be a fault of the panel itself, too, but the glossiness just ruin it further. for general use, this isn't a big deal. if you want to color correct or design, apple ha pretty much opt to screw you over regardless of how much you decide to spend on their hardware. matte screen be just not go to be an option anymore. i think this be a stupid choice, because the people who keep apple alive be the designer who choose mac early on in apple's history. the loyalist be generally not fond of glossy screen and have be vocal about it. i think have an option be fine, but force people to use glossy screen be awful. be a loyalist and need a matte screen, i've just start use my laptop for everything but color critical work. it's allow me to prefer work on a smaller screen, which be nice because it mean le computer to cart around. i've be able to work around this problem, but my situation allow for it. it's still a big problem for a lot of people who can't defer to a desktop.the other disadvantage be a lack of firewire. while i rarely employ firewire in my laptops, especially after use the macbook air (which ha none), i still like have it around. i don't really miss that it's gone. again, this be primarily due to have a desktop companion that can connect with just about anything. whether or not this be a major issue be really up to the individual. if you know you need it, you have your answer. personally, i wish apple would've keep it until they have something better to replace it with. maybe they couldn't fit it into the new, slimmer casing. i would just like to see a usb 2.0 alternative, since usb 2.0 doesn't quite live up to it claims.when it come to upgrade and replacements, this machine get a little better and a little worse. if you're upgrade from a macbook pro to a macbook pro, you're get easier upgrade all around. if you're use to upgrade in a macbook, however, i'd say thing be better and worse. if you want to replace ram, you have to remove the bottom case. it's not that hard to do but it mean keep track of quite a few screw and expose the entirety of your machine's innards. if you're simply replace the hard drive, however, you can pretty much just yank it out. one of the first thing i do be replace the hard drive with a solid state disk. they're get cheaper and you can get a 120gb or 128gb drive for much le than what apple offers. but on the plus side, if you do want your computer to come with an ssd you now have that option a a custom order. while in test ssd hasn't really prove to have too many benefits, in real world practice it make the machine feel much snappier. for that reason, have an ssd be worth it.apple's ram upgrade price be also not a terrible a they use to be. at least, it seem that way. a ram upgrade through a third party only save $10-20. when spend a lot of money on a new machine, i think many people would choose the convenience over the comparatively small save that come with do it yourself.anyway, that pretty much cover the majority of the relevant pro and con of the new macbook. so far i love it. i think it's a wonderfully make machine. it's sturdy, it's attractive and it work really well. i've very please with it and a long a you can handle the poor display, i highly recommend this macbook.",apt boo exact too long thin really need fresh choice small appreciate

0,"my 21 year old daughter bought me the entire set of books.  she is enamored with edward.  i understand.  he's a very compelling character - he's beautiful, perfect, brilliant, protective, inhumanely strong and agile, enigmatic, the ultimate bad-boy with a heart of gold, and he has an amazing backstory and an inhumanly beautiful, loyal and loving adopted family.  i get it - he's every adolescent girl's dream.  and wonder of wonders, he never ages.  the series is more or less about the inexplicable attraction of soul mates, inexplicable because i cannot for the life of me figure out what makes bella attractive aside from the fact that edward can't read her mind and she smells enticing.  perhaps it's my age, but i believe three things - the first is regarding a work of fantasy - an author must stay true to his or her fantasy.  you cannot break the your own rules to give the reader what you think the reader wants.  a fantasy is exactly that, make-believe...a dream, but even so, as a writer you must stay true to the rules you establish for your own fantasy.  ms. meyer breaks her own rules.second, characters must develop and mature.  there must be a larger reason for events in a story and that larger reason cannot simply be so the hero can constantly save the heroine - which is the case here.  it gets very old.  bella does not change and grow.  from beginning to end she remains the same apathetic, cynical, whiny, helpless, martyred female she was when she arrived in forks.  except when she's with edward and then she superglues herself to his side in a manner that seems much more like the way a drug addict needs a fix than true love.  she gets her happy ending but i'm left wondering what she will do with it.  anything redeeming?  i very much doubt it.third, i want my characters fleshed out.  in my opinion, jacob was the most three-dimensional character in the entire series and at times he was written in such a way that he became almost repellent to me.  throughout all four books, the same superficial descriptive words, the same sappy love-sick-puppy feelings that are supposed to pass for mature, timeless love, the same scenes are repeated ad nauseam.  i would have liked to see the cullens, other than carlisle, do more with the their eternal existence than simply repeating experiences and 'hunting'.  oh, and saving bella for some unknown reason.  i assume they became attached to bella because they loved edward and he loved her, so as laurent said to bella in the second book - she was kind of a pet of theirs.  i expect more from my female leads. through four books i wanted bella to mature, to become more 'human' than she was when the series began.  but i'm sorry to say she never did.  edward always seemed more human and more compassionate to me and his character was diminished as the series went on.  if you can get past the flawed writing, the concept works, especially in the first book.  other than jacob black, i was disappointed with the remainder of the story.  vampire world ain't all that exciting.  from what i could tell, their larger society consisted of a bunch of overgrown, temper-tantrum prone, immature, super-powered children (i'm including the ancient vampires with the papery skin) who murder a lot of people.  their rules are simple - keep the secret.  that's it folks.   would it be too much to expect that after living for millennia these vampires might develop some special perspective or philosophy greater  than - we don't eat the neighbors?okay, rant finished.","my 21 year old daughter buy me the entire set of books. she be enamor with edward. i understand. he's a very compel character - he's beautiful, perfect, brilliant, protective, inhumanely strong and agile, enigmatic, the ultimate bad-boy with a heart of gold, and he ha an amaze backstory and an inhumanly beautiful, loyal and love adopt family. i get it - he's every adolescent girl's dream. and wonder of wonders, he never ages. the series be more or le about the inexplicable attraction of soul mates, inexplicable because i cannot for the life of me figure out what make bella attractive aside from the fact that edward can't read her mind and she smell enticing. perhaps it's my age, but i believe three thing - the first be regard a work of fantasy - an author must stay true to his or her fantasy. you cannot break the your own rule to give the reader what you think the reader wants. a fantasy be exactly that, make-believe...a dream, but even so, a a writer you must stay true to the rule you establish for your own fantasy. ms. meyer break her own rules.second, character must develop and mature. there must be a larger reason for event in a story and that larger reason cannot simply be so the hero can constantly save the heroine - which be the case here. it get very old. bella doe not change and grow. from begin to end she remain the same apathetic, cynical, whiny, helpless, martyr female she wa when she arrive in forks. except when she's with edward and then she superglues herself to his side in a manner that seem much more like the way a drug addict need a fix than true love. she get her happy end but i'm leave wonder what she will do with it. anything redeeming?

1,"i've been a logitech gaming-mouse user/lover for a long time. in fact, the last four mice i've used with my gaming rig have been the mx510 (blue), mx518, g5 (1st version) and now the g9.the g9 is the perfect combination of the old g5 (precision, accuracy and on-the-fly resolution adjustments) and the mx revolution (with that killer mouse wheel), stuffed into in a customizable, comfortable and easy to control form factor.pros:-	i really like the new weight style much better than the g5. the weight ""tray"" is hidden under the grip so there is no way it can just pop out like on the previous generation mouse. for me, a properly weighted mouse is key in fps. too light and you are all over the screen. too heavy and you are too late. -	not only can you change the weights, but you can also change the grips to suit your playing style and the color of the led indicators. i prefer the wide load grip for my big hands and the blue leds to match my microsoft reclusa gaming keyboard (black). -	as long as you are a ""righty"", it's very comfortable, even after some marathoning. like all previous logitech mice i've owned, ergonomics and comfort are never lost in the design. -	another great addition is the ability to save up to 5 profiles to the mouse's internal memory. no drivers or software needed to load up your custom mouse settings. there is a switch on the bottom that lets you toggle through your profiles. perfect for lan parties when you might not be gaming on your own rig. -	scrolling with the micro gear is a blast when not gaming. there is a switch under the mouse that lets you toggle between what i call the ""click"" mode (a must for weapon changing in fps) and the ""scroll"" mode (a must for scrolling web pages and long documents).-	the gaming-feet surface is much improved. i use this mouse with a steelseries steelpad qck+ mouse pad and it is smooth as butter. i eventually plan on moving to a solid surface pad as i've heard they can improve accuracy with less friction.-	there are two thumb buttons on the left side. i know this was added to newer model g5 (my older version didn't have this) and it's a warm welcome. these are a must for forward/back functionality when you browse the web.cons:-	the setpoint software is a little flaky. i chalk this up to being an early release. it took a couple reinstalls to finally get it to work correctly. its possible previous software versions on my pc caused this issue. everything works now. -	i can't use my wrist pad with this mouse. i know it sounds weird, but the back of the mouse isn't as long as the g5 and it slopes downward in a way that forces your wrist to touch your mouse pad. because of this, it works best without an elevated wrist pad behind it. if you do try to elevate your wrist/forearm, it can be pretty uncomfortable. no biggie, i'll make due.- $100 price. ouch, but i've gotta have the latest and greatest.so there you have it. i'll update this review as i put it through more testing. be sure to check out the customer photos section. i took some photos of the g9 side-by-side with my old g5. enjoy!","i've be a logitech gaming-mouse user/lover for a long time. in fact, the last four mouse i've use with my game rig have be the mx510 (blue), mx518, g5 (1st version) and now the g9.the g9 be the perfect combination of the old g5 (precision, accuracy and on-the-fly resolution adjustments) and the mx revolution (with that killer mouse wheel), stuff into in a customizable, comfortable and easy to control form factor.pros:- i really like the new weight style much better than the g5. the weight ""tray"" be hide under the grip so there be no way it can just pop out like on the previous generation mouse. for me, a properly weight mouse be key in fps. too light and you be all over the screen. too heavy and you be too late. -

0,"lacie mkes a great product, but packaged with poor software, minimal instructions and hardware/software that ultimately did not work was a killer for this product. i was looking for an external hard drive that i could keep at home and access over the internet. i have an apple airport extreme and an imac of which the ""ethernet disk mini home edition"" was connected to the extreme via gb ethernet. so far so good. after the software failed to recognize the existence of the newly installed hard drive for about 3 attempts, it all of a sudden recognized it. yeah, great, now let's get this thing running.the skimpy instructions comprised about 10% of what i had to dig up on the internet to even get close to getting this thing to work. after a couple of hours, opening up several ports, and entering a bunch of poorly documented parameters into lacie's host site, it finally, sort of worked.every time i got into the lacie home drive with my macbook pro, i would have to log in. not a problem. very slow data transfers, but it did actually limp along with the imac in sleep mode. the problem started with the inconvenience of having to log in from my local imac to access the local lacie home drive. not just once, but for each and every folder on the drive. nuts! again there was extremely slow data transfer rates.next i decided to change some of the security setups, like a different password. fine, except the lame software again failed to recognize the existence of the hard drive. forevermore the drive couldn't be seen by their own software. then after too many futile attempts to get their software to work, the imac eventually couldn't log into the hard drive.keep in mind, that everything in the initial setup was painfully slow too. each individual parameter gets written to the drive one parameter at a time. first comes the password - and it takes 10 minutes? next parameter - and it takes another 10 minutes? come on guys. hello! it's right over here! setup took about 7 to 8 hours - full of frustration as you could imagine.the answer to remote data access by several computers of the mac variety is to open a "".mac"" account. .mac is fast, well behaved, packed with tons of features that are simple to set up and use, and it's convenient. if you love your mac and leopard, you will love setting up .mac (about 15 minutes for the pair of mac's) and using it's rich features.the other lacie hard drives are fast and reliable and have always been a favorite of mine, but this one is rendered into a dumb brick by extremely poor and incomplete software, questionable hardware, and a frustratingly difficult user interface when it decides to limp along on its terms.i may have gotten a lemon, but there are too many things going on here and should be a warning for consumers to look elsewhere.","lacie mkes a great product, but package with poor software, minimal instruction and hardware/software that ultimately do not work wa a killer for this product. i wa look for an external hard drive that i could keep at home and access over the internet. i have an apple airport extreme and an imac of which the ""ethernet disk mini home edition"" wa connect to the extreme via gb ethernet. so far so good. after the software fail to recognize the existence of the newly instal hard drive for about 3 attempts, it all of a sudden recognize it. yeah, great, now let's get this thing running.the skimpy instruction comprise about 10% of what i have to dig up on the internet to even get close to get this thing to work. after a couple of hours, open up several ports, and enter a bunch of poorly document parameter into lacie's host site, it finally, sort of worked.every time i get into the lacie home drive with my macbook pro, i would have to log in. not a problem. very slow data transfers, but it do actually limp along with the imac in sleep mode. the problem start with the inconvenience of have to log in from my local imac to access the local lacie home drive. not just once, but for each and every folder on the drive. nuts! again there wa extremely slow data transfer rates.next i decide to change some of the security setups, like a different password. fine, except the lame software again fail to recognize the existence of the hard drive. forevermore the drive couldn't be see by their own software. then after too many futile attempt to get their software to work, the imac eventually couldn't log into the hard drive.keep in mind, that everything in the initial setup wa painfully slow too. each individual parameter get write to the drive one parameter at a time. first come the password - and it take 10 minutes?

1,"this is my first hd camcorder. i spent months researching and debating the merits of mindv versus avc-hd. i decided to go with tape due to the ease of editing, easy storage, low price of the tapes, and compatibility with imovie '09. i have not been disappointed. after a few weeks of experimenting it is easy to master all of the controls. many have commented on the flimsy feeling of the housing for the cassette. while it's true that the outer shell of the tape deck moves a little it will hardly be noticed after a few days of use. the outer shell really just serves a protective function and is not directly attached to the tape unit itself. also, when you have your hand around it through the strap you can grap the main part of the camera with your fingertips  essentially holding the tape deck tight. it's not a problem at all (although i don't know why they couldn't just make it feel a little sturdier). a couple of points. i bought the dm-50 mic. i'm a wannabe ""prosumer"" and maybe that's why i can't tell the difference but i don't think the mic has really enhanced my videos much, not for $150 anyway. a lot of people have complained about the clicking of the function and menu buttons. this can be a problem. the function button makes a loud click when your press it in the center to open the menu. it is possible to be gentle with the side to side and up/down clicks. this is one case where the dm-50 accessory mic has helped. i find that if i'm careful, i can change settings while recording (mic level, exposure) without the mic picking up the noise. the buzz of the tape itself is essentially completely eliminated. overall, very very quiet. i mention this because this was a key concern i had. i have a sony dvd camcorder and the noise from the dvd spinning and recording is unbearable. i didn't want to spend money on an hd recorder and experience the same thing. it's hard to hit the menu button with my thumb while holding the camcorder. that's not too much of a problem because you can't use the menu function while recording anyway. the view finder does not adjust as mentioned in other reviews. i never use the view finder anyway so it's not a problem for me.  the life of the included battery is not long so buy another one. also, unlike a canon rebel camera, it does not come with an external charger for the battery. those can be quite expensive, even on amazon. if you are a beginner like me an want to transfer video immediately you have to buy a firewire cable. i didn't have one and was so eager to upload video i had to go to best buy and drop over $30 on a 6 pin firewire cable. save yourself some frustration and money and buy one off amazon for half the price at the same time you buy your camera. the widest angle setting is not that wide. i'm going to buy the canon wide-angle lens soon. i think this is probably the case for any camcorder. so, for someone who just entered the hdv market i am extremely pleased with this purchase. it is easy  to use with my mac and imovie. i think it feels sturdy. it is pretty daggon quiet. and the picture is just unbelievable. the media is perfect for me. i got what i wanted.","this be my first hd

0,"two years ago, like many users here i jumped over from quicken on the pc to quicken mac... hoping that it would work as well. my wife and i loved the mac but struggled with quicken each week to reconcile our very simple checking and savings accounts from our credit union. we hoped that we would just get better at living with its quirks or that its quirks would get ironed out in updates. neither ended up happening. i wouldn't say that we do any kind of advanced accounting at all. very simple, straightforward downloading/matching of transactions, trying to monitor a budget, etc. i cannot imagine how we made it through nearly 2 years of using quicken for mac without going completely crazy!we finally had enough when quicken started losing transactions that were downloaded from our bank. one moment my paycheck would be there and downloaded, then we'd go look for it in the register... gone. wtf?!? how does a program like this lose a transaction. it happened 3 times and that was it. i searched for new mac finance software and thank goodness we found moneydance. i'd looked at it several months ago but it didn't really look all that great. but after actually buying it and using it we're totally hooked! it is so much better than quicken in so many ways it's hard to address everything here. first there's the matching of transactions. to be honest, my real favorite finance software on the pc was microsoft money which imported online banking transactions more accurately with fewer false-matches than quicken pc ever did. still, it's hard to imagine any program that is more inept at guessing transaction matches than quicken mac. that's the first big problem.moneydance excels at transaction matching. all fields auto-complete as if psychic. if you need to change something, it's very simple and intuitive and it remembers that change for the next time that type of transaction comes up. advantage: moneydancesecond, there is no easy way to sort transactions by cleared/uncleared in quicken. a completely ridiculous oversight. all i want to do is download my online transactions and update my own record comparing it to what the bank shows... then see a total of cleared vs. uncleared. in quicken, uncleared transactions can only be viewed by running some complicated, customized report. why not a simple column sorting capability? this is a no-brainer and moneydance allows sorting by any column - date, check number, payee, amount, cleared transactions. advantage: moneydance. in fact, moneydance has a drop-down display with four $ amounts for your checkbook register: ledger (your true checkbook balance), cleared (what has cleared from the bank), bank's balance (what your bank actually showed as balance), and current balance (accounting for anything that is pending on the next business day). it works so well that we don't even have to 'balance' our accounts monthly any more. our accounts are balanced each and every day when we download new transactions. we're able to verify easily all outstanding checks by simply sorting the register by what is cleared - which is so far ahead of quicken it's just insane. to see your bank's balance in quicken you have to go back into the download transactions window.third, budgeting features on quicken are hopelessly complex to setup. this shouldn't be so amazingly difficult. it's addition and subtraction. in moneydance you just setup your categories, make a new budget and add the items/amounts in the list. moneydance even has a bar graph at the top of your account view that shows where your budget income/expenses level is currently.fourth, overall software layout and interface. quicken looks pretty at first until you start trying to use it. any toolbar button you push opens another little window. great if you have a huge monitor where you can spread all of them out but really useless on normal screens. moneydance mostly consolodates functions into one changing window. advantage: moneydance.fifth, transaction searching. hello intuit, this is a mac. it has something called 'spotlight' search that's been around for several years now. moneydance has a spotlight-type search built right into the top of the register. looking for a specific transaction? just try typing it in the search bar and the as-you-type list populates with matching results. crazy-easy. advantage: moneydance.so my recommendation is to take a look at moneydance and steer clear of quicken mac. no amount of refinement on the pc side has made it over to the mac version. you will hate this program. it will cause you problems! stay away!!!","two year ago, like many user here i jump over from quicken on the pc to quicken mac... hop that it would work a well. my wife and i love the mac but struggle with quicken each week to reconcile our very simple check and save account from our credit union. we hop that we would just get better at live with it quirk or that it quirk would get iron out in updates. neither end up happening. i wouldn't say that we do any kind of advance account at all. very simple, straightforward downloading/matching of transactions, try to monitor a budget, etc. i cannot imagine how we make it through nearly 2 year of use quicken for mac without go completely crazy!we finally have enough when quicken start lose transaction that be download from our bank. one moment my paycheck would be there and downloaded, then we'd go look for it in the register... gone. wtf?!?

1,"overall, i am satisfied with this coffee maker.  for starters, the coffee it makes is delicious.  i have been using a french press for the last 5 years, and was weary about buying an auto-drip brewer, but i was not disappointed.  the first batch of coffee turned out rich and hot.  it is also aesthetically pleasing to look at.  i like the simplistic toggle controls and dials.  however, it is not very ergonomic.  the water bin is right up next to the filter.  it's hard to pour water into the bin without spilling it into the filter.  i have learned to pour it without splashing it, but there should be some sort of separator or conduit that assists in the pouring operation.  also, the measurement indicators are inside the bin, and are impossible to read, so it's a good idea to measure the water before you pour it in.instead of a glass carafe and a heating element, i wish it had a stainless steel carafe.  that way, i could just have it turn off right when i am done brewing and then keep the coffee warm for hours.   on this machine, if you want warm coffee, you have to keep the heating element on.","overall, i be satisfy with this coffee maker. for starters, the coffee it make be delicious. i have be use a french press for the last 5 years, and wa weary about buy an auto-drip brewer, but i wa not disappointed. the first batch of coffee turn out rich and hot. it be also aesthetically please to look at. i like the simplistic toggle control and dials. however, it be not very ergonomic. the water bin be right up next to the filter. it's hard to pour water into the bin without spill it into the filter. i have learn to pour it without splash it, but there should be some sort of separator or conduit that assist in the pour operation. also, the measurement indicator be inside the bin, and be impossible to read, so it's a good idea to measure the water before you pour it in.instead of a glass carafe and a heat element, i wish it have a stainless steel carafe. that way, i could just have it turn off right when i be do brew and then keep the coffee warm for hours. on this machine, if you want warm coffee, you have to keep the heat element on.",star delicious disappointed first rich hot so aesthetic esthetic like simplistic right hard ill good wish just keep warm want

""new moon"" is like a guilty pleasure.  it's full of fluffy drama and angsty-ness.  admittedly, this appealed to me better three years ago, but it is fun none the less.  will bella and edward end up together?  will edward save the day?  will the cullens return?  we all know the answer, but it's still fun to find out.oh, and enjoy the not-so-subtle ""romeo and juliet"" parallels before they get old and tiresome.  which they do.  quick.","this review be from: new moon (the twilight saga, book 2) (hardcover) to begin, a little description of setting, just to give context. i'm an eighteen year old college fresh(wo)man who wa look for a few good read for winter break. that be said, understand that although i'm a year or two older than the target audience of the twilight series, i'm other wise who the author be write to. like ""twilight,"" ""new moon"" be about the now eighteen year old isabelle ""bella"" swan and her vampire love, edward cullen. however, when he mysterious leaf her - claim to no longer be in love with her - she find herself lose and flailing. fortunately, she find support through jacob ""jake"" black, a native american werewolf a year or two younger than her. together, bella overcome her loss and deal with a new threat around her. one of the thing that bother me about ""twilight"" wa how bella seem to have no hobby or past time interests. which be why the relationship she develop with jacob in ""new moon"" wa really satisfying. in contrast to bella's relationship with edward, her friendship with jacob seem to have serious substance. they have share interests, fear and friends. in contrast, bella's ""friends"" from school be vapid and meaningless figures.on a relate note, ""new moon"" be certainly more involve than ""twilight"" - there's more drama than ""oh-no-i-love-a-vampire."" it's more like ""oh-no-my-vampire-love-has- abandoned-me-and-now-i-might-love-a-werewolf-but-vampires-are-trying-to-kill-me-crud."" you can see the add dynamic. another sort of petty thing that bother me wa stephenie meyer's use of adjective in reference to edward. he wa always describe a ""perfect"" or ""beautiful"" - physical traits. never wa he describe use emotional adjectives, like ""gentle"" or ""loving."" to me, these physical adjective trivialize the quality (and intensity) of edward and bella' relationship. i mean, (since it's from bella's perspective) it seem clear that she only ""loves"" edward for his physical features.i know about of fan like this series because they can place themselves in a bella and pretend that the story be happen to them. i'm not sure how any one can do this, or really want to do this. bella be a hugely dependant and unstable character. she's weak emotionally and occasionally whiny. but still, some how, i'm draw to her personality. maybe it's just because i wonder what stupid thing she'll do next...which, i suppose, blend into another problem i have with ""new moon"" - and the entire series in general (though i have not yet read eclipse). bella's personality be severely lacking. she life for and through edward - so when he leaf her, she be nothing. eventually, he returns, but doe she learn her lesson? no. she continue to be a dependant a possible. a a feminist, i'm a little ashamed of myself for like these books. bella represent the typical ""damsel in distress"" who rely only on the male figure in her life for support and survival.

1,"i was almost put off by the price of this unit, but i took the plunge and bought it and i'm glad i did. it makes perfect coffe every time, and has the flexibility to produce exactly the cup of coffee you want at any given time. those who say the coffee is too weak don't understand how to use the machine [see my recommendations below] and those who say it's too noisy haven't placed it properly. the pump does make a bit of sound but if you isolate the unit from hard surfaces, with underpadding for example, the noise is tamed considerably.about the strength of the coffee: it helps to understand that the k-cups themselves are portioned for a standard 6-oz coffee cup. most people do not actually use 6-oz cups and have never made a standard measure cup of coffee. i hadn't either until i got this machine. now i understand. if you use a 12-oz cup, you need 2 k-cups and two shots of water at 6 ounces each. not cheap, but sure is good. you can adjust strength for taste by adjusting the amount of water. one of my sisters likes it a little weaker than standard, so she uses a single 10-oz shot of water. comes out perfect for her. my son likes it strong, so he uses bold k-cups, one with a 6-oz shot and one with an 8-oz shot of water to make his morning coffee. i like mine kind of medium, so i use two regular k-cups (not bold), one full-caf with 6 oz and one decaf with 6 oz and i'm all set. great coffee. you can make it any way you want from standard coffee cup to travel mug. don't try to make a full travel mug with one k-cup unless you like it weak. one friend of mine likes it that way, though, so there really is a recipe for everyone.let's face it, k-cups are not cheap coffee for home brew, though it is more than competitive with barista-served boutique coffee and every bit as good. but for those who can't get past the price of the k-cups, there's is a very clever little contraption, easy to use, that lets you use whatever coffee in whatever portion you like! what could be more flexible? even with the little contraption, making coffee with this machine is much easier and tidier than using any kind of coffee pot, and the results are fantastic.i agree with the spring water recommendation unless you are lucky to live in a place where the water is additive free with no taste of its own. i buy store brand spring water by the case. it's worth it for the quality of the final product. if you care about good coffee, go the extra distance. if you use the little brew contraption that lets you use your own coffee, then the little extra cost for spring water, which you should be using anyway, isn't really a burden. if you pony up for this appliance, you probably don't care all that much about the price of coffee per cup. besides, if you buy coffee out, this is less expensive even with two k-cups per serving and spring water. all that doesn't come to $1.39, so there's really nothing to complain about.this is not to say the machine is perfect in every way. probably no machine is perfect in every way. it could be quieter. the reservoir could be larger. the control panel could have more buttons and adjustments, although i don't see how that really would be an improvement. you can adjust the water temp and the shot size, so what else do you really need? get it, brew up some fine coffee and enjoy. it's quick and easy and very neat and clean. if you love coffee, you won't be sorry you got this machine. enough said.","i wa almost put off by the price of this unit, but i take the plunge and buy it and i'm glad i did. it make perfect coffe every time, and ha the flexibility to produce exactly the cup of coffee you want at any give time. those who say the coffee be too weak don't understand how to use the machine [see my recommendation below] and those who say it's too noisy haven't place it properly. the pump doe make a bite of sound but if you isolate the unit from hard surfaces, with underpadding for example, the noise be tame considerably.about the strength of the coffee: it help to understand that the k-cups themselves be portion for a standard 6-oz coffee cup. most people do not actually use 6-oz cup and have never make a standard measure cup of coffee. i hadn't either until i get this machine. now i understand. if you use a 12-oz cup, you need 2 k-cups and two shoot of water at 6 ounce each. not cheap, but sure be good. you can adjust strength for taste by adjust the amount of water. one of my sister like it a little weaker than standard, so she us a single 10-oz shoot of water. come out perfect for her. my son like it strong, so he us bold k-cups, one with a 6-oz shoot and one with an 8-oz shoot of water to make his morning coffee. i like mine kind of medium, so i use two regular k-cups (not bold), one full-caf with 6 oz and one decaf with 6 oz and i'm all set. great coffee. you can make it any way you want from standard coffee cup to travel mug. don't try to make a full travel mug with one k-cup unless you like it weak. one friend of mine like it that way, though, so there really be a recipe for everyone.let's face it, k-cups be not cheap coffee for home brew, though it be more than competitive with barista-served boutique coffee and every bite a good. but for those who can't get past the price of the k-cups, there's be a very clever little contraption, easy to use, that let you use whatever coffee in whatever portion you like! what could be more flexible?

1,"this review is from: gone with the wind (four-disc collector's edition) 1939 (dvd)      this movie is a historical film on many levels. it excellently portrays the old south, a civilization ""gone with the wind."" it seemlessly adapts the rather long margaret mitchell best seller onto the screen. it won a historic eight oscars including the first to a black actor (hattie mcdaniel). and aside from all of these things, it is a highly entertaining film.for those who are unfamiliar with the story, i just recommend seeing the film. it has a little bit of everything, though it is certainly heavy on the sentiment. it is, after all, an homage to the glory of the old south. scarlett o'hara (vivien leigh) is a rather flirtatious girl who finds herself insanely jealous when she finds out that ashley wilkes (leslie howard) is to marry his cousin melanie hamilton (olivia de havilland). suddenly, the south enters a war with the north and the world becomes chaotic. a scoundrel from charleston named rhett butler (clark gable) is a constant companion to scarlett though she treats him badly. it is obvious that he loves her, but she is too enraptured with ashley. battling poverty and responsibility when she aches for the life of luxury she led before the war, scarlett strives for happiness when everyone else has lost their strength.there are many gorgeous scenes in the movie; each scene stands out as a work of art. who could forget the simplicity of the women strolling down the grand staircase at the wilkes' barbeque? or what about eric linden's heartwrenching screams as he fights to keep his leg? what a powerful statement the field of wounded and dying soldiers makes as the torn confederate flag weakly waves in the breeze! and who is not jarred by the impact of the red sky against the hopelessness of the war torn fields of georgia? scene after scene cements itself into the unconscious and becomes more powerful with each viewing.there are many interesting behind-the-scenes stories to be told about the film, many of which are included in the 1989 documentary included on disk three. most interesting about this piece is perhaps the audition footage with some of the top names in hollywood. also on this disk are features about the restoration of the film and footage of the premieres. disk four is essential for fans of the stars of the golden age of hollywood. we see a recently recorded bit with de havilland where she relays memories of the making of gone with the wind. it is always interesting to hear firsthand information. the gable documentary is not wonderful, but it does include memories from a longtime friend. leigh's tribute is a bit better, and includes many clips arranged artistically for an emotional impact.","this review be from: go with the wind (four-disc collector's edition) 1939 (dvd) this movie be a historical film on many levels. it excellently portray the old south, a civilization ""gone with the wind."" it seemlessly adapt the rather long margaret mitchell best seller onto the screen. it win a historic eight oscar include the first to a black actor (hattie mcdaniel). and aside from all of these things, it be a highly entertain film.for those who be unfamiliar with the story, i just recommend see the film. it ha a little bite of everything, though it be certainly heavy on the sentiment. it is, after all, an homage to the glory of the old south. scarlett o'hara (vivien leigh) be a rather flirtatious girl who find herself insanely jealous when she find out that ashley wilkes (leslie howard) be to marry his cousin melanie hamilton (olivia de havilland). suddenly, the south enter a war with the north and the world become chaotic. a scoundrel from charleston name rhett butler (clark gable) be a constant companion to scarlett though she treat him badly. it be obvious that he love her, but she be too enrapture with ashley. battle poverty and responsibility when she ache for the life of luxury she lead before the war, scarlett strive for happiness when everyone else ha lose their strength.there be many gorgeous scene in the movie; each scene stand out a a work of art. who could forget the simplicity of the woman stroll down the grand staircase at the wilkes' barbeque?

1,"as for the cuisinart gr-4 griddler, the first one i received was defective (more on that at the end of this review). the replacement product i received works fine.  the griddler is very stylish-looking with brushed stainless steel and ""retro"" styled knobs.  the top of the unit gets very hot during cooking and should not be touched without a protective mitt.  it takes several minutes to heat up, no matter what temperature you select, which i found a bit surprising.  it also takes a very long time for the unit to cool down once you are finished cooking.  it helps to leave the unit in the open position for faster cooling, but you can plan on waiting at least 30-60 minutes for it to cool down to where you can safely clean it.  a light on the grill/griddle selector knob turns red when the unit is switched on, and a separate light on the temperature knob turns green to indicate when the desired temperature is reached.  the product works as advertised.  it can be used as a panini press or opened flat for a two-section open-faced griddle.  there are two sets of metal plates that come with the griddler - a flat set and a set with ridges.  they are coated with non-stick material and therefore only plastic or nylon utensils should be used with the griddler to avoid scratching the plates.  the plates are easily interchanged and washed.  they are also dishwasher-safe.  you don't want to break or lose them - they cost $30 each to replace on cuisinart's web site.  there are two cheap plastic collection cups that can be placed at the corner of the griddle to collect grease.  they are quite small, and do not hold much.  a cheap plastic cleaning tool is also provided to help clean the grill plates.  i have not needed to use it.  overall, i am happy with the griddler.  i paid $109.95 for it, which i believe is a good value.  it would be over-priced at the $199 suggested retail price.  cuisinart's quality control and customer service with this product was surprisingly poor.  before having to return the defective unit i tried to get a replacement manual from cuisinart.  they promised to send one in 7-10 days which never arrived.  that's the only reason i docked the griddler a star.speaking of poor customer service, my first griddler arrived from amazon.com in an open shipping carton with the flaps loosely closed rather than taped shut.  the manufacturer's box for the griddler, however, appeared to be unopened.  nonetheless, the product arrived with no instruction manual or registration material, and one of the switches on the front of the product was loose and sparked when the unit was plugged in.  i returned the product for a replacement.  amazon's customer service is terrible.  there is no telephone number to explain the problem to a customer service rep (i challenge you to find any phone number of this nature on their entire web site).  instead you must request a refund or replacement by email.  they direct you to download a form to cut & paste onto your package to return the product by usps (with no tracking) at no cost.  alternatively, you can elect to send it by other means, although there is no mention of how they will reimburse you for the shipping cost (although they claim they will do so).  since there is no telephone number to call for clarification, i would be very skeptical about it.  i sent my package back by usps, but i have no way to prove it.  a company the size of amazon.com should have far better customer service than this.  they should at least have a phone number you can call about problems with your order.  it is clear they would rather not have to deal with their customers about problems.  having ordered thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from amazon over the years, it has really made me think about ordering anything of major value from them in the future.addendum (3/21/06) - since i wrote this initial review amazon has added a link to contact a customer service representative by telephone.  to access it, click on ""help"" in their main menu and click on the ""ordering"" link.  to the right is a link to request a telephone contact.  i used this link for another order issue, and it worked very well.  the representative called me back immediately.  clearly, amazon has made an effort to improve their customer service.","a for the cuisinart gr-4 griddler, the first one i receive wa defective (more on that at the end of this review). the replacement product i receive work fine. the griddler be very stylish-looking with brush stainless steel and ""retro"" style knobs. the top of the unit get very hot during cook and should not be touch without a protective mitt. it take several minute to heat up, no matter what temperature you select, which i find a bite surprising. it also take a very long time for the unit to cool down once you be finish cooking. it help to leave the unit in the open position for faster cooling, but you can plan on wait at least 30-60 minute for it to cool down to where you can safely clean it. a light on the grill/griddle selector knob turn red when the unit be switch on, and a separate light on the temperature knob turn green to indicate when the desire temperature be reached. the product work a advertised. it can be use a a panini press or open flat for a two-section open-faced griddle. there be two set of metal plate that come with the griddler -

1,"i've been using the braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation. i work in a chemistry lab so anytime i have a device that uses a ""solution"" i try to think how i can mimic it and save money and time. i make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine. shake well before each use. for the braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution. dump the remaining solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get as much of the hair debris out of the container. i use two ingredients in the solution: rubbing alcohol and finger nail polish remover (non-drying lemon scented). the volume of the solution is a little less than 6 ounces, but i make a mark on the side using a sharpie when the container is new, and just fill to that level each time. just add a couple ounces alcohol through the small hole (i got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 ml) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface. you can try to mix or let the shaver mix it when it recirculates. the polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well. use at your own risk.","i've be use the braun 7526 shaver and clean stand for 5+ years, and have find it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation. i work in a chemistry lab so anytime i have a device that us a ""solution"" i try to think how i can mimic it and save money and time. i make my own aftershave lotion by mix rub alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine. shake well before each use. for the braun clean solution, be aware that the red light come on due to the level drop low; it ha nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution. dump the remain solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get a much of the hair debris out of the container. i use two ingredient in the solution: rub alcohol and finger nail polish remover (non-drying lemon scented). the volume of the solution be a little le than 6 ounces, but i make a mark on the side use a sharpie when the container be new, and just fill to that level each time. just add a couple ounce alcohol through the small hole (i get a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 ml) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark be sure the container be on a level surface. you can try to mix or let the shaver mix it when it recirculates. the polish remover be good at remove the oil leave on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaf a trace of oily ingredient that seem to help lube the shaver a well. use at your own risk.",clean lean stand for best close thin mix want your soft ill well light due level low main rough small dry scented sharp new just able ace good at utter oily
1,"my little asus eee pc1000ha arrived yesterday early afternoon, and i've been on it ever since, doing work and testing its potential.  i'm delighted with it overall--it's no surprise that, as of december 31, 2008, it's sold out at amazon.  i did a huge amount of research on netbooks before purchasing this, and the other amazon reviewers (for all the different netbooks researched) were most helpful. their warning that this is only an atom processor is a good one--this doesn't work as fast as my five year old gateway 200xl (xp pro, centrino processor, 1.6mhz, 512mb ram, 60gb hd), which i just loved until it ran out of hard drive space and could not be upgraded. on the other hand, the eee pc1000ha really is great for internet and word processing--what it is designed to do.  i had to turn off various background-working programs, like webshots and google indexing, but these are still useful, within limits.  don't run an anti-virus scan while working, either. when all the background programs were turned off, internet access, even internet video, was speedy on my wireless connection, with no gaps (or gasps) at all. here's what i really like about this machine:1)  it's pretty quiet--much quieter than the old sony vaio picturebook i used to use.  i'm a student, and the eee pc will not draw the negative attention in a small graduate class the way the sony picturebook did (and so i had to stop using the sony and sell it).2) the screen is clear and the 10.2 inch display is quite adequate.  i don't really miss a bigger screen at all.3)  the keyboard really is do-able (except for that blasted right shift key--it is quite a stretch for my little finger, even with a smaller keyboard).  but that is adjustable, too.  (see previous reviewer regarding downloading free software that allows users to change keys.)4) i can watch my news video clips with no lags at all. 5) battery life is great!  it really is 7 hours with (a) lcd lighted display turned down all the way, (b) wireless off.  in other words, if all you have to do is word processing, you can do it.  otherwise, 6 hrs with wireless and lowest light lcd, and 5 hrs with wireless and highest light lcd. 6) the upgradeability is the best on any machine i've ever seen!  not only are the ram and hard drive easily removable and replacable, but so is the wireless adapter!  now that is really cool!  still, i'm quite pleased with the wireless and its speediness.what i don't like:1) i don't like this touchpad so much.  now, don't get me wrong--i prefer touchpads to a mouse, but i really miss the old synaptic touchpads.  i could do all kinds of great things with the synaptic touchpads of the olden days, and all with one finger!  now i have to learn a whole new touchpad sign language, and even then, the touchpad is not as responsive as i'm used to on older laptops. the scrolling, for example, is inconsistent. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. the elantech smart pad is not as easily programmable as the old synaptic touchpad on my gateway 200xl.  what ever happened to synaptic?  why throw away what was great?  on the other hand, this touch pad still does not drive me crazy the way the touchpad does on machines like the hp pavilion 2660se.  so, elantech is a step in the right direction, at least, even if it hasn't gotten as far as what the old synaptic touchpad could do with just one little finger (not two or three).  that said, even when you take the time to learn the new sign language, the elantech touchpad still doesn't scroll as easily as a single quick stroke of my finger used to on the old synaptic. with the elantech, i have to keep stroking the touchpad to scroll--too many movements!2) i don't like the hard drive light under my right wrist--i can't tell if the hard drive is being written to or not.  i like having the hard drive light visible, and this is not positioned well to make it easily seen, unless i stop typing and remove my hand.3) a nice size hard drive...and they partitioned it!  ugh!  forget that they tell you it's 160gb--it's really 80gb on one partition and 61gb on the other.  so their math is off (80+61=141 gbs, not 160).  i have used an old hp nc4000 that does read all 160gb on the hard drive, so i can't figure out why the 1000ha misses 19gb on its hard drive, even with the updated bios. so, for the touchpad, which is less than the old synaptic quality and simplicity, i give this little machine 4 stars, not 5.  but so far, i'm delighted that i got this from amazon before it sold out. amazon's deal was the most affordable option for this model (with these specs for hard drive and battery life), and i looked everywhere, even at best buy. so all in all, this will serve my needs very well and i'm delighted with it.","my little asus eee pc1000ha arrive yesterday early afternoon, and i've be on it ever since, do work and test it potential. i'm delight with it overall--it's no surprise that, a of december 31, 2008, it's sell out at amazon. i do a huge amount of research on netbooks before purchase this, and the other amazon reviewer (for all the different netbooks researched) be most helpful. their warn that this be only an atom processor be a good one--this doesn't work a fast a my five year old gateway 200xl (xp pro, centrino processor, 1.6mhz, 512mb ram, 60gb hd), which i just love until it run out of hard drive space and could not be upgraded. on the other hand, the eee pc1000ha really be great for internet and word processing--what it be design to do. i have to turn off various background-working programs, like webshots and google indexing, but these be still useful, within limits. don't run an anti-virus scan while working, either. when all the background program be turn off, internet access, even internet video, wa speedy on my wireless connection, with no gap (or gasps) at all. here's what i really like about this machine:1) it's pretty quiet--much quieter than the old sony vaio picturebook i use to use. i'm a student, and the eee pc will not draw the negative attention in a small graduate class the way the sony picturebook do (and so i have to stop use the sony and sell it).2) the screen be clear and the 10.2 inch display be quite adequate. i don't really miss a bigger screen at all.3) the keyboard really be do-able (except for that blast right shift key--it be quite a stretch for my little finger, even with a smaller keyboard). but that be adjustable, too.

0,"before i make any purchase i try to look around and find the most affordable and reliable solution. however, i wish i took more care into doing so when researching my external hard drive. lets spill out a little tale.i was recently switching my windows laptop over to a linux build. before doing so i backed up all of my data and client's data onto my 500gb seagate external hard drive. after awhile of fooling around on the distribution and realizing the emulation capabilities were not what i hoped of some windows based programs i switched back. (no hard feelings linux, i still love you and use you in other ventures.) however when i went to plug my seagate hard drive in nothing happened. i went and opened it up and the drive looked like it was completely blank. i unplugged it and switched over to my desktop. this time all the folders were there, but empty. shut everything down checked connections, pins, made sure everything was plugged in and then powered everything on. again, no data was shown.in somewhat of a panic since a clients project was due that week i contacted their customer support, who seems to work more off of sales then to help. while i was on with the representative who took forever to respond between inquiries i started researching seagates data recovery and analysis tools. when i mentioned these to the customer support he said ""do not do anything to your hard drive. shut everything down and do not touch it."" yes, caps. then being told that seagate's ""remote data recovery"" service would cost close to $1400 i promptly left. after searching and trying various options i did eventually get my data off of the hard drive. however it was a daunting task. i would advise anyone, who needs to backup their data to stay away from seagate. i have yet to use any other physical back up solution. i rely heavily on amazon's amazing s3 services. so, buyers, if you happen to be revamping your system and want to buy an external hard drive go ahead, get a seagate. they will only cost you $1500. or, you can try out s3 and pay pennies per month for only the space that you use.","before i make any purchase i try to look around and find the most affordable and reliable solution. however, i wish i take more care into do so when research my external hard drive. let spill out a little tale.i wa recently switch my window laptop over to a linux build. before do so i back up all of my data and client's data onto my 500gb seagate external hard drive. after awhile of fool around on the distribution and realize the emulation capability be not what i hop of some window base program i switch back.

the story was trying to get somewhere, but the going was rough, uncomfortable, and by the ending all i could think of was the word ""unsatisfactory"".in new moon we are tossed into a story of separated lovers, and the book makes no attempt to tone down the obvious allusions to shakespeare.  this is romeo and juliet, edward and bella style.  it gets so heavy handed that in more than a few places bella is actively casting herself, edward and jacob into prominent roles in the play, and edward takes the suicide plot and runs with it far beyond necessary.  i appreciate the attempts by the author to explain just how deep the connection is between bella and edward, but the romeo and juliet plotline is a recycled one at best, and it quickly grows sour when layered so thickly over the narrative.  besides bella and edward's love `til death or suicide drama, jacob black is a revitalizing breath of fresh air.  the newly inherited ability to turn into a werewolf adds jacob in as an interesting dynamic to bella's life (and love life) and i sincerely hope meyer continues to play with the meaning of what jacob is to bella besides a second option to edward.  it would be unfair to cast jacob as a plainly obvious second fiddle to edward when he has so much potential.  as far as bella, while at first her clumsy antics were amusing they also fall flat in new moon.  bella's accidental ability to injure herself flies off the chart in new moon, so much so that i found myself skimming past her new and not so ingenious ways of torturing herself for the fleeting seconds when her subconscious summons up edward's voice in order to tell her how to not act like a clumsy fool.  there had to be a better way of passing her time without edward.  for one: growing up would have suited bella nicely.  she's 18, yet everyone in new moon manages to treat her as either an invalid or an infant, either saving her from herself or actively carting, hauling, or carrying her around.  the moment bella stands up for herself and takes care of herself will be a landmark in this book series, because she spends so much time mourning edward's loss and so much time trying to patch jacob into the holes edward previously filled you must wonder when bella can fix herself rather than relying on her male friends to figure it out for her.  by the end of the book, the nature of bella and edward's relationship changes little. edward comes back, scolds bella for having acted so insane in his absence because of course he loves her, bella is shocked that he does indeed love her (although i thought that was already established, and if not why was he trying to commit suicide if he didn't love her?) and edward's still immaturely gung ho on suicide, no matter bella's say in it.  overall, new moon is a disappointing follow-up.  things felt rushed and ultimately pointless, not to mention the numerous typos found in a first edition copy.  twilight is still a wonderful story, but i can't say that i'm liking where the story is going.","this review be from: new moon (the twilight saga, book 2) (hardcover) i go into new moon want to like it, and in certain section i will admit that i did. naturally i be a fan of meyer's previous book, twilight, and wa expect to see at least a hearty attempt to recreate the magic that twilight spin in excess. new moon revolve like a flat tire;

""holy crow?"" even my grandmother doesn't say that.) or the sometimes over-the-top sappy exposition and dialogue. but i could deal. but this book. it was like watching my childhood stuffed animal get... um, defiled. it was that horrifying. i understand the concept of author's prerogative, but any author has a responsibility to 1) keep leaps of logic to a minimum, which definitely excludes some weird, mutant child of the corn, 2) keep the plots and characters consistent throughout the series within the framework which the author has set up, and 3) follow basic rules of writing and editing a novel designed for an intelligent audience. all 3 of which were shockingly snubbed in breaking dawn. please, please, please. do yourself a favor and stop reading at eclipse, or better yet, at new moon or twilight, and fill in the very few blanks for yourself. i will never criticize an author for having an ambiguous ending again. just click on ""most helpful reviews"" and you will see the many, many people who feel the same way. *spoilers ahead, but you should probably read this part anyway to realize just how awful this book is*here are a few of the many, many problems i have with this book:1) so edward and bella get married and that part's pretty cute, even though i think it would have made more sense to transform her first, since that's how they're planning to spend their marriage. they get married at the very beginning of the book, and bella doesn't even really want to. she agreed because she wants to get laid. wow, warms the heart.then begins the vomit-inducing 700 pages. 2) edward and bella have sex. a lot. effectively ruining the innocence of their cute romance and turning it into some trashy, thinly-veiled-porn novella you buy at the airport. sex is at the very least alluded to in almost every scene they have together. they like it. we get it.but that's not the worst part. even while she is human. um, edward is a creature who literally turns iron into dust and moves as fast as a speeding car without breaking a sweat. and she wants him to have sex with her as she is?! how the hell would that be 1) enjoyable for him, and 2) not life-threatening for her?! not only does bella whine, manipulate, and cry her way into doing this outrageously stupid and selfish thing (totally decimated my respect for her character), but then edward, totally out of character, gives into her crap and agrees to try. try?! why don't i just try to juggle chainsaws?! and for what? so she can get some a little bit ahead of schedule? she can't bear to have her first time unless she's worried about edward breaking her in half?! if i was edward, had bella even suggested such a thing i would have first laughed myself silly, then run screaming in the other direction from such a reckless lunatic. that whole thing really pissed me off.3) pregnant. 17-year-old vampire edward and 18-year-old human bella. ew. ew. ew. i can accept the marriage, because edward will never get older, and they love each other. but when i got to that part, and both of their reactions to it, i wanted to scream i was so angry. it is just so small and stupid, so out of place in the story, and contrived. ugh! as so many other people said, i thought it was fanfiction i was reading, not a published work, let alone from the actual author. i'm curious as to what meyer was smoking when she thought this was an appropriate plot line. but it got worse. what suspension of disbelief i had left broke, and i became permanently removed from the story. i began to hate bella, and resent edward's cardboard characterization. 4) their weird mutant spawn literally kills bella slowly. and she couldn't be more thrilled about it. the fact that meyer had made the ridiculously immature, but lovable and relatable teenager bella pregnant was bad enough. but then it is with some weird, unknown mutant parasite, that saps all her strength, breaks several of her bones (including her spine) and causes various bruises, and makes her drink human blood. during bella's pregnancy, i was literally shuddering with disgust on almost every page. that is not an exaggeration. and i'm 19. no joke, i was rooting for the wolves to attack the cullens and kill the thing. bella and edward's characters fly so far off their character rails that you can't even see them any more. bella whole-heartedly embraces the thing while it slowly kills her, and edward does nothing but hopelessly mope about it. 5) the birth and bella's transformation. ugggghhhh. this was hands-down the most disturbing passage i have ever read. i had to put the book down to take some deep breaths several times out of anger and disgust, and then wrestle with myself about whether or not to keep reading multiple times on one page. my edward and bella. who fell in love as lab partners, and cutely fought because of their stubborn personalities. here, bella, dieing and screaming in agony, vomits blood while the mutant baby inside of her destroys her body, internal organs and spine. edward uses his teeth to bite the baby out of her uterus. bella dies and then edward injects vampire venom into her heart with a syringe.this is how bella starts her new life with him. total slap. in. the. face. i was ready to drive to arizona, find stephenie meyer's house, and burn it down.6) renesmee. this is what bella names their child. ruh. nez. may. a combination of renee and esme. seriously?seriously, stephenie meyer?

1,"so when my hp laptop broke down, i wanted to find a new computer that would be affordable but functional. that's when i discovered the netbook genre. with so many brands out there, asus's eee pc, acer's aspire one, msi's wind, hp's atom, the list goes on, it can get a bit confusing. but at the end of the day, all of these netbooks are similar, if not exactly the same when it comes down to the technical specifications (screen size, processor, hard drive, wireless card, software, etc).but there are several features that set this netbook apart. first, the samsung nc-10 came out on top with its 6 cell battery (many other netbooks only have a 3 cell), which equals a minimum of 4.5 hours, and easily over 7 hours when in its power saving mode. also, this model has a 160gb hard drive, leaps and bounds over what many other netbooks offer. and, in another great stride, if you want to increase the ram (from 1gb to 2gb), samsung did a brilliant job making the ram so accessible. it's as simple as removing a screw from a panel on the bottom of the computer that says ""memory"", removing the panel, and switching out the memory aka ram. the function keys are very useful, for everything from volume, screen resolution, power mode, wireless networking, external screen options, and more, making using this computer a genuinely fun experience. i had vista running on my old laptop, and even though i have not upgraded the ram, this thing runs effortlessly with the xp provided. if you are worried about windows xp, don't be, because i have transferred every single application that i had with vista to this computer, and have lost zero performance. it even has a slot to insert sd memory cards (unfortunately not for memory sticks).now, nothing is perfect. first of all, i have medium sized hands, and though the keyboard works great for touch typing, there isn't much space between the start of the keyboard and the end of the computer to rest your wrists on, which can strain yours hands after a while. purchasing a wrist pad will help. also, one drawback of having one of the roomiest keyboards on the netbook market (95% full size) means this has a smaller touch pad. it's very reactive and has the same pinch/stretch properties that apple touchpads have, but it still takes some getting used to. also, i got this in blue, and the top is a fingerprint magnet. and if you plan on playing music from your netbook, be sure to get external speakers, because these speakers are by far the worst thing about it, with a generic tinny sound to them. if i had to go back and do it again, i would definitely buy this computer again. of course, in the world of technology, things constantly change, so in about a year i may have my eyes on a vista or windows 7 netbook, but for now i'm very happy with this purchase.","so when my hp laptop break down, i want to find a new computer that would be affordable but functional. that's when i discover the netbook genre. with so many brand out

""the dark knight"" is faster paced than ""batman begins"" but that is to be expected because with any good comic-book or superhero adaptation...the first movie should always be about the backstory or how batman came to be batman.  sometimes it is done well like in ""iron man"" or ""batman begins"" and sometimes you get ""the fantastic four""   these movies are almost like the james bond movies in that the movie is only as good as its villian.  in this regard it is heath ledger that takes this movie the extra mile.  many in here have said that if he didn't die soon afterwords there would have been no big deal over his performance...that could not be more untrue.  his performance has nothing to do with his death.  he delivered the most chillingly real picture of evil on the screen since hopkins in ""the silence of the lambs.""  the performance was picture perfect, from the designer suits, to the unkept hair, to the tick of sticking out his tongue like a serpent.   helping balance the chaos on that side are real grounded performances from christian bale and gary olman (i defy anyone to find a movie in which he gived a subpar performance!)   the special effects are fantastic, but they never become a crutch for nolan because at its heart this is a character study.  some would probably have liked 2+ hours of mayhem, but those are probably the same people who hated ""3:10 to yuma"" because there were not enough shoot-outs.  these movies are about the men behind the action, not the action itself.   i am dissappointed by the lack of features.  if a company is going to market a special edition and charge you more for it, it should be bursting with extra stuff...but in the end, you buy the movie for the movie.","this review be from: the dark knight (widescreen single-disc edition) (dvd) it be kind of funny when you read what people have to say about this movie. like anything else in pop-culture, for every ten people who love it there be ten more who think it's terrible, or boring, or too violent. the movie be not terrible. it be fast-paced and entertaining. nolan start with a number of thread at the begin and bring them all together by the mid-point of the picture.

 my husband (voluntarily) said that he would rather have our pizzas than any other he's ever tasted, and we can choose healthier alternatives by making our own - like canadian bacon or turkey, italian sausage pizzas.  i have noticed a difference in sound when mixing pumpkin pie ingredients, but that might be normal (and i might be overly concerned about the gear box).  kitchenaid documented my concern, at my request, in case i should have a bigger problem down the road.  i might also take an idea from ""cats rule"" and purchase a few other attachments from amazon.com.  i am thrilled with my kitchenaid mixer, the kitchenaid company, and always with amazon.com!","update 8/22/08 - this mixer still work beautifully. while i don't make bread daily, i do make pizza dough almost weekly and i love this mixer. it also whip cream better (because of the flatter bowl bottom design) than my slightly smaller, older kitchenaid. i'm still thrill with this product and amazon.com.....(previous review) like the reviewer, ""cats rule"", i, too, have an old workhorse kitchenaid mixer that be about twenty-five year old and ha only need one repair throughout all of those year and hundred of cooky and cakes. i will never let ""old reliable"" go (i have withdrawal symptom when i have to send it to kitchenaid for the repair which take a month) but i also want a larger capacity mixer. i purchase this one from amazon.com a couple of week ago and so far it ha be fabulous. for the first time in my life i make pizza dough, three batch in two weeks, use the kitchenaid recipe, at the recommend speed of 2, and both the mixer and pizza dough be great. i do find another recipe that differ only in the amount of olive oil use (1 tablespoon v the kitchenaid 1 tsp) which work even better for u (slightly le crisp crust and work beautifully with the dough hook). i find that if i use too much flour and/or too little olive oil, the mixer do vibrate a tiny bite but still keep mixing. one really great difference between the older, five quart mixer and this new, larger one be the shape of the bowl. the 600 series ha a slightly flatter bowl which allow better mix without have to use a spatula at frequent interval to incorporate the batter at the bottom of the bowl. i read all of the review before purchase this mixer, which really helps, and i be look for any sign of the gear box break (we haven't take it apart yet to see if we have a metal or plastic box). i do speak to kitchenaid before i make this investment and they say they would replace the gear box with a metal one if mine should have a problem. i intend to keep make bread or pizza dough each week, and larger batch of cooky during this first year - not only to test the mixer, but because the mixer work so well, so far, and there be so many fantastic cookie, cake, bread and pizza recipe out there!

1,"i've spent several weeks week getting to know the zojirushi fresh brew... and for the most part, i'm quite pleased. it has some foibles [which i'll get to in a moment] but on the whole it's a very capable coffee brewer. more, it's one of the very few home models i know that can brew 8 cups of just-roasted coffee at a proper 2 tablespoons per cup ratio without fuss, and - this is important! - maintain proper brewing temperatures throughout the entire brew cycle.the details...zoji has been making vacuum pots and the like for nearly 100 years, and they've been making an assortment of rice-cookers, tea brewers and hot water dispensers for decades. while this is, i believe, their first home coffee brewer, they've got more than a little experience in kitchen electrics. they've put that experience to good use.if you've ever brewed up a thermos full of coffee using a big melitta filter cone then this setup will look pretty familiar. for all intents and purposes, the fresh brew simply adds an automated hot water delivery system to the mix... with a few improvements.improvement number one: not only does this system brew into an all-stainless thermal carafe [no hot plate here, thankyouverymuch] but it also insulates the brew basket. what good is it, after all, to heat up all that water if it's just going to get cold while you're brewing? this is huge! this is important! this is... well, i'm excited about it, okay?improvement number two: the fresh brew features an accurate gauge of water volume. when it reads that you've got 8 cups of water in the brewer's reservoir, it means it. mind you, we're talking 6 oz. cups of water -- that's the way the coffee world measures a cup [unless you're bodum and then it's 4 oz.].improvement number three: the fresh brew is patient. the biggest pain about the manual pour-over method is that you've got to wait to add more water, especially if the coffee is really fresh. fresh coffee blooms with its charge of co2! faced with a full basket of coffee that was literally fresh from the roaster the zoji didn't overflow, nor did it heave grounds into the water dispensing shower-head. more, the grounds were thoroughly saturated; no dry spots.so where's the foibles?like a great many autodrip brewers the feeder tube that comes from the zoji's heating element to the shower-head takes a straight path right through the water reservoir. for most brewers this is a game-over situation... the heating element simply can't overcome the heat exchange that occurs en route to the brew-head. on the zoji, the heating element *does* get hot enough... provided that the water you've placed in the reservoir is not *too* cold.    example a: in the office using the ""unchilled"" spigot on the water cooler, i draw off 48 ounces of water for the reservoir and brew a pot. throughout the brew cycle water temperatures in the brew basket range between 195 and 200 degrees f. the result is a lovely pot of ethiopian yrgacheffe that is sweet, floral and lemony.    example b: at home i draw off 48 ounces of water from the water filter in-line with the refridgerator. the temperature of the water in the reservoir is about 40 degrees f. and the resulting temperature in the brew basket never tops 185 degrees f. the result is an icky pot of the very same yrgacheffe that is bitter, murky and flat.the moral: mind your initial water temperature and you'll do just fine.all in all, the zojirushi fresh brew is capable of making 8 cups of coffee that's on a par with manual pourover methods. better, really, as it insulates the brew-basket to better maintain water temperatures.","i've spend several week week get to know the zojirushi fresh brew... and for the most part, i'm quite pleased. it ha some foible [which i'll get to in a moment] but on the whole it's a very capable coffee brewer. more, it's one of the very few home model i know that can brew 8 cup of just-roasted coffee at a proper 2 tablespoon per cup ratio without fuss, and - this be important! - maintain proper brew temperature throughout the entire brew cycle.the details...zoji ha be make vacuum pot and the like for nearly 100 years, and they've be make an assortment of rice-cookers, tea brewer and hot water dispenser for decades. while this is, i believe, their first home coffee brewer, they've get more than a little experience in kitchen electrics. they've put that experience to good use.if you've ever brew up a thermos full of coffee use a big melitta filter cone then this setup will look pretty familiar. for all intent and purposes, the fresh brew simply add an automate hot water delivery system to the mix... with a few improvements.improvement number one: not only doe this system brew into an all-stainless thermal carafe [no hot plate here, thankyouverymuch] but it also insulate the brew basket. what good be it, after all, to heat up all that water if it's just go to get cold while you're brewing?

1,"although this is my first netbook, i have experience with several brands and sizes of laptops.  i love this little computer. before purchasing it i had also researched the asus 901, 904ha, 1000ha, the samsung nc10, dell mini 9, and lenovo ideapad. i chose this one because it looked sturdy, had a 6 cell battery option, has wireless b/g/n and bluetooth, 160gb hdd and 1gb ram for a price lower than comparable models in other brands. and its cute. here are some of my feelings on the product:1) the lack of an optical drive can be a little inconvenient, but one cannot be expected in such a small package. given the abundance of online downloads offered by major industries (gaming, virus protection, word documents) this really does not present much of a problem except for playing cds or dvds.2) i had read in several reviews that the larger 6 cell battery makes the unit ""tippy."" i have noticed that if i push the screen without holding the keyboard it will lean backwards (keep in mind the entire thing is <3lbs), but i also lounge with this machine on the couch and it has yet to tumble backwards.    3) while reading reviews on various netbooks i found that a common complaint was their inability to multitask or operate quickly.  i find that this little netbook is able to have several tabs open at once, while downloading and supporting word documents.  with its 1gb ram it is not the fastest, but i certainly have no complaints.  even with zonealarm security suite and forcefield running in the background the wind still boots up at a snappy pace and surfs the net easily.4) i admit that i was concerned about the battery life of this machine because i could find very little about its realtime life.  one of the major draws toward the asus 904 was that most reviews said that it got around 5 hours. the wind does not get quite that much, more like 4-4.5 hours while typing and browsing the web. i was surprised that during its initial setup (installation of web browser, virus software, word) it pulled about 3.5-4 hours despite numerous restarts.5) the keyboard is quite comfortable for my hands. my first laptop had a 12"" screen so i am accustomed to slightly smaller keyboards, and i suppose the size of this one might be a problem for some. one feature i particularly like is that my thumb does not hit the touchpad when i go for the space bar as it did on many netbooks. punctuation buttons are also smaller.5) some reviews had mentioned that the touchpad only had one button. yes, this is true, but the two sides of that button operate as left and right mouse buttons. if you try to push it in the middle nothing happens.  unlike some other netbooks, the touchpad button does not require much pressure.6) the wireless networks that i have tried thus far have been easy to connect to and have an excellent connection (not the connection that the computer shows, but the internet works quickly and i am not booted off).7) the side vents are wonderful! in the past i have had a problem blocking my laptops' vents by putting them on the couch/carpet/my lap.  this is not a problem with the wind, which vents air through vents on the left side.one note: most pictures show the computer without the battery.  the 6 cell battery does boost the computer up a bit, which was initially of great concern, but i have found that it is not too much to worry about unless you are set on having it flush against the desk.i have already ordered an additional gb of ram since the machine can support 2gb, and i can't wait to see how it runs with that.","although this be my first netbook, i have experience with several brand and size of laptops. i love this little computer. before purchase it i have also research the asus 901, 904ha, 1000ha, the samsung nc10, dell mini 9, and lenovo ideapad. i choose this one because it look sturdy, have a 6 cell battery option, ha wireless b/g/n and bluetooth, 160gb hdd and 1gb ram for a price lower than comparable model in other brands. and it cute. here be some of my feel on the product:1) the lack of an optical drive can be a little inconvenient, but one cannot be expect in such a small package. give the abundance of online download offer by major industry (gaming, virus protection, word documents) this really doe not present much of a problem except for play cd or dvds.2) i have read in several review that the larger 6 cell battery make the unit ""tippy."" i have notice that if i push the screen without hold the keyboard it will lean backwards (keep in mind the entire thing be <3lbs), but i also lounge with this machine on the couch and it ha yet to tumble backwards. 3) while read review on various netbooks i find that a common complaint wa their inability to multitask or operate quickly. i find that this little netbook be able to have several tab open at once, while download and support word documents. with it 1gb ram it be not the fastest, but i certainly have no complaints. even with zonealarm security suite and forcefield run in the background the wind still boot up at a snappy pace and surf the net easily.4) i admit that i wa concern about the battery life of this machine because i could find very little about it realtime life. one of the major draw toward the asus 904 wa that most review say that it get around 5 hours. the wind doe not get quite that much, more like 4-4.5 hour while type and browse the web. i wa surprise that during it initial setup (installation of web browser, virus software, word) it pull about 3.5-4 hour despite numerous restarts.5) the keyboard be quite comfortable for my hands. my first laptop have a 12"" screen so i be accustom to slightly smaller keyboards, and i suppose the size of this one might be a problem for some. one feature i particularly like be that my thumb doe not hit the touchpad when i go for the space bar a it do on many netbooks. punctuation button be also smaller.5) some review have mention that the touchpad only have one button. yes, this be true, but the two side of that button operate a leave and right mouse buttons. if you try to push it in the middle nothing happens. unlike some other netbooks, the touchpad button doe not require much pressure.6) the wireless network that i have try thus far have be easy to connect to and have an excellent connection (not the connection that the computer shows, but the internet work quickly and i be not boot off).7) the side vent be wonderful!

0,"here are my impressions of this sad, sad ""book"":1.  edward & bella's relationship - this was the biggest disappointment in the book.  all romance completely and utterly vanished.  this book pretty much ruined their romance for me. 2.  different tone - the book had a completely different tone from the previous three.  it didn't even feel like the same author/series.  what replaced the exhilarating, somewhat innocent romance was disgusting and disturbing (i.e. the pregnancy, birth, transformation, imprinting on renesme, etc.)  i found myself literally gagging at some parts.  don't know how they'll make this one into a movie!  actually, a movie could be a good thing.  the writer could completely change every dumb thing that meyer did and fix the story!3.  inconsistent characters - this is kind of like #2.  none of the characters (with the exception of jacob) were anything like their former, lively, loveable selves.  they were mere shadows of what they'd been in the past.   i could go on and on on this one, but it would take too long to go through every character.  i'll get to a couple of the main ones.4.  edward -  he was a mopey, brooding non-factor for 95% of the book completely devoid of charisma, charm, and personality.  at one particularly low moment, he even suggests that bella can fornicate with jacob just so she can have babies!!!!!!!!  what?!?!?!   i had less love for edward after this book for sure.5.  the wedding - my wedding was better than bella's, and she had endless money, vampire talents, and a writer's imagination and creativity to work with! 6.  the sex - ok, so it's a young adult book (although i don't really think a lot of the material is suitable for young adults in this one)... i get the whole ""fade to black"" thing.  but, afterward, did bella really have to turn into a whiney, sniveling twit, begging for it????7.  disappearance of the cullens - they were barely in this book at all, except for rosalie's disturbing, overbearing protection of bella's stomach.  i don't think esme had one sentence to say the whole time.  i couldn't believe how little alice was involved in the book.  she was one of the best characters in the other three.  how could meyer just abandon her?  and the whole thing where she leaves bella a ""clue"" about her disappearance in a book... gimme a break. 8.  pregnancy - really dumb plot line.  i can't even believe she went there.  not only is it gross, but pretty implausible considering he's a vampire.  do they have super-sperm now, too?9.  renesme carlie -  need i say more?10.  jacob the pedophile - i don't care how she ""cleverly"" set this up by making quil imprint on a little kid and trying to explain that away.  it is still really disturbing and dumb... and, oh, a little too convenient that he imprinted on renesme.  he was the only character whose ""voice"" didn't change, which was nice, but i really am offended at the way meyer resolved his character.  he deserved way more after the way bella figuratively kicked the crap out of him for two books.11.  bella's anticlimactic transformation - for three books we've been told how painful, how awful the transformation is.  we were told how difficult it is to be a newborn vampire, and how a person loses himself/herself for a while.  now, granted that meyer unsubtlely set bella up to practically not be a human in the first place, since she obviously didn't fit in with humanity for many reasons, but still... it was all so easy!  the pain was barely mentioned, and practically from the first second she ""woke up,"" she was the perfect ""vegetarian"" vampire.  not even a struggle!  what a joke!12.  charlie - i don't even know where to start with this one.  he's perfectly fine with the existence of werewolves and the knowledge that his daughter is obviously not the same as she was and that he has a granddaughter already who ages at an insane rate........ as long as you don't give him any details.  ignorance is bliss, i guess.  so convenient that he can still be in bella's life now.13.  renee - i guess bella didn't need to freak out about what her mother would think about getting married as a teenager.  oh yeah, did i mention that bella got married as a teenager?  i thought we were in washington, not the deep south.14.  new cast of characters - some of the ""vampire army"" that assembled at the cullen house was interesting.  but there were so many of them!  meyer just kept piling them on.  they ended up not even being necessary and just watered-down the plot.15.  the non-battle w/the volturi - the battle was getting a little tense until the volturi completely backed down like a bunch of...   kitty cats.  these volturi don't seem so scary to me anymore.  after all, they didn't kill edward, bella, and alice in volterra (without much of a struggle or argument at all, mind you) and they took their sweet time to check out the seattle vampires in eclipse.  really, it just seemed like all you had to do was ""wink, wink"" at aro, and he'd let you slide.16.  bella the non-heroine - this one has two parts:a) it would have been a little more redeeming if bella had saved them all with her shield.  at least then she would have some point in the book.  but she didn't!  it was alice who rushes in from who-knows-where with some ridiculous explanation about finding other vamps like renesme who saves the day.  really convenient that meyer made up these new beings at the precise moment that she needed them.  let's write a book and just make crap up from out of the blue at the climax to save all our characters.  no one important died, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but would add depth/credibility to the overall struggle in the book.b)   bella doesn't have to sacrifice anything.  in the end, she gets everything she wants, all tied up with a neat little bow.  she doesn't have to give up being a mother to be with edward (which was a big deal in eclipse).  she suddenly wants to be married, go to college, have kids, etc.  she doesn't have to give up her soul, because apparently no one really cared about that anymore or mentioned it much in the book.  she doesn't have to give up charlie.  she doesn't give two thoughts about what she'll do about renee, so i guess she doesn't care.  she doesn't have to hurt jacob anymore because he magically doesn't love her.  she doesn't have to struggle with edward over the notion of her becoming a vampire... he doesn't have a choice in the matter--she'll die if she doesn't become one.  she doesn't have to go through any pain, suffering, or uncertainty when she becomes a newborn vampire.   she doesn't have to worry about the volturi.  bella had so much potential to be a great character.  meyer just completely blew it.17.  the werewolves aren't werewolves - oh yeah, did we forget to mention that they're actually not werewolves?  they're actually shapeshifters, so, yeah... no problem.18.  the writing blows - in meyer's defense, it always did.  there are a myriad of technical reasons i could get into about why meyer is a terrible writer, but they're really moot at this point.  this book lacked what the other three did to make up for it: wit, interesting characters, love, and charm. some people are annoyed by the way bella gets married and has a kid young and that the ending is happy.  there are also a lot of sexist notions in the book, but i won't go into that here, and i'm usually not bothered by that kind of thing in general.  i don't really mind the ending either, i just wished some of the above had been different.  thank goodness for the movie... it got me back into the series.  but i'll probably never read breaking dawn again.  i'll just pretend it ended with eclipse and imagine my own ending.  it's sure as sh** better than what meyer came up with!  what a cash cow!  she should be ashamed!on a side note, there is another book called midnight sun, that retells twilight from edward's point of view.  she wrote about 250 pages of it and then it somehow got leaked on the internet.  she says she's so heartbroken and destroyed over it that she won't finish it or publish it now.  i think that's b.s.  i think she's so sick over how bad breaking dawn is and how so many people slam it and hate it and how she ruined the series, that she's chicken to finish midnight sun.  cop-out.","here be my impression of this sad, sad ""book"":1. edward & bella's relationship - this wa the biggest disappointment in the book. all romance completely and utterly vanished. this book pretty much ruin their romance for me. 2. different tone - the book have a completely different tone from the previous three. it didn't even feel like the same author/series. what replace the exhilarating, somewhat innocent romance wa disgust and disturb (i.e. the pregnancy, birth, transformation, imprint on renesme, etc.) i find myself literally gag at some parts. don't know how they'll make this one into a movie! actually, a movie could be a good thing. the writer could completely change every dumb thing that meyer do and fix the story!3. inconsistent character - this be kind of like #2. none of the character (with the exception of jacob) be anything like their former, lively, loveable selves. they be mere shadow of what they'd be in the past. i could go on and on on this one, but it would take too long to go through every character. i'll get to a couple of the main ones.4. edward - he wa a mopey, brood non-factor for 95% of the book completely devoid of charisma, charm, and personality. at one particularly low moment, he even suggest that bella can fornicate with jacob just so she can have babies!!!!!!!! what?!?!?! i have le love for edward after this book for sure.5. the wed - my wed wa better than bella's, and she have endless money, vampire talents, and a writer's imagination and creativity to work with! 6. the sex - ok, so it's a young adult book (although i don't really think a lot of the material be suitable for young adult in this one)... i get the whole ""fade to black"" thing. but, afterward, do bella really have to turn into a whiney, snivel twit, beg for it????7. disappearance of the cullens - they be barely in this book at all, except for rosalie's disturbing, overbear protection of bella's stomach. i don't think esme have one sentence to say the whole time. i couldn't believe how little alice wa involve in the book. she wa one of the best character in the other three. how could meyer just abandon her? and the whole thing where she leaf bella a ""clue"" about her disappearance in a book... gimme a break. 8. pregnancy - really dumb plot line. i can't even believe she go there. not only be it gross, but pretty implausible consider he's a vampire. do they have super-sperm now, too?9. renesme carlie - need i say more?10. jacob the pedophile - i don't care how she ""cleverly"" set this up by make quil imprint on a little kid and try to explain that away. it be still really disturb and dumb... and, oh, a little too convenient that he imprint on renesme. he wa the only character whose ""voice"" didn't change, which wa nice, but i really be offend at the way meyer resolve his character. he deserve way more after the way bella figuratively kick the crap out of him for two books.11. bella's anticlimactic transformation - for three book we've be tell how painful, how awful the transformation is. we be tell how difficult it be to be a newborn vampire, and how a person lose himself/herself for a while. now, grant that meyer unsubtlely set bella up to practically not be a human in the first place, since she obviously didn't fit in with humanity for many reasons, but still... it wa all so easy! the pain wa barely mentioned, and practically from the first second she ""woke up,"" she wa the perfect ""vegetarian"" vampire. not even a struggle! what a joke!12. charlie - i don't even know where to start with this one. he's perfectly fine with the existence of werewolf and the knowledge that his daughter be obviously not the same a she wa and that he ha a granddaughter already who age at an insane rate........ a long a you don't give him any details. ignorance be bliss, i guess. so convenient that he can still be in bella's life now.13. renee - i guess bella didn't need to freak out about what her mother would think about get marry a a teenager. oh yeah, do i mention that bella get marry a a teenager?

 and insights often lead to positive changes.i bought, used, and discarded a half-dozen cheap, inaccurate, poorly-designed pedometers.  i would run 3 miles and find the pedometer had recorded 92 steps.  i had clips break, cases split from being dropped, i jabbed myself on sharp case corners when bending over.   then i found the omron hj-112 at amazon and it immediately stood out above all the others.the hj-112 is accurate -- within 1-2%, based on my experience.  accuracy with my other pedometers was more like 5-10%.  and the hj-112's accuracy is largely independent of wearing position -- clipped on a belt or shoe, hanging from a lanyard, loose in a shirt or pants pocket, it really doesn't matter.  most other brands need to be clipped at a very specific hip position to get accurate counts.  the hj-112 can be easily used all day.  when you're exercising, you'll probably want to use its clip or lanyard.  but pedometers don't really go with business attire so when you're at work or out in public, just pop it out of it's belt clip and put it in a pocket.  omron says a purse will also do -- i'm skeptical -- but a fanny pack certainly works.  the clip is quite secure, and the clip attachment to the pedometer itself is excellent: very easy to insert/remove and in two years of use, i've never had it accidently pop off.  the belt clip can work itself loose with repeated flexing if it's sandwiched between two surfaces like abdomen/thigh -- for example, squatting over pulling weeds.  i learned this first hand while squatting doing repairs on the roof of a two-story house. the clip pulled off and the pedometer fell 20 feet onto concrete.  it didn't survive.  i chaulked it up as a life-lesson and ordered a new one from amazon.  now when i'm doing that kind of work, i try to remember to carry the hj-112 in my pocket.  i have dropped the hj-112 onto concrete and other hard surfaces from more reasonable heights up to 6-7 feet, with no ill effects -- the belt clip is soft, flexible plastic and a pretty-good energy dissipator.  i regularly run 3-4 miles, and i've never had the clip come loose. the best feature of the hj-112 to me is it's auto-reset, which i didn't really appreciate until i used the unit for a couple of days.  each night at midnight, it stores the previous day's step count in memory and resets the current step count to zero.  it stores a week's worth of step counts, which are retrieved with the memory button, though it doesn't store any of the other computed info (calories, miles, etc.).  this really makes it easy to use every day.  no more frustration when you realize mid-afternoon that you forgot to reset the pedometer that morning.  and since it has a clock, it's also able to evaluate steps per minute, which it uses to report ""aerobic steps"": 60 steps/minute or higher, or 10 minutes of continuous walking.the display is easy to read, the clock is remarkably accurate -- better than my ipod's -- though it doesn't handle daylight savings time changes automatically.  the buttons are nicely sized with a good, tactile feel.  the battery lasts 18 months or so, and is easily replaced.i recommend this product.","survive a heart attack 2-1/2 year ago belatedly make me a real believer in the 10,000 step a day concept, thank to the staff in the coronary heart disease reversal program at the uc davis med center. daily exercise be one important component of their program, and a pedometer be a great tool to help you evaluate how much exercise you're getting, not just in 45 minute on a treadmill or exercise bike at the gymn, but in your daily activity around your home, yard, and work. use a pedometer daily can give you some surprise insight about your life-style. who knew, for example, that shop can qualify a exercise when there's walk involved?

1,"i bought the flip ultra a few days ago, and i haven't been able to put it down.  like most parents, i have a minidv camcorder, but i haven't been using it to take as many movies of my kids as i should have, so i bought this to keep on me at (almost) all times.  here is what i have found so far:pros:  it's truly pocket sized.  it starts up in seconds, and operation could not be any simpler.  the video seems slightly better than the movie mode on my digital camera, and the sound is better.  because it's cheap (i paid sixty bucks), i'm not worried about damaging it, and as long as you are somewhat aware that there is a lens, there is not much to break anyway.  the software, once it's working, is also very simple, and yes, the program outputs normal *.avi files.  indoor light makes acceptable videos.  schoolroom lighting was perfect.  outdoors, when the sun was low in the sky, i got a lot of washout (to be fair, it would have been tough for any camera).cons:  it's hard to make a non-shaky video.  there is no electronic image stabilization or anything like it, and the thing is so light that it's tough to hold it steady.  that little screen on the back is your only indicator of whether or not you are holding it steady.  there is no memory card slot, just internal memory.  i had some annoying problems with the software, which is built in to the camera.  the first time you plug it in, it installs onto the computer.  it immediately recognized that there was an update available, so i downloaded that and installed it.  the problem came when the computer wanted to update the camera - my camera was filled with video, so it said it would do it later.  fine.  i removed my files, fired the program back up - and it installed the update to the camera.  then i was barraged with requests to reinstall the update - constantly - when the camera was plugged into the computer.  i had to uninstall the software and reinstall from the camera.  now, it still wants to re-install the program when it gets plugged in, but it only asks once now, and i can live with that little annoyance.so know what you are getting - your normal camcorder will take better videos, but you probably won't have it in your pocket when something spontaneous happens.","i buy the flip ultra a few day ago, and i haven't be able to put it down. like most parents, i have a minidv camcorder, but i haven't be use it to take a many movie of my kid a i should have, so i buy this to keep on me at (almost) all times. here be what i have find so far:pros: it's truly pocket sized. it start up in seconds, and operation could not be any simpler. the video seem slightly better than the movie mode on my digital camera, and the sound be better. because it's cheap (i pay sixty bucks), i'm not worry about damage it, and a long a you be somewhat aware that there be a lens, there be not much to break anyway. the software, once it's working, be also very simple, and yes, the program output normal *.avi files. indoor light make acceptable videos. schoolroom light wa perfect. outdoors, when the sun wa low in the sky, i get a lot of washout (to be fair, it would have be tough for any camera).cons: it's hard to make a non-shaky video. there be no electronic image stabilization or anything like it, and the thing be so light that it's tough to hold it steady. that little screen on the back be your only indicator of whether or not you be hold it steady. there be no memory card slot, just internal memory. i have some annoy problem with the software, which be build in to the camera. the first time you plug it in, it install onto the computer. it immediately recognize that there wa an update available, so i download that and instal it. the problem come when the computer want to update the camera - my camera wa fill with video, so it say it would do it later. fine. i remove my files, fire the program back up - and it instal the update to the camera. then i wa barrage with request to reinstall the update - constantly - when the camera wa plug into the computer. i have to uninstall the software and reinstall from the camera. now, it still want to re-install the program when it get plug in, but it only ask once now, and i can live with that little annoyance.so know what you be get - your normal camcorder will take better videos, but you probably won't have it in your pocket when something spontaneous happens.",able like keep truly star slight lightly sound cheap worry about long soft very simple yes normal accept perfect low fair tough hard shaky thin old steady back your just first want to ill fine back up constantly still ably

company from his father's right hand man, obadiah stane (jeff bridges) and the two work together, as a team - stark handles the inventions, obadiah handles the business side of things. stark takes a trip to afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. during the attack, tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. when tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. but he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. he then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. when he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. now that tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. naturally, obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. but colonel rhodes (terence howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. and stark's personal assistant, pepper pots (paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. after a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in afghanistan. then, some trouble begins to brew back home.directed by jon favreau (""elf"", ""zathura"" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. this is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. i am an eternal optimist.""iron man"" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. robert downey, jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of tony stark. a rich, highly intelligent industrialist, tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. but he also plays hard. living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in malibu, tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. he is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. he picks up a reporter in vegas and the next morning, in his house in malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. this system allows him to view 3-d holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.as we get to know tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to obadiah. when he travels to afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. but this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides iron man with a formidable foe, the iron monger.when stark is taken prisoner in afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. and he also creates a prototype of iron man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. this is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.downey, jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to stark's sheltered persona. because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. this same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. he proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for stark to live in. his computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes tony and pepper, and addresses them by name. but more importantly, favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with academy award nominated and critically praised films. these actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.gwyneth paltrow plays pepper pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. there is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at walt disney concert hall. but paltrow is wasted in the role. while she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for pepper pots. when she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. and the flirtatious relationship between tony and pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.jeff bridges plays obadiah stane, stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until tony becomes old enough to take the reins. tony continues to work with obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. naturally, he feels threatened by tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. he also steals tony's plans and begins work on his own version of iron man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. so in his mind, lethal is good.obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than i am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.terrence howard plays colonel jim rhodes, a longtime associate of tony, who acts as a liaison between stark and his government contacts. when stark is taken hostage, rhodes leads the rescue mission. when stark becomes iron man, rhodes helps him out in various ways.as you watch the story unfold, you get the sense howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. he plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real.""iron man"" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. the actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. the performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make ""iron man"" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. i can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge ""spiderman"" in popularity.","this review be from: iron man [theatrical release] (theatrical release) marvel comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and it share of profit in the film make by other studio

1,"i own a ka artisan series 5-qt. stand mixer in ""blue willow.""  i am a casual baker and am relatively new in the kitchen and prior to making this purchase, i did quite a bit of research on stand mixers.  i found that the questions you have to ask yourself prior to making this purchase are:(1)  do you really need one, and, if the answer is yes, then;(2)  is this a one-time purchase, and;(3)  which stand mixer actually *fits* your needs?though i was tempted to get a big 6-qt professional, bowl-lifting, super cool mixer, i realized that i generally cook for two people and that i would not need to ever really mix 14-cups of flour or 8 pounds of potatoes.  even if i did, i'd be doing it in smaller batches anyway. so that brought me back to my senses and i considered the ka artisan.comparatively:  oddly, it only has 325 watts of power.  other stand mixers of this size offer up to 500 watts; the ka 6 qt. pro offers 525 watts and a bowl ""lift"" function.  i don't know if this makes a huge difference, but my ka stands up to whatever i put in it.  i use it to make mostly cookie and bread doughs.  it comes with three accessories: flat beater, dough hook, and wire whip.  the flat beater is very versatile and i have really appreciated not having to wrestle with my crappy hand-mixer when mixing things like softened cream cheese.  i can throw it all into the bowl at once and walk away to start something else.cleanup:it's a snap.  while i tend to still get flour all over ""the fuselage,"" as i call my mixer, it wipes off in a jiffy because of the sleek exterior.  i don't find the ""chute"" of the pouring shield especially ""easy"" to add ingredients, especially when it's flour from a big mixing bowl.  the chute is not quite wide enough and flour tends to spill, so sometimes i don't use it, but this creates ""splash-up"" instead, so it's kind of a no-win situation.  the steel bowl is absolutely smooth and so there are no real ridges inside the bowl for anything to stick to.  the accessories twist off in a one-handed motion, are very secure and heavy, and are coated with a slick, non-stick, white finish - washing up is absolutely easy.counter space: you cannot put this away, or you will never get it out again.  so for small apartment dwellers, you must think about your counterspace.  i am a pretty small female, and to me, is heavy, heavy, heavy.  while this is good because it doesn't wobble or ""walk"" across the countertop when it's mixing, this also makes it a gigantic pain to drag it out.  so anticipate that it will take up about 1 cubic foot of your countertop forever and that you should have it somewhere where you don't have to move it.mixing:it is very, very thorough.  it has some weird ""planetary mixing action,"" but whatever that means, it mixes mostly everything evenly.  turn it off before you stick your spatula in.  it handles the stickiest focaccia dough to meringue perfectly, and the bowl ""locks in"" to the base, so you don't have to worry about it flying off.attachments:these are super pricey in most cases, but the one that seems to draw the most raves is the pasta cutter (apprx. $100).  ka constantly has deals and sometimes has nice packaged deals on their website, so check there as well.  i have seen ka offer different accessories (including this one) for free on rebate, so watch for those.  ka also is constantly flogging ""the mixer bible"" by meredith deeds and on their website, they sometimes have an ask-and-answer with the author.  i do recommend getting a stand-mixer cover, or if you want to make one, there are several patterns available on the internet.  i'm lazy and cheap, so i use a big dishrag and that has worked so far.overall, i'm glad i made the purchase.  when i do use ""the fuselage"" for baking jobs, it performs flawlessly and makes the baking much, much easier - you can get a good look at your dough consistency, etc. instead of worrying about if your frosting has unmixed chunks in it, or if your hand mixer is going to tip your entire bowl of pudding over while you run to get some missed ingredient.  by proxy, its ease of use turns you into a better cook in the end.  more relaxed, anyway, and if that's worth a couple hundred dollars to you, then by all means, buy it.","i own a ka artisan series 5-qt. stand mixer in ""blue willow."" i be a casual baker and be relatively new in the kitchen and prior to make this purchase, i do quite a bite of research on stand mixers. i find that the question you have to ask yourself prior to make this purchase are:(1) do you really need one, and, if the answer be yes, then;(2) be this a one-time purchase, and;(3) which stand mixer actually *fits* your needs?though i wa tempt to get a big 6-qt professional, bowl-lifting, super cool mixer, i realize that i generally cook for two people and that i would not need to ever really mix 14-cups of flour or 8 pound of potatoes. even if i did, i'd be do it in smaller batch anyway. so that bring me back to my sens and i consider the ka artisan.comparatively: oddly, it only ha 325 watt of power. other stand mixer of this size offer up to 500 watts;

i should hope older readers would be mature enough to realize that the book is not good, and anyone younger shouldn't be reading it. i say ""idealistic"" because the novel very much goes in the ""happy endings for all!"" direction, which, based on the previous novels of the series, should have been impossible, thus making this novel the most extreme deux ex machina i've ever encountered.i must warn away anyone that is even the least bit feminist. throughout the series, bella has always been a bit of a letdown for a lead female character: she allows edward to control almost every aspect of her life, and is so dependent on him that it makes me ill. in this novel, the anti-feminism vibe is pushed even further, with meyer not-so-subtly hinting that all a woman needs to be happy is a husband and babies. meyer also conveys an anti-human vibe - by the end of the novel, pretty much all the central characters are some sort of supernatural species, and they all seem thrilled about the fact. it's disturbing, to say the least.the entire novel was just such a huge disappointment. it completely negated one of the major themes of the series: choice. in eclipse, bella faces the choice between edward and jacob and, knowing what she will give up (charlie and renee, jacob, the possibility of children, college, etc.), she chooses edward. that extreme sacrifice was, i felt, the most defining characteristic of edward and bella's relationship. breaking dawn completely negates that sacrifice with the many deux ex machina plotlines meyer introduces, which cheapens edward and bella's relationship, which, as we all know, was always the central aspect of the series.i won't go into any more specifics, but i will say that there were just so many things in this novel that were completely outrageous. when i first read the spoilers, i didn't even believe them. then when i started reading the novel, i was angry and upset. now, i've joined the masses that are simply laughing at the novel - we laugh so we don't cry ;)in conclusion: read the book for laughs. don't go in with any high expectations of any sort, because you will be severely disappointed.","there be spoiler contain in this review. you have be warned.to be honest, i haven't even be able to bring myself to finish read the book, though i do know what happen due to read spoiler online. i'm just so horrify by what i've read so far that i need to take a break from it. it's corny and overly-contrived and ha many ""wtf"" element that make the novel seem like an elaborate fanfiction.if you be young and idealistic, by all means, read this novel. it's clear that, generally speaking, only reader age 12-14 could even hope to enjoy this novel -

0,"this review is from: gone with the wind (dvd)      if you look beyond the great acting, the magnificent sets, the sweeping landscapes and breathtaking cinematography, ""gone with the wind"" is little more than a high budget soap opera. much of the movie is taken up by the very silly and unmoving romance between scarlett and rhett, two shallow characters who obviously do not belong together, and the various tragedies which befall them after they enter into a sham of a marriage (although it is often difficult to feel much sympathy for a couple living in lavish mansions). the only thing which sets the film apart from the usual daily soap operas about self-desctructive rich people (besides its budget) is its backdrop of the civil war. however, if you want to see a historical film which at least partially resembles reality, then do not watch ""gone with the wind"".the picture the movie draws of the pre-civil war south is an overly romantic one of beauty and wealth and civility. sure, a very small elite of rich landowners did live a lovely and leisurely life in the old south, much like the one portrayed in the opening of the movie, but this was done on the backs of slaves. however, this film makes the old south look like an unspoiled paradise in which nobody had to work. the only thing spoiling this film's picture of a perfect society is the spoiled-brat attitude of the egocentric scarlett o'hara, but she is clearly portrayed as an anomally as other characters try to put up with her antics. after the invaders from the north are shown to impose their way of life upon the south (seemingly by merely introducing industrialization, and the concept of work), scarlett is faced with a total inability to adapt to the new society. however, with her frequent stirring speeches about never going hungry again (yeah, right, try actually living in poverty for a day or two) her inability to adapt is more a condemnation of the changes caused by the civil war than an exploration of any weakness in scarlett's character. gone are the days of dances in large halls and picnics on vast tree-covered lawns (as the blacks toil under the baking sun in the far-off fields). instead, we get scenes of poor rich people loading up buggies to move off of their plantations and into mansions inside of cities only blocks away from the (choke) working classes.in case the viewer doesn't quite get the picture of the ""injustice"" done to the south and thinks ""what about the abolition of slavery?"", every single black character in the movie is offensively portrayed as lazy, silly, and superstitious caricatures who are devoted to and love their white masters and are lost without them. the fact that ""gone with the wind"" hasn't faced as much widespread condemnation as ""birth of a nation"" with its pro-kkk scenes is rather surprising.the only reason i can figure out that such a worthless and offensive soap opera is still considered so great is that most critics are afraid to contradict decades of praise given to the movie at the risk of seeming to lack taste. i say stop being blinded by expectations or conformity and actually judge the film for what it is.","this review be from: go with the wind (dvd) if you look beyond the great acting, the magnificent sets, the sweep landscape and breathtaking cinematography, ""gone with the wind"" be little more

0,"i've spent the last few days struggling to get through this unwieldy tome, only able to read for short periods at a time before my mind clouded over from sheer boredom. i was looking forward to writing this review, but now that i've finished the book and the time has actually come, all i can feel is overwhelmed. there is just so much that is wrong. i'm almost tempted to keep my review to a couple of terse sentences. but i'll write the full version, too; if i can make it through 700-plus pages of literary torture, i'm sure i can write a half-decent review. first, the short version: breaking dawn is awful. don't buy it. and now, the long version: *** spoilers ahead - read at your own risk ***first of all, it seems silly to be warning of spoilers for a book where nothing actually happens.  someone needs to buy stephenie meyer a good book on writing that explains how to construct a plot... and a climax (more on that later).  but a few of some of my bigger complaints have little to do with the way the book was structured and written, and everything to do with the message behind the words. i'm pretty open-minded in my views, but i can not honestly condone any of the messages that meyer puts forth in breaking dawn (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the series). if i had teenage girls who wanted to read this, i would make a concerted effort to dissuade them. meyer seems to have forgotten who her audience is. so what's so bad with the messages in the book? where do i start? 1. bella gets herself pregnant. despite the fact that she's only eighteen and that the fetus is killing her from the inside out, she stubbornly and selfishly insists on carrying the baby to term. she survives... but a real teenage girl with a high-risk pregnancy might not. bella and the baby could have died, and she would have destroyed everyone who loved her. if she really believed she was going to be an immortal and live forever, the threat of eternal hell for having an abortion shouldn't have been an issue.as if the teenage pregnancy isn't bad enough, bella also has the most unrealistic baby imaginable. i even caught myself thinking that maybe having a baby wouldn't be so hard. and that's what i find alarming. i'm a grown adult and the book influenced me (momentarily) that way. what are impulsive teenagers going to take from it? bella's experience was not normal at all; she didn't have to deal with any of the negative aspects of babies. there were no diapers, no 2 am feedings, no temper tantrums, no post-partum depression. bella didn't even have to think about supporting the child because her husband is rich. how many real seventeen-year-old husbands can you say that about?and the way in which bella was able to get pregnant doesn't even make sense. vampires don't eat, don't go to the bathroom, don't sweat, don't grow hair... and yet they can somehow produce sperm from their stone testicles. does meyer need an anatomy textbook as well as a writing manual? (i'm all for fantasy, but it has to be plausible.) one final thought about the baby. eighteen-year-old girls should not be allowed to name their children, because they come up with stupid names like ""renesmee"". the kid's lucky she wasn't named after edward's biological mother instead of his adoptive one. then she would have been ""renizabeth"". to be perfectly honest, though, i don't think that sounds any dumber. 2. too much is made of physical perfection. from what i can see, the only reason that edward is attracted to bella is because of her looks, because she's certainly not interesting. she has no hobbies (except sex), and she even turns her nose up at admission to a prestigious university. eternity is going to get old very fast. but, apparently, edward doesn't seem to mind because meyer makes it seem like a guy who can speak half a dozen languages, write music, play the piano, and otherwise improve his mind is going to be satisfied with a dullard like bella... just as long as he can gaze at her beauty for all eternity. bella, for her part, seems to know what a dud she is; we hear about her low self-esteem endlessly. and yet, she gets the guy anyway. what kind of message does that send to young women? physical beauty is all that matters? that's certainly what i took from it (thank goodness i'm old enough to know better). 3. these vampires are the environment's worst nightmare.  if you're going to be around for centuries, casting aside clothes after one use, driving gas-guzzling sports cars, and taking down large game just to drain the blood... well, you're going to be using up a lot of resources. for creatures who are going to live forever, you'd think they would have a little more foresight. or maybe i just wanted to see vampires driving a fleet of little electric cars. 4. and speaking of cars, portraying bella's child sitting on people's laps in cars is completely irresponsible. i don't care if she's invincible. it doesn't send a good message (britney spears, anyone?). besides... if bella ever got pulled over, wouldn't it be less conspicuous if her child was buckled in safely?there were plenty of other things i didn't like, either. edward's assertion that humans smelled more like carnivores than herbivores was most likely wrong (unless meyer is assuming that all humans eat as many animal products as bella did. honestly, food other than eggs or meat barely crossed her lips. i can't see why she'd smell that good to edward. with a diet like that, she should have smelled like rotting meat). i hated the switch in point of view right in the middle of the book. the descriptions of the wolves patrolling the forest were extremely boring. it almost seemed like a day-by-day account, and nothing was really happening. the switch was also confusing. we're told in that section how other people see bella.  but it's not consistent with what came before and it was as if we were seeing an entirely different character. oh, and i can't forget the whole imprinting thing.  why are all these adult wolves imprinting on toddlers? talk about pedophilic. i don't care that they keep insisting that they have no control over it. there is one person who does have control over it, and that's the author. it would have been weird enough if it had just happened once. but twice? i couldn't get past the feeling that these were pedophiles who were grooming their little victims until they were old enough to actually do something with. for a while, i thought that jacob might imprint on leah (or at least on another grown-up). but that would have been inconvenient for meyer. convenience. that's what this book boils down to, and that's what ultimately makes it fail. isn't it convenient that bella (who has no other talents to speak of) possesses the talent that can save them all? isn't it convenient that, when she finally becomes a vampire, she can restrain herself from killing humans? isn't it convenient that the point of view shifted in the middle of the book to jacob's point of view? isn't it convenient that alice showed up at the last minute with the one person who might give the volturi pause? ohh... don't even get me started on the volturi. i alluded earlier to the fact that this book has a weak plot and climax. i'll correct that statement. it has no climax. the volturi showed up and, aside from barbequing an inconsequential secondary character with a fancy cigarette lighter (or whatever it was), nothing happened. nothing. they talked their way out of the predicament and left. while that may be the ideal situation to conflict in real life, in literature it just makes for boring reading. the promise of the foreshadowing is shot, and the reader just ends up frustrated. the volturi had so much potential as villains, and that potential was completely underutilized.  the high point of the story actually came much earlier, when bella gave birth. by that time, though, i was so frustrated with endless descriptions of wolf patrols and bella's martyrdom that i just wanted the baby to kill her and edward to fail. that would have at least been interesting... and i could have saved myself the hours i spent reading the last half of the novel. in short, this was a book that appears to glorify teenage marriage and parenthood, encourage disrespect for the environment and resources, and condone pedophilic tendencies... all while nothing actually happens. bella got everything without having to sacrifice anything, and everyone lived happily forever after. if you must read breaking dawn, get it from the library. it irks me no end that my dollars have gone to encourage this sort of garbage to be written.","i've spend the last few day struggle to get through this unwieldy tome, only able to read for short period at a time before my mind cloud over from sheer boredom. i wa look forward to write this review, but now that i've finish the book and the time ha actually come, all i can feel be overwhelmed. there be just so much that be wrong. i'm almost tempt to keep my review to a couple of terse sentences. but i'll write the full version, too; if i can make it through 700-plus page of literary torture, i'm sure i can write a half-decent review. first, the short version: break dawn be awful. don't buy it. and now, the long version: *** spoiler ahead - read at your own risk ***first of all, it seem silly to be warn of spoiler for a book where nothing actually happens. someone need to buy stephenie meyer a good book on write that explain how to construct a plot... and a climax (more on that later). but a few of some of my bigger complaint have little to do with the way the book wa structure and written, and everything to do with the message behind the words. i'm pretty open-minded in my views, but i can not honestly condone any of the message that meyer put forth in break dawn (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the series). if i have teenage girl who want to read this, i would make a concert effort to dissuade them. meyer seem to have forget who her audience is. so what's so bad with the message in the book?

0,"this review is from: nights in rodanthe [theatrical release] (theatrical release)      the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane periodically appears credible in the new film nights in rodanthe, adapted from nicholas sparks' novel, but the practicality and reasoning behind nearly all of their actions are unnatural. borrowing heavily from the epic romance of 1980's best picture winner out of africa, nights in rodanthe fails to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates. dr. paul flanner (richard gere) feels responsible for the death of a surgery patient who died from a reaction to anesthesia. in his guilt, he agrees to drive to an isolated beach house in rodanthe, north carolina to meet with the husband (scott glenn), who has filed a lawsuit against the dispirited doctor. the trip is on the way to his ultimate destination, however, which is to retrieve his son (james franco) from equador, where he has moved to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handling of the fated operation.meanwhile, adrienne willis (diane lane) is struggling with her two young children, who are in turn coping with their parent's recent divorce. adrienne wants nothing to do with her unfaithful husband jack (christopher meloni) who foments discontent with their children to coerce their mother into allowing him back. when jack takes the kids for a spell, adrienne travels to rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend - the same vacation house that dr. flanner has booked - leaving the two of them alone to slowly craft a life-changing romance.the love story that builds from so many tragedies simply isn't convincing. the unmindful, unlucky doctor meets with the distraught mother in a terrifying hurricane - what a perfect setting for romance. even looking past the uninspired genesis, nights in rodanthe doesn't utilize its surprisingly short running time to develop the characters. the audience doesn't have time to become involved in their sudden affair, and the rest of their wooing takes place through voiceovers as they narrate love letters back and forth. it's like a sillier version of out of africa, but with more crying, less sweeping romance, and more modernized problems for the lovers to contend with. not as lengthy and noticeably missing a moving soundtrack and score, the story has been done repeatedly (especially from nicholas sparks); as a motion picture it is simply not ambitious enough to create a worthwhile movie-going experience.- mike massie","this review be from: night in rodanthe [theatrical release] (theatrical release) the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane periodically appear credible in the new film night in rodanthe, adapt from nicholas sparks' novel, but the practicality and reason behind nearly all of their action be unnatural. borrow heavily from the epic romance of 1980's best picture winner out of africa, night in rodanthe fail to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates. dr. paul flanner (richard gere) feel responsible for the death of a surgery patient who die from a reaction to anesthesia. in his guilt, he agree to drive to an isolate beach house in rodanthe, north carolina to meet with the husband (scott glenn), who ha file a lawsuit against the dispirit doctor. the trip be on the way to his ultimate destination, however, which be to retrieve his son (james franco) from equador, where he ha move to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handle of the fat operation.meanwhile, adrienne willis (diane lane) be struggle with her two young children, who be in turn cop with their parent's recent divorce. adrienne want nothing to do with her unfaithful husband jack (christopher meloni) who foment discontent with their child to coerce their mother into allow him back. when jack take the kid for a spell, adrienne travel to rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend - the same vacation house that dr. flanner ha book - leave the two of them alone to slowly craft a life-changing romance.the love story that build from so many tragedy simply isn't convincing. the unmindful, unlucky doctor meet with the distraught mother in a terrify hurricane - what a perfect set for romance. even look past the uninspired genesis, night in rodanthe doesn't utilize it surprisingly short run time to develop the characters. the audience doesn't have time to become involve in their sudden affair, and the rest of their woo take place through voiceovers a they narrate love letter back and forth. it's like a sillier version of out of africa, but with more crying, le sweep romance, and more modernize problem for the lover to contend with. not a lengthy and noticeably miss a move soundtrack and score, the story ha be do repeatedly (especially from nicholas sparks);

0,"transporter is such an amazing film, a real surprise, great timing, interesting story, and just the right amount of action. fast forward to version 3, and everything just feels wrong.the opening 10 or 15 minutes pack some interesting story line, decent action, that car crashing through frank's living room wall was incredible. from there the film just goes down hill. the real turning point, frank starts talking to valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuses to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). finally she talks about food at a restaurant. it's foreshadowing, but she does talk about carrots a lot. and sadly the only thought this reviewer and his two sons had was, well does that help her keep her red hair and freckles? sad but true, the movie just completely lost it's way at this point.the action scenes are exciting and pitiful at the same time. the excitment is in the chase and the rapid fire editing, slick cars, beautiful scenery, and pulsating music and sound. the awful part, and this absolutely kills these sequences, so much sped up motion was used as to make these scenes almost stupid. sped up and slo-mo fighting scenes were tiresome. the worst was the driving on two wheels between the two semi's stunt - plain old, flat out, stupid, defying all laws of physics and the darn cg effect was too obvious. it's a sad movie when the viewer can actually see the light green tint around the edge of the actors in front of a green screen (just about every in car conversation is plagued with this). if the action had been furious enough, the dialog compelling, the story interesting; the green screen effect would have faded away. instead it's out there in the open, made even visible on blu-ray.there's a ton of continuity issues, where things don't match from one scene to the next. frankly, this reviewer has never seen a longer list for any other movie that that internet movie database. t 3 has probably set a record for the most (there are over 30 goofs). natalya rudakova is just not a very good actress, her delivery of lines is flat and almost read from the script. she is not really that beautiful, certainly not somebody that frank should be attracted to. the reviewer found himself noticing the dark marks on her lips, either cold sores or freckles. it's very sad when a lead actress just isn't captivating. jason statham is the only reason this film gets two stars. this is essentially a guy movie, not really a date film. jason taking his shirt off several times, well just wasn't a smart move; it plays to the wrong audience. the fishing scene with the french police inspector is charming. him driving an old renault 6 is also an interesting contrast. the other characters are just flat.the film is rated pg-13. there is no nudity. the f bomb is in a subtitle once. there's plenty of violence, a fair amount of blood, and several times where a person is shown being shot. given that the movie is so bad, it's probably smart to respect the age guideline. blu-ray was a mixed blessing for this film. the sound is incredible. it will excercise your subwoofer. the gun shots and fighting sounds are significantly higher volume than the dialog. the high resolution of blu-ray shows all the bad / cheap cg effects the director chose. on dvd, these might not have been as visible. the blu-ray disc includes some really lame mogolo (apologies for not spelling this correctly) piece of junkware software. it took a good solid 15 minutes (at 12mbps very fast internet connection) to download the program. it appears to allow a person to view a clip of the film, store it, add some graphics, and then share it with others. after step 12 in the demo, this reviewer gave up totally. cr__ware experiments just keep happening with blu-ray. maybe one day soon the authors of this junk will settle down to just show the movie in all it's hidef glory.","transporter be such an amaze film, a real surprise, great timing, interest story, and just the right amount of action. fast forward to version 3, and everything just feel wrong.the open 10 or 15 minute pack some interest story line, decent action, that car crash through frank's live room wall wa incredible. from there the film just go down hill. the real turn point, frank start talk to valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuse to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). finally she talk about food at a restaurant. it's foreshadowing, but she doe talk about carrot a lot. and sadly the only think this reviewer and his two son have was, well doe that help her keep her red hair and freckles?

0,"linksys and all other router manufacturers advertises the greatness of the wireless 5ghz band (especially with 802.11n), but i'm beginning to have my doubts.  it is true that the 5ghz band is hardly being used so you'll have virtually no one to compete with,.  however, the 5ghz distance in no way compares to 2.4ghz, and as a matter of fact, i find it to be quite terribe.  at approximately 20 feet away, both my linksys dma2200 and hp notebooke barely get 1 bar using the 5ghz n band with my wrt610n router.  in comparison, while only using my 2.4ghz wrt54g router, i get 5 full bars at that range, and at least 2 bars from anywhere else in my house. i have all linksys equipment in my house as i have been impressed with all of their 2.4ghz in the past.  however, i've recently upgraded everything to dual-band n equipment and found numerous flaws in each of the new devices, plus none of them really even play well together.  my setup is: linksys 610n router, dma2200 media center extender, and a wusb600n dual-band wireless-n usb network adapter for my laptop - all of which are currently using the most up-to-date firmware. other devices include a wre54g extender and  nintendo wii.problem  #1) the lela software with the new n devices doesn't even recognize that my dma2200 is a media center extender.  using lela, i should be able to select my media extender and allocate more bandwidth for streaming media.  however, since my extender only shows up as an ""unknown network device"" those options are greyed out.  i tried to manually change the device to a media center, but still no go.  i suppose you can manually allocate bandwidth in the router setup somewhere, but considering these are all linksys products, it's absolutely ridiculous that an option specifically incorporated in the lela software for a linksys media extender does not work!!!  problem #2) if you are only using one system with the router, the router might actually work as intended.  for most of us though there are going to be at least 2 or more systems connected to the router (wired, wireless, or a combination of the two) such as a ps3, wii, laptop, pc, media extender, xbox, etc.  if that's the case, you're probably screwed because you will experience frequent dropouts... especially if just one those clients is a vista machine.   check the linksys forums and you will find that this seems to be a problem with all of the new linksyss routers (610n, 310n, and 110).  here is a microsoft article that explains the problem [...] do to a problem with the way vista accepts dhcp requests from certain routers.  unfortunately, there is no real fix for this, even with the suggested registry modification which really doesn't fix the problem.problem #3) because of  problem #2 i will never be able to get rid of the dropouts since my network is using one of linksys's media center extenders.  the dma2200 is essentially a vista pc to some extent and accepts dhcp requests the same as a vista pc.  since it is not really a pc though, there is no registry modification that can be done to alleviate the vista problem (not hat the registry mod really works anyways).  so as long as i try to use my dma2200 wirelessly with my wrt610n router, the frequent dropouts will occur and there's nothing i can do about it.  this is really terrible since the dma2200 is specifically designed to be used with the wrt610n router in order to take advantage of the 5ghz band and wireless n transfer rates.  you absolutely need 5ghz wireless n to effeciently stream hdtv wirelessly, but if you lose your connection every 10 minutes, it is impossible to watch any type of streaming media.problem #4) as mentioned already, when the ""n"" 5ghz range is working on the wrt510n router, the distance sucks compared to standard 2.4ghz g, n or mixed mode networks.  you can try to make it better by strictly using n products, disabling the 2.4ghz band all-to-gether, and using the wider 40mhz frequency, but it doesn't really help.  the higher 5ghz band is a more concentrated signal and therefore simply does not reach as far as the lower 2.4ghz band.  i wonder why all of these new products state that the 5ghz range will increase your distance, when in fact it actually makes it worse?  so... basically, this router does nothing that it claims too and is basically rendered useless on any network with a vista machine.  this has not been addressed by any linksys firmware updates or vista software updates so there is no reason to even consider using this router if you you're using vista or some type of vista media center extender such as the linksys dma2200. although, i've always sworn by linksys in the past, the amount of wasted time, frustration, and horrible support has really changed my view about them.  i've reverted back to my old trustworthy wrt54g router and had to run cable through my house so that i wouldn't have to box my dma2200 extender up and let it collect dust in the attic.

0,"don't buy this if you think your power will ever go out, or you might pull the plug.my hard drive was getting full. i had lots of family photos and music files and various other stuff.  so i bought the western digital 500gb my book and 'moved' 62g of files onto it.  a week later i go to find something and there are no, zero nada files on it.  i do notice that the drive letter shows that there is only 420gb free.  first help person says, did you ever unplug it.  sure i say, afterall it's a hard drive like the one in your pc you should be able to turn off power.  he says oh your data is gone then!!!! i tell him that there must be something on there taking up that space but he doesn't understand me so i ask him to escalate (we're dealing with india now).  finally after several hours and requests to escalate since i know there is data on there, i get a very smart person who understands right away what i am saying regarding only 420gb free, must be data on the drive.  he has me run some sort of scan and it finds all my files!!!! whoohoo right?wrong, it just finds the data, and gives them new filenames like 000001.chk, 000002.chk, 000003.cha and so on for 30,000 files or so.  the help desk guy then sympathises and recommends some software, you can purchase, that will go through all the files and put the correct extensions on them.so hour and days later i have 3,000 .txt files with no names, and 2,000 .jpg files and 5,000 .ppt .... and so on.  now i get to open each one and name it appropriately.do you want to go through this experience?  if you have no fear that your power will ever go out, or you'll accidently pull the plug then go ahead, buy it.i do own a maxtor exernal for my other pc, 2 years now, multiple power downs and no data loss.","don't buy this if you think your power will ever go out, or you might pull the plug.my hard drive wa get full. i have lot of family photo and music file and various other stuff. so i buy the western digital 500gb my book and 'moved' 62g of file onto it. a week later i go to find something and there be no, zero nada file on it. i do notice that the drive letter show that there be only 420gb free. first help person says, do you ever unplug it. sure i say, afterall it's a hard drive like the one in your pc you should be able to turn off power. he say oh your data be go then!!!! i tell him that there must be something on there take up that space but he doesn't understand me so i ask him to escalate (we're deal with india now). finally after several hour and request to escalate since i know there be data on there, i get a very smart person who understand right away what i be say regard only 420gb free, must be data on the drive. he ha me run some sort of scan and it find all my files!!!! whoohoo right?wrong, it just find the data, and give them new filename like 000001.chk, 000002.chk, 000003.cha and so on for 30,000 file or so. the help desk guy then sympathise and recommend some software, you can purchase, that will go through all the file and put the correct extension on them.so hour and day later i have 3,000 .txt file with no names, and 2,000 .jpg file and 5,000 .ppt .... and so on. now i get to open each one and name it appropriately.do you want to go through this experience? if you have no fear that your power will ever go out, or you'll accidently pull the plug then go ahead, buy it.i do own a maxtor exernal for my other pc, 2 year now, multiple power down and no data loss.",thin your ill hard hot stern boo free first like able ace understand finally very smart right wrong just new pat commend soft rough correct open appropriately prop want to fear that

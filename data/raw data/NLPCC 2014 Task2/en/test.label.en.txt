The collar hardly ever fires even when my dog is barking her head off. I installed a new battery, I positioned it on her according to the instructions, and still it doesn't work.  I intend to contact the manufacturer and request an exchange under warranty just to see if I got a defective unit.

Totally great!  Easy installation, very very nice quality.  Very good price for what you get.  Keeps my two boxers from rushing to the front door to greet the guests.   Especially for the two three year old grandkids that don't really like the kisses from the Boxers.

As a fan of the first three books, particularly Eclipse, I truly anticipated Breaking Dawn. Now I wish that I had stopped with Eclipse and left Bella and Edward's future to my imagination.While I don't think Breaking Dawn warrants 1 star, there are too many problems with the plot, consistency, characters and overall writing for me to justify awarding more than 2 stars. After reading the various Q&A's Stephenie gave after Breaking Dawn's release, I can begrudgingly overcome some of these problems, but there are too many others, including a monumentally disappointing final "battle."*Spoilers!*  This is one long novel--not just in page count, but in terms of readers' patience, as well. Perhaps if it was split into two novels, the author could spend more time incorporating explanations for problematic plot twists--Renesme?--and strengthening character development rather than explaining herself endlessly after the book's publication. I didn't feel an overall arc to the plot--rather, this was like hitting key points in Bella's life (here's where she got married, where she first had sex, where she got pregnant, where she gave birth and was transformed, where she hunted, ad infinitum). There wasn't any thread throughout until partway through Book Three, when the !Volturi! threat began---and fizzled out.The wedding was disappointing; I would have expected far more details given the level of anticipation for this event. There's no description of the wedding dress--but there was for Alice's outfit! Renee was a joke--flies in for the day of the wedding, with just enough time to help Bella put some combs in her hair, and that's it? Jasper, the vampire with the most difficulty with humans, picked her and Phil up from the airport? Rose did Bella's hair--with little explanation why she was suddenly nice? Or was this a ham-fisted attempt at foreshadowing their pregnancy partnership?The Volturi were a great addition to the books--the "vampire police" were a fascinating concept and I enjoyed learning more about their backgrounds, operations, and the question of their true motivations where the Cullens/Renesme were concerned. However, the final confrontation was so drawn out it became boring. We learned more about them before the confrontation than we did during the confrontation itself. Finally, when it looked like the payoff would take place (Renesme and Jacob run-off; everyone declares their last words of love), Alice swoops in with another half-vamp and Aro says "my bad, nothing to see here, move on!" Everyone cheers and leaves, yet don't we suspect that the Volturi will somehow exact revenge on the witnesses? It's all very unresolved and unsatisfying.Also problematic in Book Three is the sudden introduction of a plethora of new vampires and superpowers. While it's exciting to witness more interaction with the Denali clan, it's difficult to keep everyone straight (thus the index--maybe that should have been a sign!). Book Three is a dramatic departure from everything before: a new major character (Renesme) and tens of new minor characters; SuperVampBella who behaves opposite of human Bella; half the characters have some type of superpower they practice with each other; all the rules are changing (Bella's "private mind" can be breached by Renesme; newborns don't really need to be so bloodthirsty; werewolves are really shapeshifters; packs can break apart, reform, communicate, not communicate in whatever fashion is convenient for the plot; etc.), Charlie's okay with all the supernatural weirdness; there are several half-breeds alive, if you just know where to look; etc.I expected Bella to change in obvious and less-obvious ways after becoming a vampire, but almost nothing of human Bella continued in SuperVampireBella. It's not enough that her clumsiness is gone now that everything physical is easy; Bella is extraordinarily beautiful, has what turns out to be the most helpful superpower in the confrontation by extending it out to everyone she wishes, can let Edward into her thoughts, has almost no insecurities anymore, can easily and smoothly charm a lawyer, and has perfect self-control from day one.I know we're to buy that because Bella has mentally prepared to become a vegetarian vampire she can go without the typical newborn process, but she goes to Carlisle lengths, and Carlisle is to be extraordinary among vampires. She doesn't twitch or cry out in pain during her transformation, she stops mid-first hunt and runs away from human temptation--a feat Edward claims even mature vampires sometimes can't do, and can balance her "distractions" (i.e., need for blood, sex) from the very first day--a process that Edward, again, claims often takes years to achieve. Bella even learns to manipulate and extend her superpower in a very short amount of time. So easy for her--no true obstacles, she just rationally decides how she wants it to be, and makes it so. Not only is Bella unrelatable because she is no longer human, she's not even a particularly relatable vampire!After all the build-up over concerns about moving to Alaska and avoiding people, bets on casualties, etc., Bella is "herself" and in perfect control of her bloodlust, plus the nifty bonus that she still wants Edward above all desires from the very moment he kisses her. No more mentions of Edward's concern about damned souls or lost humanity, no real mourning over losing face-to-face contact with Renee--after all, she has Charlie again! So, where's the drama? Oh, right, with the Volturi. And all they needed was a group of SuperFriends and a deuce ex-machina in the form of a South American vampire/human.Charlie wasn't himself--since when does a chief of police not know how to get info from the CDC? Jake transforms in front of him (and isn't that a big no-no? some of the werewolves' parents don't even know!) and he takes it calmly--just don't tell him more than he needs to know! Again, he's the chief of police--yes, he's always overlooked many things he doesn't really want to think about, but doesn't he have some concern about public safety, what with huge wolves around?And what about those "werewolves?" After the massive build-up and tension in Book Two over the pack split, a quick sentence or two from Bella reveals that suddenly everyone is happy again  because Jake imprinted on Renesme. All the discord in LaPush and among the werewolves and between Sam's pack and the Cullens is brushed away like it never really happened. So happy is everyone, in fact, that Sam and Jake can communicate telepathically, but only what they want, when they want. Convenient. Also, why the big reveal that they are actually "shapeshifters?" What purpose does that serve? It's random and unsettling, dropped in just at the end of the story.The writing itself was subpar: vague, little variety in adjectives, poor grammar and spelling, stale dialogue. Bella doesn't stop to reflect on her experiences or behavior. Book Two sloshes through repetitive mush of how much physical pain Bella is in, how much psychological pain Jake and Edward are in, how dangerous the situation is, etc. Throughout Books Two and Three, conversations tend to drag on, particularly between the wolves, yet by the end, there's little discussion between Bella and Edward of their new reality as parents and how it has presumably changed their relationship.Finally, as many have mentioned, there is the problem of the ending itself. I'm all for happy endings, but we've been told in these novels for so long that there will be consequences to Bella's choices. There's absolutely no realism left by Book Three, no satisfying payoff to the Volturi conflict, and then Bella ends up with everything she could possibly want, with no compromises, no consequences, and nothing negative for any of the Forks/LaPush crowd.In the end, there were a few scenes that worked for me--Isle Esme, the birth, the transformation, the final scene with Bella and Edward---but not enough to rise above a meager 2-star review.

I purchased this router a little over a month ago.  Since using it, it has significantly slowed the pace at which I am able to surf the internet.  I called Linksys to try to solve tis and was on the phone with tech support for 90 minutes while he tried to solve the issue and even remotely controlled my computer to adjust the settings.  He said my router was bad and needed to be replaced.  He said to call customer service with my case number to have this done.  When I called back, there was no record of my call with the tech support and they asked me to call back in 30-90 minutes to give the computer time to upload the tech guy's notes.  I called back two hours later and was transferred between 10 different people only to find out that there still were no notes and thus they would have to start again to diagnose my problem.  This took an entire day and it is still unresolved.  Linksys should be ashamed of their customer service.  It is terrible.

I've now bought two of these Waterpiks, and each one broke within a month. The nozzle assembly seems of very poor quality. In both cases, as I was using the waterpik, the nozzle simply came apart. I can't believe that more people haven't had this problem, but in any case, I am now looking for a better quality product. I would not recommend this to anyone.

This espresso maker works just as I expected: Perfectly fine.  It's simple and intuitive.  It works fine for pulling 1-2 shots at a time.  The reheat cycle is about a minute, so if you're making more, by the time you clean out the spent grounds and reload, the machine is ready for you.  After making 1-2 shots, the machine needs about 2 minutes to get the steamer ready.  The steamer works well.  Complaints about the wand height and length are apparently from people who insist on using whatever milk pot they have rather than one that fits.  Not having one, I've been using my Pyrex 1-cup measuring cup which works well.  I froth 1/3 cup milk which becomes a full (overflowing) cup of steamed milk and some foam.  End result?  Tasty espresso with good cream, and lattes or cappuccino with little fuss.  I'm quite happy with this under $100 machine.  It's perfect for 1-2 people who don't drink tons of espresso.  It's also pretty quiet and cleans up easily.  Daily use for about a month.

The workout is definitely tough. It takes time to learn choreography. I got my DVD yesterday and so far I've learned the first combination (took me about an hour to be comfortable with it and do it up to speed with Tracy, and I do not have any dance background). I did notice that the arm movements in actual performance of the combination in the first combo are different from the moves Tracy teaches, but once you are familiar with the rest of the combo you'll not find it difficult to learn the proper arm movements. The workout is very fun! And I love the fact that she doesn't talk throughout the actual workout. I had been doing Jillian Michaels routine prior to getting Tracy's DVD's, and to be honest, after the first couple of weeks of Jillian I knew each word she was gonna say and exact second of when she'll say it. It became boring and I felt like I was in the army. Tracy's workout is very different and makes you feel like a woman! I feel sexy doing it. I can't wait to learn all the combo's and I'm up for the challenge! I can barely do the first combo making sure it lasts the whole song. I am in a pretty good shape, because I ran 10km every single day! This workout is tough but I fell in love with it from the moment I put it on!

I bought this DVD thinking that it would be tailored for very overweight people since it is a "Biggest Loser" workout, but I could hardly do any of it. And worse was that he did the same poses OVER AND OVER AND OVER! So I kept thinking I might be able to do the next pose and then he'd do the same thing again...boring! So I didnt even get a workout cause I could hardly do it. Ive also heard bad things about the other Biggest Loser workouts so I wont be investing in them anymore...Tae-bo is still the best!!!

I have a Linksys BEFSR41 wired router, so when I started bringing my wireless work laptop home, I decided that I needed to get a wireless access point rather than another (wired/wireless)router. Basic setup was simple; I was up and running in ten minutes with the very basic documentation. I am a pc tech for a hospital, so I have more than the ordinary skill needed to configure the WAP. Even so, I downloaded the docs from Linksys' site to be sure that I'd done everything properly. I hadn't. While I'd set the encryption, I hadn't turned off brodcasting the access point's name. A really good hacking program could have gotten access.Definitely download the documentation from Linksys' site.

I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by these wipes! With a new baby in the house, we went thru several brands of sensitive wipes (Pampers, Huggies, Target generic and Kirtlands). I found these wipes to be stronger and hold their moisture better than any of the other brands we tried. Overall they are a better performing product than any of the other wipes.  My only comment is that buyers should not expect the wipes to be as strong as wipes made for older babies or toddler.  However, we like them so much we have started using them on our toddler. Though it is a matter of personal opinion (and after becoming more educated on the topic) we feel that the lack of fragrance, synthetic ingredients and a lower impact on the environment is worth the switch.

I bought this product two weeks ago from a major retailer.  I was admittedly dazzled by the huge harddrive space, and my intention was to rip my entire CD collection to high quality MP3 format and save everything to this device.  I have no interest in buying music and videos directly from Zune's store or trading files via WiFi.  I had already converted much of my CD collection to MP3 in Windows Media Player in preparation of bringing home my Zune.My first disappointment with the Zune 120 gb was that I couldn't do a single thing with it until I installed its accompanying software to my computer.  This is not a 'plug and play' appliance.  One feature I that really like about my Sansa Fuze is that it automatically synchs with Windows Media Player, a program that is already on my computer.  After I installed the Zune software I discovered that it required an additional update to be downloaded and installed.In general I don't like the Zune software.  It tries to take over as the default media software on your computer; it tries to gather information about you to send back to Zune; the interface is awkwardly designed and lacks explanation; the program is full of bugs.  The Zune software immediately found every music and video file on my computer and added it to its library, sometimes multiple times, whether I wanted them there or not.  Furthermore, I couldn't delete unwanted items from the Zune manager's library.  Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't clear these unwanted items, and I never did figure out where the software stores this information.I installed all the MP3s I had ripped with Media Player to the Zune device and continued ripping CDs with Zune's software.  The Zune's ripping program was noticeably slower.  The only reason I even chose to rip with the Zune software at all was because it kept popping up everytime I inserted a CD, and closing Zune's program and opening Media Player each time simply became a hassle.When I decided to sit back and enjoy the music I had loaded on my Zune, I was able to play several songs I had ripped with Media Player without any problem.  Then I selected a song I had ripped with the Zune software.  The Zune immediately went dead without any warning.  I couldn't turn the device back on, and plugging the USB cord into it didn't revive it.  I tried letting it charge for several hours but the Zune remained inert.  I took it back to store the next day.  The customer service representative told me that another Zune 120 gb had just came back with the same problem I had experienced.  I accepted a full refund and didn't look back.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I am 35yr old mother of two.  I LOVED THIS BOOK.  This isn't the normal type of book i read at all.  I bought this book within hours of finishing Twilight.  It was fantastic.  Not a disappointment at all.  It is so well written that i could feel physical pain for the way Bella suffered in the book.  I have read it twice in two weeks.  I am on pins and needles waiting for the next in the series... in the mean time i will re-read Romeo and Juliette.  Fall 2007 will not come soon enough.If you enjoyed this as much as i have, go to the authors website for more.. she has extras and outtakes that didn't make it into the book.  It prolongs the joy of reading this just a bit longer.Thank you Stephenie for sharing a great talent.

This is just one of many Blu-Ray movies that i have purchased that has given me a great movie experience, personally i feel that even in the movie theaters you don't get the HD experience that a Blu-Ray movie gives you. The Transformers movie gives you an awsome look at how much detail you can see because of the HD quality. You can actually see the littlest of details in the mechanics of the different moving parts in the robots. Just awesome!! Also the prompt delivery of your product, amazon will let you know the approximate date of delivery and will probably get there before the date of arrival. All in all i have had a great experience with Amazon.

Replacement blades don't really seem to help that much on other electric razors I have used.  But, the Braun instructions say to replace the foil and cutter every 18 months.  When I finally replaced mine (22 months) it was amazing how much better the razor worked.  It was really like getting a new razor.  It runs much smoother and slip along my aging skin like silk again.  If you have one of these Braun razors and find it is not a smooth and comfortable as it once was, the Foil and Cutter refill may do the trick for you.

After years of hearing this graphic novel lauded as one of the greatest comics of all time (and admittedly intrigued by the buzz surrounding the upcoming film adaptation), I finally sat down and read Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' magnum opus.  And I was blown away.  Absolutely, completely enthralled and blown away by this "comic book" that transcends the boundaries and stigmas attached to its medium to become a truly compelling piece of literature, as stimulating and thought provoking as the works of Dickens or Faulkner.I should point out that while I have always been a fan of superheroes, I am not an avid comic book reader; in fact, "Watchmen" is the first graphic novel I've ever purchased.  I state this to illustrate that this is a work that can be enjoyed by anyone, not just comic book enthusiasts.  Everything about this book, even 20+ years after its original publication, is thrillingly fresh and compelling.  Set in an alternate 1985 where Richard Nixon is serving his third term as president, one of the novel's many pleasures is seeing just how thoroughly thought out every aspect of this alternate history is.  The story begins with the murder of a former masked hero (the book fittingly avoids the term "superhero," as only one of the characters has supernatural abilities), and what starts as a whodunit quickly escalates into a meditation on power, government, politics, technology, and the direction humanity is headed.  Yes, the Cold War-era nuclear-holocaust material slightly dates the tale, but the theme of mankind's ever growing ability to destroy ourselves is still relevant today.Yet for all its philosophizing, "Watchmen" remains firmly grounded in character study, and the costumed adventurers found withing are given incredibly complex psychologies.  Everyone is a realistically flawed human being doing their best to figure out their place in the world.  By the novel's end, you come to understand all the characters, even the ones who have done the most horrific things (including an attempted rape and some graphic murders).  Moore and Gibbons do not pass judgment on their characters, leaving the reader to ultimately decide how he or she feels about each one.The way the narrative is told is absolutely riveting, filled with flashbacks and concurrent scenes juxtaposed to maximum artistic effect.  And in between each chapter is a wealth of supplemental materials to fill in the gaps of the novel's backstory, each done in the fashion of  publications that exist in the Watchmen world (newspaper clippings, excerpts from fake novels, etc.).  And artist Dave Gibbons expertly supports Moore's text with detailed artwork packed with symbolism and hidden meanings.  You could easily spend hours pouring over the panels to find small symbolic details and hints of future plot twists.  The final panel alone masterfully and succintly brings the work full-circle and is chilling in its implications.In short, anyone who is a fan of literature (not just comic books) needs to read "The Watchmen."  While I have high hopes for the film adaptation, it cannot hope to match the complexity, breadth, and depth of the source material.  This is one of the most stimulating books I have read in a long time, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

I originally had a Brookstone pedometer that was not accurate at all (like for every 1 step, it counted 2-3), so someone told me about this one and I ordered it right away. It is soooooooooooooooo accurate. For the whole day, it might be off by like a few steps, but nothing to worry about. The only thing I dont like about it is that it is huge compared to other pedometers, but I would rather have it big and accurate than not. I would definitely recommend this pedometer to everyone.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      

The HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions lack the "110 minutes of 'behind the scene' footege" + a documentary entitled "Planet Earth -- The Future". Full descriptions of these from amazon's websites are as follows:"DVD Features:110 minutes of behind the scenes footage - one 10-minute behind the scenes program for each episode (SD release only)Documentary:Planet Earth - The Future: This 3-part, 2 1/2 hour series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and -- ultimately -- ourselves. Following the environmental issues raised by Planet Earth, it asks why so many species are threatened and how they can be protected in future. (SD release only)"My friend bought the DVD set as a gift, and we started to watch this extraordinarily exceptional documentary series. Among all other things, the part that we most liked was those "behind the scene footages" because there are some utterly and literally unbelievable scenes captured that make you wonder how they were captured, and after each episode these footages tell you about the techniques used for videotaping. As a frequent documentary watcher, I was really puzzled with how these series were videotaped, and the footages shed light to many things.Since I liked this series very much, I went to BestBuy and quarelled with a sales associate for the exhange of this DVD set with the Blu-ray one. Eventually I win, but when I came to my apartment, ultimately she won, because the footages were missing in the Blu-ray edition!!!BBC, first and foremost, what made you think that Blu-ray player owners do not require or less require the bonus feautres??Second, if you ever had to consider whether DVD player owners or Blu-ray player owners less need the bonus feautres, then how come you voted against the latter?? After all the bonus feautres constantly praise how you videotaped in HD!!As to the narrators, I have not watched the series on TV, nevertheless I share the same opinion with others, as a non-American.Why are you compelling these guys to watch the series in British English. I could respec`t your decision if you had sticked to British English for the TV broadcasting. But broadcasting with a U.S. narrator and then releasing the DVD with a Brit narrator is simply deceiving people.Anyhow, for the prospective buyers I will, irrespective of the HD quality, recommend the DVD set instead of Blu-ray. Believe me, the DVD series was also very nice. Not to mention that another reviewer comments that the visual quality on this Blu-ray is far worse than the then TV broadcasting. He relies his facts on the encoding. I don't know whether he is true or not, but it is better to consider his comments as well.

The player works pretty much as advertised, but the lack of documentation in the package was staggering.Such instructions as there are assume that you are ripping CDs into a Windows Media library - and then synchronizing the Sansa device from that program (2 weeks ago I would not even have understood the previous sentence).My musical relationship is with RHAPSODY - and so getting the M250 to work with that web site was pretty much a matter of trial and error.But - 4 days from the time that the M250 arrived on my doorstep - I had my music loaded.You pay more for the NANO - but loading music from iTunes has to be easier than my experience.My last concern focuses on the number of songs which the product packaging says this device will hold. Using WMA compression, Sansa claims up to 960 songs.I guess that's 960 songs, with each song lasting about a minute. Loading normal, progressive-rock-type material I am carrying a little over 300 tunes.

I loved the 3 twilight books... believed everything fantastical about the story- until they brought Nessie the abomination in. This is not a book to tie the loose ends. This is a book about Nessie.The point of the Twilight Series was about Bella and Edward's love story. Bringing in a BABY should not even be part of the equation. WHAT WAS MS. MEYER THINKING?!?!?!?!The only redeeming parts of this book was the wedding and part of the honeymoon. I also enjoyed the part where Bella is discovering her new abilities. Other than that, its a messy story,and with too many small things happening. I was disappointed that Bella and Edward did not destroy their house after nights of passion (I thought their love was epic.)Stephenie tried to make the readers love Nessie- but like I said. How can anyone fall in love with Nessie the Abomination???? AND how could Stephenie bear to have Jake imprint on her?!?!?!The magic is gone.

My husband and I paid a breathtaking $100 for this coffee maker when they were fairly new on the market. Once every 6 months it would plug up and spew water all over the counter when it was supposed to be brewing coffee in the morning. Cleaning it was a nightmare (take it, turn it upside down over the sink and irrigate it until some tiny coffee ground dislodged from it's guts). My husband and I spent hours getting the coffee pot to work again. The entire thing is due to some really stupid engineering. You don't fix it up so that the ground regularly plug up the water reservior. This morning was the last straw. I took it outside and threw it against the concrete walkway behind my house and watched gleefully as the wretched thing exploded into plastic and bent aluminum pieces. I can truly say that was the most satisfaction that object ever delivered to me.I am going out today and buying a decent brand of coffee maker and never ever wasting my money on Cuisinart again. By the way, my Cuisinart food processor broke recently because the safety catch on the top lid came off right at the spot I predicted it would break. I knew that there would be too much stress on a thin and small part...guess what, I was right. So, from my experience, Cuisinart is just an expensive name. Go out and get a Hamilton Beach food processor or a Kitchen Aid coffee maker.

I typically don't write reviews, especially the low-score one, but I felt I have the obligation to tell this to everyone.It's a nightmare, my 2-month old MacBook pro dead. I used to have IBM thnkpad T-series notebook (now Lenovo) and it was great compare to this Mac in terms of reliability. I can carry the IBM thinkpad to work in the morning and bring it back to home in the evening without power down for SEVERAL weeks, there was no issue at all. I thought I was little rough to the thinkpad so I power down this Mac everyday after the work, carefully carry it around, well, when it happens, it happens, all the sudden, it dies. I'm in the process to recover the data, I'm mad. I'll update the review later for the service experience, so far not very good either.Another issus is you can't fold down the screen compeletedly outwards, it will break it. Bad design, image accidentaly you push down the screen for better view angle and you could break it and that's not covered by warranties. Regardless how great the MacBook is, it's a great pain when your working computer dies, you need get it repaired, resintall the application, recover the data if possible, and re-do all your work if data is lost, what about the photos you took for the special moment yesterday that haven't upload yet... too bad.No, I don't want anything fancy, I just need a reliable PC to do my things (paper, dissertation, spreadsheet, make movies), which all PCs on the market can do.

I purchased this to replace a 5 section rotating feeder that I used when I was away from home.  I consider my cat bulemic, especially when left home alone, he will overeat and then I come home to multiple piles of wet kitty kibble...  This product has solved these issues.The feeder holds plenty of food for multiple feedings.  The adjustable settings go from to 1/4 to 2 cups per feeding and allows 1 to 3 feedings per day at times you set.  The base is heavy enough (add the batteries before you judge) to keep my cat from tipping it or moving it.The controls are a little tough to get use to, reminiscent of a digital multifunction wristwatch, so hold on to your directions.Overall, I would recommend this product to others.  This is feeder number 3 for me and paying the higher price has solved many of the problems of cheaper units.

After spending over 3 hours trying to download the installer software, then downloading MS updates and installing them per Amazon's help desk instuctions, I still couldn't download the Turbotax software I purchased.  If you want to take a chance on spending hours trying to download it, go ahead and purchase this software from Amazon.  If not, spend $20 more, pick it up at Walmart, and use the 2.5 hours remaining to actually do your taxes.

I have had the WRT310N for several months now.  I am already on my 2nd unit having replaced the original one under warranty within 6 weeks.  The problems with both are the same.At random intervals, the router's web configuration is inaccessible to any device on the network.  The router will respond to a ping request for a period of time.  Eventually pinging to the router fails.  When that happens, Only those systems that have static IP's can communicate with one another.  Anything with a dynamic IP, either wired or wireless is unable to communicate with any other device.  As I stated above, I am currently using a warranty replacement which is exhibiting the same problems as the unit I purchased originally.  Linksys tech support is essentially a joke but I've known that a long time.  Their "analysts" do nothing more than read scripts that guide you through steps I've done several times before calling them.  I am sure they can help someone who is much less technically inclined but the only thing they can do is provide me with a warranty replacement.After reading some posts here and in the Linksys message boards, I see I am not alone with this problem.  Upgrading the firmware was of no help either.  I might not mind it as much if the router was not in a room in my basement where I rarely spend time.  Sadly it looks as though I will have to invest in another device unless Linksys can find a cause and a solution first, the prospects for which I have very little hope.

My husband and I got our first Sonicare over 10 years ago and it is still going strong.  We've always kept our brushes in the charger plugged in and have never had a problem.  On vacations we take it with us and it has always worked fine.I feel we certainly have had our money's worth.  We've used the it so much that the Sonicare name has worn off the unit.  I know one of these days it will bite the dust but we will definitely buy another, probably this model.  I feel the Sonicare does an excellent job of cleaning the teeth & gums.  Our oral health has much improved since those years of using a regular toothbrush.  We highly recommend the Sonicare.  Skyland

I purchased this "waterproof collar" to assist in training my dog.  He learned quickly that the tone was immediately followed by a shock if whatever behavior he was exhibiting did not stop.  Sadly, I have a dog that enjoys the sprinkler system....and I found out that the collar was not waterproof.  I now found myself out $130.00 for a training collar that only lived about two months.I contacted PetSafe and braced myself for a fight while attempting to get them to honor their "Lifetime Warrantee," but was pleasantly surprised that they were both responsive and courteous.  The support employee on the phone immediately stated that he was not comfortable with trying to repair a unit that had been wet on the interior, and he immediately shipped a new unit with a return postage label for the broken unit.While I do not think this product is everything it could be, the warrantee and the support from PetSafe motivated me to change my initial rating from 2 stars to four.

This really seems to help my maltese's eyes.  The reddish tearing has pretty much stopped.  The only problem is that she does not like the taste, so she won't eat it sprinkled on her food.

I use external hard drives for every Apple Macintosh computer I have (4) for backup. Always purchased IOMEGA and never a single hitch using their products.  I continually need larger backup drives and found this Lacie on Amazon at a great price.  Took it out of the box and hooked it up. Tried using Carbon Copy Cloner and SuperDuper! -- writes for short time -- stops.  Contacted Lacie tech support. They gave me a great detailed instruction on how to partition the drive, but nothing works. I now use the Lacie as a storage drive where I just drag and drop. I am back to IOMEGA for a larger drive.

My husband comes from a long line of crepe makers so I got this appliance for his birthday.  At first he rolled his eyes at it (as a purist who likes to flip).  With two little girls, though, we found the play value of this crepe maker to be great.  It's so easy to use, he actually brought it to the dining room table so he could eat while he cooked.  When we had guests, he had this machine going, along with two stove-top pans.  He could make crepes 2-3x faster with this machine versus the stove top.  The crepes are thinner using this method, but that didn't seem to be a problem.  Only thing I'd change about this product would be to make the dipping pan of something other than plastic.  I kept feeling paranoid that I'd melt the plastic when I dipped the hot pan into it.  Overall, though, I'd highly recommend this product.  In fact, we're buying it as a Christmas present for each of my husband's siblings.

From day one, back in late August 2006, I've had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn't work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it.

the amazon.com price for this product is roughly around 25-30 USand the amazon.ca price is 59.99 that is horribly off because it is a 60 day card which provides the user with 2 months of gameplay (without a gamecard it would cost around 15 a month on a credit card) this gamecard should cost around 35 - 40$and another thing is gamecards can't be used because once the code is put in the card becomes useless.

First and formost, I am an avid reader of most things.  I was introduced begrudgingly to this series through a friend and the upcoming movie.  Upon beginning Twilight, I was sucked in rather hard.  New Moon though, I found to be a different kind of book.  Please understand, this review is personal, and I understand that many may not have recieved the pain I did upon reading it. The book itself is well done; the dialogue is consistent, there are fewer errors in the book (minus the name change of a minor character), there's a bit more action and less personal reflection on the perfection of Edward.  The role of Jacob is necessary, and well written.  He fulfills all the parts required of him.  However, the conclusion of the book is what causes me pain.  For those who have felt the loss and betrayal of a lover-particularly one you see yourself with permanently, the damage Edward does to Bella is truly unforgivable.  Her willingness to forgive and forget is unrealistic.  Of course, as a fictional character, she is allowed to respond however she wants.  And of course, as Meyer designed, she places everyone's need above her own.  I must hand it to Meyer though, the description of Bella's pain is exceptionally accurate.  The most upsetting part of the book is also the simplest: only one word was needed per page.I am worried though, that the young female readers will recieve a heightened damsel complex, expecting their mate to respond to them without vocalization, and that this kind of betrayal (despite Edward's intentions) is acceptable.  The type of pain Bella goes through for him is too realistic for me to accept the unrealistic conclusion.  I look forward though, to continuing the saga to its conclusion.

Stopped working a month after I got. Warning: it is not under warranty unless you buy it from a salon. It cost me $35 to have it fixed, plus the cost of shipping it to Farouk's repair center. So not worth it. Also, it is a step up from a drugstore iron, but still highly overrated.

I started having problems backing up my work. I called the support number and got somebody in another country. She must have been reading from a script because she paid little attention to what I was trying to tell her. She spent almost 10 minutes trying to get me to pay for what was supposed to be free help. Finally, I got a supervisor on the line whose English did not have such a strong accent. In just a few minutes, he explained what the other tech was trying to get me to do to resolve the issue I was having in backing up my work. No help. Just renaming the program index is not a solution. I am searching for a new program to replace Quiken Deluxe 2009.

I eagerly anticipated this book along with thousands of others... but in the  end it did not live up to my expectations.  Basically books 1-3 were wonderful and believable even though the subject matter was so supernatural, the characters connected and the plot line was interesting... this book was of a totally different feeling.  It was almost 100% focused on the supernatural which made it feel unbelievable. And the plot line was outrageously ridiculous but at the same time boring.1. It felt like the characters were suddenly empty... without the same amount of depth as in the other three books.2. Events were too "convenient"3. It felt like rising action, rising action, rising action - then NO CLIMAX.  Like a blockbuster kung-fu movie without the big final fight at the end. Not that I really wanted people to die, but come on!! It could have been amazing if they actually  fought and defeated the Volturi etc.Maybe I'll have to make up my own ending...

You get two, which could last up to a year.  Not bad, the price is right, I've seen these at membership stores for $17.00.  You'll need them.  For extra cleaning, dip your loaded toothbrush into a cup of baking soda, it's a gentle abrasive and aids in bringing the teeth up.  Sure makes the teeth feel clean.  If you have a 50 year mouth (like mine) and have taken coffee and tea for many moons, a professional whitening may be in order but I'm not laying out a grand for the procedure.  I'm into the hygeine aspect of sonic care, and sonic care really does take care of teeth and gums.  Gums are often over brushed and wear down or neglected altogether, so remember...Sonic care for health, and looks.  But there is a point in life when you either accept the aging and yellow hue or shell out some cash for a cosmetic cleaning procedure.

It's a cool looking quiet drive + it is priced reasonably. Also, while it was working with our Direct TV HD receiver, I was a happy customer. Then, after just 1 month, it died taking all our recorded shows & movies to the zone of "no return". The lights are still on, they even go from red to violet and then blue - yes, very entertaining and pretty ;), but the drive is unrecognizable. I bought a new eSATA cable, I rebooted my HD receiver numerous times, (not suspecting that a drive can possibly fail just after 1 month), I tested it on 2 different computers w XP OS & Vista + I used 2 different types of connections: USB and eSATA, but both computers failed to see the drive. The worst part about this experience, (besides wasting money, energy & time) is non-existent AcomData's customer support.Try calling (909) 786-4280. You have to press 1 for a technical support. Then every minute you will be prompted to press 1 again in order to continue to wait for the next agent, otherwise they automatically redirect you to their mailbox. You can't even turn on a speakerphone and do something else while waiting for somebody to show any signs of life at that company, because they want you to act as a monkey by pressing 1 as soon as you hear that their agents are busy helping other customers. Also, 2 times, after I had presses 1 ~ 5-6 times, while waiting for that mysterious customer support, I got disconnected. How more obvious can they be with this system? They could have put *do not disturb* banner on their web page & prerecorded a message, which would say: *we will try to make it very difficult for you to reach us, so hang up right now & thank you for understanding*. Email this company & see how long it will take them to respond, especially if you're requesting RMA number. Very poor customer support, so you're taking a huge risk by buying any drives from them... If your drive breaks, it will take too much time & energy to get a replacement. I still haven't heard back from them & something tells me that it will take forever to receive a working product from them.I would wait before buying anything else from this CA based company. I will stand by my 1-star review for now. I understand that sometimes things break, but when your product is under a warranty, I expect to have it replaced in a prompt manner. If you decide to go forward with this purchase anyway, please back up everything you will be storing on this device.

I ordered this item after my old ceramic iron stopped heating. I heard about the CHI brand and read some great reviews so I decided to give it a try. This iron is well worth its price! When I first got the iron I was concerned about the weight. It was lighter than what I was used to with my old iron, which made me think it was made cheaper and that it would not work as well. I was more wrong than ever! The light weight of this iron makes it very easy to use and it works wonderfully! It heats up very quick and It never takes me more than 10 minutes to get all of my curly hair silky straight! Non-ceramic hair irons that I have used in the past generally did not hold up against humidity, and my hair would be curly again but that will never happen with this iron! I recommend this iron for anyone who is looking for the best hair tools! Also, I suggest protecting your hair with CHI iron guard when using this product.

So, I read the reviews, but we were despirate and bought it anyways.  Ours works great!  Two months in, it doesn't skip their meals, the cats let us sleep past 7 am, and they don't bother us for food.  I'm actually amazed that my one little trouble-maker hasn't figured out how to make the food come out.  The two downfalls I've found are: 1) you can only set one meal size, so you can either have 1/4 cup three times a day or 1/2 cup three times a day, and the one is too little and the other is too much; and 2) you can only set up to 3 feedings a day.  We've made it work, though.  We give them 1/4 cup at 6 am, 12 pm, and 12 am, and then we manually give them 1/4 cup using the feeder at 6 pm.I can honestly say that after reading the reviews, I was afraid it was going to be a lemon, but if you don't mind making some compromises, I think it is an excellent item, esp for feeding when you want to sleep!  The programming wasn't so hard, and once you figure it out, it's easy to remember.

Like other reviewers here we had this kettle around 12 months only before it died.  On average we probably used it 2-3 times a day to boil water for hot tea and a coffee press.  We weren't unhappy with it while it worked but one day it just died - seems like some kind of electrical issue as the power socket it was plugged into showed signs of overheating (browning, slight melt etc.).  If it only lasts a year that's very poor - there are much better options I believe - we replaced it with a T-Fal and so far have been very happy with that (plus it seems to boil faster than the Chef's Choice).

I heard alot about this product so I tried it.  About a hour after giving it to my dog he started licking his feet until they were really wet.  He didn't like it in his food and wouldn't try it again later.

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)
      

This film continues to be the standard against which all animation is measured. To think of all the hours spent in producing all the hand-drawn perfection seen in this film is staggering. Equal notice should be taken of the exceptional score and songs, themselves award-winning. &quot;When You Wish Upon A Star&quot; is so universally known today, one tends to forget it came from this film.The story of Pinnochio, the little wooden puppet given life for Geppeto the toy maker by the Blue Fairy is well-known. The intensity of the artwork and the tenseness of the story make it immortal. To be honest, very little children should watch with a parent, as some scenes are pretty scary, but I absolutely adore this film.Looking at the film today, it's so hard to believe it's over 60 years old! The picture transfer is flawless, and the soundtrack is superb. I do regret one thing: the complete lack of extras on this disc. One would think such an important film to the Disney studios would have been given more of a send-off to DVD, but really that's all I didn't like about the disc.Please, pay no attention to the lack of extras, just get the DVD for the film itself. Believe me, it's so very worth it!

Unfortunately, I believed most of the reviews and purchased this product. Not very happy with the product and I am now back to purchase a battery or rechargable one. This might be a nice extra one to have for traveling, but doesn't really do a good job and sometimes it hurts. Motorized ones are so much easier to use.

This pedometer works very well.  It accurately tracks my steps as well as aerobic steps.  I like the functions it has.  The 7 day history is great.  The only flaw is that the clip on the end of the strap does not stay on well.  So I don't even use it.  Overall, it is a great product.

This has 4 or 5 stars from almost everyone, but I'll inject a coupleof caveats.  I'd have given it 2 stars if it had been $100 rather than$50.Both ours and my sisters are loud.  It sounds like the motor/bearings arevery cheap.  The KitchenAid one that works with your mixer is quieter.The KitchenAid is $69 for just the bowl, but I'd definitely chooseit over this one IF you already have a mixer.The bowl is breakable.  kitchenaid one has heavier plastic outside.Capacity isn't huge.  Kitchenaid does about 2 qts.  For most of the recipes we've done, the Cuisinart ends up overflowing after it's churned.However, for $50, it's great for making ice cream with the kids or theoccasional bowl of something special.  Much better than the old tubwith ice and salt that I remember from the 70's.  (but man, did that ice cream taste good after you waited for it for HOURS)

Bought this as a Christmas gift for myself off Amazon last December.  Used it a few times, and then had to stop--the shift from shaving to epilating created a GIGANTIC ingrown hair (!) problem.It's been over a year since I bought the machine, and about 8 months since I stopped using it.  I still have healing areas on my legs which are red and angry, and severe scarring--lots of discolored white areas that I'm worried won't return to skin color.I don't know if I have extra sensitive skin or something (would be news to me) but SERIOUSLY consider if the risk is worth it before buying this!  I was excited to save money/hassle, but now I'm embarrassed to wear shorts.  I regret using this.

This is the second year I have purchased Tax Cut for Business - will never do so again.  The program is plagued with glitches, things change without touching them, errors are created for data that isn't even pertinent. No interview available for CA State returns.  It's easier to go to the IRS web site and plug the numbers into their on-line forms.Overall - a truly miserable product.

This is the most impressive brush I have seen.  We have owned others and they were average but this is spectaculor and the dog likes the feel of the brush.  We have removed more hair from her this year than ever before and that means less fur shedding in the house.  It is one of the first things my granddaughters grab when the come to the house to see who will be first to brush the dog. GREAT BUY!

Give it two stars because i assume if you get one in working order it is  a cool, functional gadget.All i wanna say is check the product good before time runs out on a return, the first one we received had an internal scratch on the lens causing a black dot to appear in every video, took awhile to figure that one out! :) The second one we got after returning the first had a hairline crack on the housing of the the usb, this is where alot of the weight is placed when plugged into the pc, so we sent it back and gave up for awhile, like i said, i'm sure it is great if you get one that isn't damaged, glad i ordered from Amazon, made a bad situation a little less aggravating.

The new Battlestar Galactica is one of the most adult and intelligent SF series I have ever seen. Season 2.0 continues the tradition of excellence. It is true that this is relatively expensive compared to the full season 1 (which came with the mini series), but the quality of the storyline makes up for it. A big difference with much SF is that it is more character-driven than plot driven. This makes the show interesting for a broader audience.

With all the junk in the market these days, I'd been dreading the purchase of a new computer for a long while until I found the Lenovo Ideapad S10 "large capacity" model. (Mine's black.) Even though I paid full MSRP, I think it's the best value on the market.My only real complaint is with keyboard layout. I would like to be able to hold the Fn key to use the left and right arrow keys for Home and End, and the up and down arrows for PgUp and PgDn. Given how complete the keyboard is, I'm also surprised that there isn't a "mute" key.For desktop use, I connect a full-size USB keyboard and plug in a monitor, which gives me a second desktop. Having only 2 USB ports is a little tight, especially since I usually keep a Bluetooth adapter in one and a CDMA modem in the other.The Atom and aggressive power management perform well for only a 3-cell battery, giving me usually about 2 hours of use on a full charge. I often use my S10 in my car (and with the addition of a Velco strip, it sits on my Subaru's cup holder), giving me music, Internet email and Web (via a USB CDMA modem), GPS, etc.; on longer trips, I plug the AC adapter into a small inverter. I'm also pleased to see that there's a third-party 6-cell battery available on Amazon.Windows XP comes installed, but erroneously indicates two processors, though it's really just due to the hyperthreading ability of the one Atom N270 processor. I'm a little annoyed that Lenovo did not include a Windows XP installation CD (even though the S10 has not CD drive), but haven't yet called them for one. (I find that Windows often requires re-installation.)The 160GB HDD is a Hitachi (my favorite brand, and not surprising since Lenovo and Hitachi are both effectively ex-IBM). The overhead and one-touch restore feature leave only about 100 GiB usable, which is still plenty, even after installing Fedora 10 Linux to make it dual-boot. (Doing this was surprisingly easy, as I could boot from a USB memory drive while trying it, then didn't need to erase anything to repartition the HDD and install Linux.)Little kids especially like the built-in camera.The Lenovo Ideapad S10 "large capacity" is the best computer deal I've found.

I know that I give this office 5 stars because I never used the older versions that the other reviewers did.  I did have to take the tutorials.I have really enjoyed the office and it has been a great learning experience. Other reviewers that gave the Office low scores were the ones that had the older version.  They had a lot of changes and a lot of new things to learn which they did not enjoy.I can say that if you never used any other version of office you will enjoy the 2007 full version.You do have to take the tutorials to get the full benefits of the office.I have been using the office for all most 2 months at the end of August.I would recommend this to my friends if they are interested in putting in the time to learn the software.

Anyone who enjoyed the first book but found the phrasing repetitive and the character of Bella to be mildly annoying, be warned.  Pgs 1-70 are actually interesting, aside from Bella being a brat about turning 18Pgs 70-400 are basically the plot of the first book, recycled, with Jacob as the new love interest.  As with Edward, she shuns the other kids at school, wants to spend all her time with him, and, when she finds out what he really is, she embraces it, meets the family...etc etc.pgs 400-the end are essentially the only novelty to the book.  Even so, it's ruined by the fact that Bella is so helpless and insecure.  I don't understand why Edward loves you either, Bella, but he does.  And I don't want to have to read 500 pages of him convincing you of that.This book is basically ACT II of the first book, but with a few less obnoxious descriptions of Edward's bronze hair/marble body/topaz eyes, and a few more obnoxious descriptions of the aching hole/depression in Bella's soul when Edward leaves her.Bella morphs from being slightly annoying and whiny, to being completely pathetic.  Her world revolves around Edward, so when he leaves, she is left in a catatonic state...until eventually she decides to rebel and do crazy things, in the hopes that she might hear his voice (oh yes, that velvet voice of his is in this book too, and velvet must be on Meyer's 'favorite adjectives list").  But then Bella finds reason for living again, in the arms of another man, Jacob.  Her basic attraction to him is based on...wait for it..."she's less miserable with him".  Hmmm....the co-dependent latches on again.  She completely leads him on, because the whole time she is with him, she is still thinking about Edward and how she can reunite her crazy messed up head with a precious delusion of him.  In the end, Edward and Jacob are mortal enemies (oh no!) and Bella is left choosing between the man who is the world to her, and the man who is the world to her when the man who really is the world to her is unavailable.  Gee, I wonder who she'll choose in the end.  Apparently Meyer wants us to think it's a toss up and plans to make another book of it.  Yeah right.I can only hope that the third book doesn't contain the following phrases and/or words, because I HATE THEM BY NOW:grimacedsmirkedtopazvelvet voicetouseled bronze hairmarble slabperfect facesinging laughteraching holerussett skinangelic anythingit felt like I was dreamingI wasn't sure if it was a dreamit had to be a dream

Eclipse is another great addition to the Twilight series. I could feel Jacob's pain in what he felt for Bella, I could feel Edward's pain in that he could see Bella loved someone else and he wasnt sure at one stage who she was going to choose. I felt Bella's pain in how she finally realised that she loved Jacob too and that she had to tell him that her choice is Edward as she cant live without him. I didnt like the love triangle at first as I knew that Bella and Edward were meant to be together however i can see how Bella needed to know exactly what she was giving up to be with Edward. The book was filled with a few funny moments especially when bella,jacob and Edward are in a tent together and its freezing and Bella's reaction to Jacob kissing her. A great book!!!! I recommend it.

I bought this item expecting to be blown away.  I wasn't. I needed to update the OS to 2.2 and was actually charged $10 by Apple.  I called Apple tech support to confirm and the tech first said "no way we would do that" then confirmed that in fact Apple had gone done that path.  Then their servers are so busy that after paying the $10 I couldn't update the OS..still can't.  The only saving grace I had is that I was considering the iPhone.  I decided against it since I didn't want to live with the smalled 3G network in the US in AT&T.  Thank goodness I didn't make that mistake.

I bought the Petmat Fresh Flow on sale at my local pet store for only $19.99. At such a low price, I thought it was a good deal, and both of my cats love to drink from the faucet. They'll meow for hours on end for us to turn on the water. The first six months we had this fountain, it worked wonderfully. The cats loved it, it filtered well, and it ran quietly. The water did need to be refilled frequently, as I don't think 50 oz is sufficient, but overall, it worked well.Then, after six months or so, it started to become very loud. The sound could only be ameliorated by filling the fountain REALLY full - within millimeters of the brim, and even then, it would take 30 minutes to fully quiet/settle down. It also started to collect a lot of dust and general dirt. I would attempt to wash it, but it never seemed to get clean. Eventually, we just got rid of it - the noise was getting too troublesome.Recently, I've purchased a Drinkwell Platinum Fountain (with 168 oz capacity), and I hope that it will be more durable than the Petmate was.

My daughter was the most happy when she was in her Halo.  I love these sleep blankets, the cotton ones for use in Florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece.  I wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits.  I recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep, your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Two-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

I thoroughly enjoyed Gone with the Wind as entertainment and spectacle.  The epic romance, even if it is about two rather shallow people (but what hilariously shallow people!).  The lavish sets and sweep of the story are both to be commended.  I can see why this movie is so remembered.However, I am not African American, and I try to imagine what it would be like to see it through their eyes.  The movie glorifies the slave-holding South ("the land of plenty and grace"!), and every black person--except the uppity black carpetbagger--is docile, happy-go-lucky, and stupid.  Yes, stupid.  The movie shares its era's perception that blacks aren't genetically up there with the white folks and runs with this idea for all it's worth.  Crissy, especially, is the personification of every racist stereotype imaginable:  brain-dead, cowardly, hysterical, likes to sing, etc.  Incredibly, the movie even thinks giving black Americans the right to vote is a mistake since they are easily misled by Yankees--as shown in that "You'll vote for your friends" scene.  And, of course, the Klan is glorified as a means of taking back Southern pride from uppity blacks and Yankees as shown by Ashley and Scarlett's second husband going after the people in the "shanty town."  And truly, do we really need to worry about the spoiled desires of two white people when millions of blacks were suffering through the worst humiliation and pain in the history of this country?  Excusing the blatant racism in this movie as "it's a product of its time" will only get you so far.So, yes, this is a good movie--but you might as well make an epic romance about the marital problems of two spoiled German Protestants during, say, the Holocaust.  And only because the people suffering here are black and not white can this movie get away with it.

My husband and I have really enjoyed this toaster.  The hard cooked eggs are the best I've ever eaten; they come out much better than hard boiled eggs.  The toaster is easy to use and looks nice.  Just put in a split English muffin, water in the well, break the egg into the little pan, put a pre-cooked sausage on top, add the lid, and turn it on.  Go make the bed, and come back to the kitchen, and breakfast is ready!  Easy clean-up too.

This book and its ethos are ridiculous.  "At Krispy Kreme, all you need to do is order the Very Berry Chiller instead of the Mocha Dream Chiller, and you'll save 500 calories! (Do that once a week and you'll drop more than 7 pounds this year-without trying!)"  The only time you should really be consuming either one of them is if someone put a gun to your head and forced you to choose one or the other.  Am I really reading that you should substitute a Big Mac for a Whopper to "drop pounds?"  This book should be insulting to you. If you're looking for something to make you feel better about unhealthy eating this is probably your best bet, but if you're really serious about making healthy changes to your diet you should probably pick up the ABS Diet or something similar.

I really should have paid closer attention to the negative feedback that this product was given.  I purchased these sheets for $60 because they were featured on Amazon's "Today's Deals" and I thought I was getting a steal of a deal.  What I actually got was basically a one-use disposable sheet set.  They fit loose on the bed before washing them, they shrink in the wash, but do so to the point that they rip when you put them back on the bed.  This I attribute to weak stitching at the seams.  The smooth finish that they initally have coming out of the package is lost on the first wash also, and a woman's mascara is all that it takes to permanently stain them.  I don't really care if my sheets wrinkle coming out of the dryer, which they did, but I do expect them to hold up to normal use.  I am very surprised that a product of such poor quality is listed on such a good online shopping site.

The installation of Adobe Acrobot Pro 9 Trial Version took so long that I sadly decided to cancel the installation half way through. It was almost like installing a new Windows!

So I've had my HF10 for about a month now. I'm extremely impressed with video and audio quality. Provided you are shooting with enough light, playback in full 1080P is amazing. Low light performance leaves a little to be desired. Autofocus hunts a little too much, again mostly in low light. The onboard light casts a strange blue glow that my wife calls "The Alien Abduction Cam". The camera is extremely light (other reviews have said the HF10 is about the size of a beer can - true that). Both my wife and I have no issues with the size. She has small hands, mine are a little ogrish. The fact that the PS3 directly supports playback from the SDHC cards is a major bonus (I'm assuming other Blu-Ray players with SDHC slots will do the same). No need to burn off to a DVD just to check out something you've just shot. As for the AVCHD codec. Argh, what a pain it is to try and edit this stuff. The codec requires lots of horsepower to edit natively and converting to HDV or WMV/AVI either takes too much time or lots of HD space. There are plenty of solutions out there that will edit AVCHD natively, but most of them are just plain garbage. I've tried several suites - Vegas, ULead, Studio Plus - but have found them to be unstable or user-unfriendly. I typically use Premiere Elements 4 on my PC for this stuff, but Adobe doesn't yet support AVCHD. For now, I've been backing up the raw M2TS files to a couple of mirrored external back-up drives on my PC, then using iMovie 2008 on a MacBookPro to convert to Apple's Intermediate Code (dropping from 1920x1080 to 960x540 in the process - yes, you WILL notice). From there, its all easy editing but its still a painful workaround. Hopefully, Apple and Adobe will add direct support for AVCHD in the future, but then...I was thinking the same thing last year. If you can overlook those issues (I almost couldn't, which is why I didn't get an AVCHD 'corder last year), you'll be rewarded with some spectacular video.

I grew out of space to store my videos and captured footage. I bought this large capacity drive to solve that problem, and it has worked.It was very easy to install on my desktop Mac. It has worked flawlessly out of the box, and the price was very competitive. I have used it for about one month so far.I read reviews which told me that it was a little noisy and I thought that this would not bother me. I agree that the noise is not loud. It is a mild continuous background hum. But I was wrong.... It does get to me. The noise never goes away, and is the only drawback to this neat, small footprint, shiny black repository of huge amounts of data.

This works well.  I used Doxycycline for awhile, but it stopped working. I now use this for my fluffer (little white maltipoo-rescue).  Used daily until his face cleared, I only use it a few times a week, now. Also, I don't use nearly as much as it calls for. No need. I just put a few sprinkles on his wet food. EASY!!! AND, it doesn't taste gross. Never had a problem with him not eating his food.  I still have over 1/2 a bottle and it has been MONTHS.

I put off getting one of these for myself for several years....... what a lose on my part. I bought this for Christmas for myself and let me tell you, I use if for EVERYTHING! I use it to mix meatloaf, banana bread and other things you normally would just to by hand. I now make homemade bread for my kids lunches and they love it. This mixer looks great, has plenty of power and is easy to clean and use. I plan on buying some attachments here real soon to make it even more useful. Do yourself a favor, if you have every wanted one of these.. BUY IT!

Just like another reviewer, I had a difficult time removing the sticker on the front door of the microwave.  By the time I had very carefully rubbed off the adhesive, there were 4 prominent scratch/scuff marks on my new microwave.  Sharp customer service was very uncooperative and unresponsive in helping me resolve the issue of a new microwave with blemishes because of the adhesive they used on a sticker which didn't need to be there in the first place.  They directed me to the nearest authorized service center where they said I would have to pick up the tab if I wanted a new door.  I chose this microwave for 2 reasons, it's small size fit in my cabinet space and it looked clean and modern.  Well now it looks cheap and ugly.  Let's face it, a microwave is a microwave, it heats up your leftovers, boils water, and pops your popcorn.  What you're left with is an appliance that fits your style or decor and a company that will back up their product should problems arise.  In my opinion, Sharp is not a company that backs up their products or cares about its customers--I will NEVER buy another Sharp product again!

I am very impressed with the new microsoft office. Office Home and Strudent Edition is very cheap, but it comes with full versions of the most essential office programs, namely Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. It also comes with OneNote, but I have not used that program. One of the greatest features in Microsoft WOrd is the ability to create citations for papers on the fly, alnog with bibliographies or works cited pages.  Word allows you to chose the citation style, i.e. MLA, chicago, etc... And then provides a form based on what kind of thing you are citing, i.e. book, web site, journal, periodical, etc... You just fill in the blanks and bam! Word inserts citiations for you and creates your works cited page. Very easy and very convienient. Just make sure you save all of your  work in windows 97 to 2003 mode, otherwise older versions of office won't be able to open them.

I earlier warned buyers about Intuit's new, hidden $10-per-printed-return fee, and asked Amazon.com to correct the listing so it was not hidden. Since then, Intuit has dropped this outrageous additional fee, but in the meantime I bought the cheaper rival Taxcut instead. Although it's not quite as easy to use as TurboTax (for example, you can't have it total multiple items in an entry to get a total, such as for expenses in Schedule C), it's easy enough to use. It won't take TurboTax users long to get into the Taxcut swing of things.I used to willingly pay extra for TurboTax's slighty better user interface, but Intuit's greedy play to essentially double its software's cost -- just four years after it tried something similar with its poor "antipiracy" limited-number-of-returns technology -- offends me deeply. It's clear the company will try yet again in a future version, regardless of customer feedback. So, I'm no longer a customer. Fool me once, ...

The Flip Mino is small--very small and very light weight. It fits comfortably in my pocket and isn't a bother to tote around for hours at a time. The soft pouch that comes with it is very handy and can double as a cloth for wiping fingerprints and smudges off of the unit and screen.The video quality is good--like a VHS tape that's been used over-and-over again, but with pixely artifacts, rather than a drifting image and fuzz. If you keep the camera still and if the subject of the shot isn't moving too much and if the lighting is decent, the image quality is really quite good--I would compare it to standard definition television. Overall, it's better than your average YouTube video. And though the image does become grainy in low light, it's still suitable for capturing candid moments. The sound quality is also good and the microphone is suitably sensitive. It picks up quiet speech without too much background noise and there is never a hiss or buzz.I put together a 30 minute video for SLG Publishing that was shot entirely with the Flip Mino at Comic-con International 2008. I used my MacBook Pro (the newest 15 inch version--purchased in May of 2008) and I edited the video with iMovie. I had to install the Flip video codec that came on the camera's flash drive and I updated iMovie to the latest version of the software, 7.1.4. After taking these steps, everything worked great. I found that the best way to manage the video was to import it using iPhoto (my MacBook Pro recognized the Flip as a camera and automatically opened iPhoto to import the video). iMovie will then add the video to its library for editing.Overall, my experience with the Flip Mino has been very possitive. It works as it is supposed to and that's really what I want when I buy electronics.Here's a link to the first part of the video that I made. It might help you to see what the video quality looks like. However, the video has been compressed a second time and is not indicative of the native video quality of the flip.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTnhGmzr8V4 (If you click the link to watch the video in high quality, that pretty much looks like the original video).

I have this router in my basement and can access the network from anywhere in my 2 story house.  Occasionally the router will hang, although that may be because of our Cable modem issues - however it is simple to unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging back in.  Web interface is not as user friendly as I have seen, but is powerful enough for any home users to set up their own wireless networks.  I wish they had a built in print server but that is minor considering it would have added at least $20 to the price, and can be purchased seperately. Probably still the best home 802.11g router available for performance, reliability and price.

This brush was used on our new malamute-mix dog, who has the heavy double-coat of the northern working breeds. Before it was used on him, every stroke of the hand over his coat let little puffs of soft white undercoat go flying into the air and onto our clothes. After a good brushing with the Furminator, in which two packed shopping bags of fur were removed, the shedding is VASTLY reduced, to a much more livable level.  I've had other double-coated dogs and used a variety of brushes and combs, grooming for an hour or so every few days in shedding season, taken bags of fur off the dogs, but still had fur come off while stroking the dog afterward. The Furminator seems different in that the fur quit shedding after the same amount of fur was removed, which is the partly the point of the grooming in the first place. I don't own one of these yet but since dog hair blowing around the house in puffy scads is irritating, I plan to get one after a little price-shopping. It is impressive what a difference the Furminator made this malamute's coat. It's softer and smoother and he looks so beautiful now.

I just bought this USB PNY to backup my important documents, photos and files and put the USB thumb drive in my bank's safe deposit box.  The 4GB was just enough room to get everything on it.  I was surprised on how slow the transfer rate was ... I mean slow!  When I moved 3GB of photos to the PNY it took over 22 minutes.  Also on the downside is that you don't get 4GB ... you lose 250MB - I know that memory is cheap now, but hey, some of you remember when 250MB was a huge hard drive!   Overall, super price and OK if for limited use, but not a memory USB I would tell others about - Conditionally recommended.

I heard a commercial for this about 3 or 4 times one evening, and I finally paid attention after barely listening to it the first few times.  Once I saw that it had interchangeable, *dishwasher-safe* plates, I told my husband that I wanted it for Christmas.  I popped over here to amazon and ordered it right away.  It got here before Christmas, but since it was my gift, I had to leave it alone until afterwards ;-)A few things attracted me to the grill.  Interchangeable plates, dishwasher safe, and the waffle plates.  I had been looking for a new wafflemaker, and in fact had looked at the store the night I saw the ad for the G5.  The one we've had for 11+ years is too small for our family now, and I wanted something bigger.  However, it seemed silly to spend a lot of money on one since I don't make them that often.  Imagine how happy I was to see the size of the plates on the commercial!  Let me tell you, I was not disappointed with my first waffle go-round a couple of days ago.  It makes 2 waffles that are each just about the size of 2 typical square freezer waffles.  That's what I'm talking about!  I made up a batch of Bisquick waffle batter, and set to cooking.  It was trial and error as far as learning cooking times.  I like my waffles softer, my husband likes them crispier.  I would say on average they needed to cook 5-7 minutes.  I pre-heated the grill as directed, and poured about 1.5 ladles of batter on each side.  I didn't get them perfectly full each time, but close enough, you know?  We ate them, we liked them!  I didn't have any issues with them cooking unevenly; each batch turned out just fine.Yesterday my husband made grilled cheese using the steak plate and the baking tray (upper & lower).  He tells me that he flipped it over so he'd have the same design on each side *insert rolly eyes here*, but otherwise it cooked just fine.Last night I made chocolate chip cookies using the recipe from the cookbook that came with the grill.  So cool!  They were virtually impossible to screw up!  I did cook them longer than the recipe called for after the first batch; cooking times I think are are things that will have to be judged individually for each recipe.  There are guidelines in the cookbook and the instruction manual, but I don't think they're hard and fast.  Experiment and see what works best for you :-)This morning my husband was at it again, this time making scrambled eggs.  I didn't get any (he ate them all while I was asleep!) but he says that they cooked the eggs in about 1/3 of the time as our gas stove.  He was pretty happy with that.I was pleased with the 2 drip trays and the better spatulas (also 2) that came with the grill, in addition to the cleaning sponge.  I don't know how often I'll use the sponge, since the plates clean so easily by hand (and once again, they are dishwasher-safe!), but it's nice to have.  I liked the other Foreman grills, but cleaning them stopped me from using them as often as I might have otherwise.  They were just kind of a pain; if you've used them you know what I mean.Get this grill :-)  If you have realistic expectations and are willing to experiment to get just the right cooking times, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'm not!

My mother in law has a CHI Iron, and she paid almost $200 dollars. Sometimes I borrowed it, and it was exactly like the one used in the hair salon, I wanted to buy it, but it simply looked too expensive, so when I saw it in Amazon at $70 dlls I just bought it, I received it very fast, and I noticed that although the box and the iron look the same, the material that is made is different (not the ceramic plates, but the black material), is ligther than the one of my mother in law, but still works great, my hair becomes smooth and silky. To me, it makes sense the difference in the material, cause is cheaper, but the main function does not have a problem, I recomend it.

Now in re-writes, I am a true believer in screenwriting software. Why didn't I get this years ago? Wow.

While the ribbon feature is excellent, this version of office is buggy.  It takes many more mouse clicks than necessary to get the job you are doing, done.  Especially right mouse clicks.  You have to click and click, and then graphics come up and get in the way, so you have to click again to get the graphics away so you can begin the clicking process again.  I am in the middle of a college paper, and it is a frustrating experience!  Stick with office 2003 until the next version comes out, which I hear is soon, and as the prices have dropped fifty dollars - might be the proof.

I've been a fan of Norelco razors and used them for about 15 years.  I've never had problems with them and frankly the main reason for not using the same razor for the whole time is that I have wanted the "upgrades" available in newer razors after a few years either more battery life or newer shaving head, such as the Spectra which is superior to the older styles.  Their replacement heads are very easy to change and the new heads make a significant difference in closeness.  I highly recommend that you replace the heads on an annual basis for best shaving quality/closeness and don't take a chance with replacement heads that are not Norelco OEM products.

I think worryingly my comments have been expressed repeatedly and the problems I have experienced seem to be shared by others.I have thick dark stubble and the following is what I found.The problems so far are that I just don't get a clean shave. There is no way I can arrive at work with patchy stubble like this. I know many say 3 weeks but what should I do in those 3 weeks? I don't have time to practice which is the reason I got this but I guess I'll keep trying. I just had to resort to a wet shave this morning though.The shaver gets hot, doesn't clean shave, despite going over the same area several times (very difficult on chin and neck) and stretching the skin in all directions, and actually starts to irritate by the end of the shave. Very worryingly, its been catching on slightly more prominent stubble! Ouch....On the plus side, the parts that do shave well are very clean (just below the sideburns), the unit looks great, it has excellent grip, and the cleaning feature is wonderful.At this early stage, I'm very worried and would give it an early 1 star if it wasn't for its looks. I didn't buy it for that though so a return may be in order.It appears to me from roughly combining the reviews so far, if you're used to electric shavers, this is a good product but if you're used to wet shaves, this might never match expectations, such is the quality of a decent wet shave.I will update my review in due course.

I have two cats. One has very thick, long hair that mats very easily and he was leaving hair all over the house from his shedding.  The other one has somewhat long hair that is silky and doesn't mat at all and doesn't shed too much. The furminator works great on the thick-haired cat. It gets out the dead hair that is trapped.  The first time I used it I had a pile of hair as big as the cat. I can use it once a week and not have hair everywhere from his shedding.  On the other cat it just kind of skims over the top and doesn't seem to get much hair out.  So it really depends on the kind of hair that your cat has.  I have tried lots of grooming tools and this is the best one I have ever used.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      

Heath Ledger is dead, and this is the role that, more or less, lead to his death. He showed promise with Brokeback Mountain and in The Dark Knight he cements the fact that he was more than just that guy from that teen movie that was based on a work by Shakespeare, but it won't happen.Oddly enough, this isn't the only saddening part about the film; pretty much every aspect is, other than Ledger's pitch perfect performance. It needs to be said: Christian Bale cannot act; ok he did a marvelous job in The Prestige, but that's a one time deal apparently. He's a horrid batman, not as bad as Clooney, but he's still unwatchable. Batman's supposed to have a gruff voice, I know this, but it's not supposed to sound like he's belching his lines, it's that simple.For a film that's over 2 hours long it sure promised a lot, built up a great deal of expectations and then just completely fizzled by the end of it.I'm sick of Morgan Freeman always, ALWAYS, playing the same role; the old wise man with an insightful perspective and reserved manner; does the man have no range? Please, someone give me a pointer to a film where he doesn't do the same old. Maggie Gyllenhall was absolutely awful as well, my lord, the bad performances are everywhere, so much so that they basically could have just edited it to the point where it's all Ledger's show and nothing else.The directing was nothing special, the story wasn't anything they couldn't have fit into a 23 minute episode of the cartoon, and the attempt to resonate a deep philosophical perspective is marred by the fact that it's just not well written or acted or directed. For an action film it certainly was incredibly tedious and unbearably slow.Nobody better try to feed me anything about this being a character study, or a comic book movie for adults; because it's not, you're fooling yourself if this is your frame of mind. It's a popcorn movie, a summer cash in, and nothing more; well, there's the cornerstone of nihilism that is The Joker, but other than that you're better off watching Killer Klowns from Outer Space.

Even after several adjustments and trimming the collar down significantly, this anti-bark dog collar was also an "anti-working" dog collar for our small shi-tzu/poodle mix.  After finally getting the fit we wanted, we (owners, not the dog) needed to blow directly into the mechanism to release the bark repellent.  I would not recommend this product, especially for small dogs (&lt;20lbs).

I was very excited about the possibilities of this little camera. It's small enough to carry anywhere and with the ability to download video to my computer and upload it to the world, it opened up a whole new channel of communication.Sadly, the results were far short of my expectations. On two different media-friendly Macs, the software simply wouldn't download video and make them available for edit. The process aborted at different stages at each attempt, sometimes in the download, sometimes when the videos were on the screen and I attempted to edit  them.   I guess you won't be seeing my video snippets on You Tube any time soon. I'm also sorry to see that this report of my experience has proved 'unhelpful' to some shoppers. I wonder what it is about my saying that I couldn't make it work that distresses them.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The  andbang BANG: A Novel ISBN 9781601640005

I have a 70-lb German Shepherd who, like all dogs in her breed, sheds so much that within a month there would be so much fur you could use it to stuff a pillow. We vacuum once or twice every day but there are still tufts of fur rolling around the house like tumbleweeds.I bought the medium-sized brush. It is a good size for her. Within five strokes through her coat, I had gotten enough fur to completely fill a normal slicker brush. Try to use this outside (and don't wear anything nice) because the fur will stick to everything. I imagine it feels good for the dog, because mine stood there the entire time- even though she has the attention span of a four-year old human. This tool is amazing!

Granted, high hopes from the Robert Downey Jr hype, but pure gold ended up being (unintentional) camp & cheese.Kudos to RDJ for taking a gamble (could've easily gone sour & branded him a racist, sending him to rehab for racism).  Innovative start w/ satirical fake previews (albeit, I'd seen that in the Family Guy 'movie').  Good surprise casting with the studio exec (but the makeup job was the only really funny part).In all, mildly entertaining.  I just bottomed the rating because it fell way short of the hype machine.

I cannot explain enough how horrible my experiences were with Seagate.  I originally bought this product to back up all of my memories- photographs, music, and documents- since my ancient computer was pitter pattering on it's way out and has a very small hard-drive. I had a 320 GB FreeAgent hard-drive and after about 8 months, one day it just stopped working.  I googled the issue to find out it is really common for Seagate products.  After calling Seagate technical support I found out that a company of theirs was my only option at getting my memories back (for a minimum of $1,000 and up to $3,000 in data recovery).  Seagate declares the warranty invalid if you get data recovery through any other company or service (which would be cheaper, but still extremely expensive).  What I decided to do in an act of desperation was physically take apart the casing and remove the hard-drive since I'm computer savvy and try to power it with a Caddy-drive.  Upon disassembling the Seagate product I saw that the power converter was singed and had fried my hard-drive, making it impossible to get any files back without going through an expensive service.  This could have been prevented had Seagate designed better ventilation/fan system for the amount of heat this drive produces.  Today, I got a quote from Best Buy- it would cost $1599 for data recovery through them.Best Buy told me flat out that this problem was 100% due to a poorly produced product and Seagate refuses to be helpful in the least.  Point being, Seagate hard-drives are poorly designed and they try to trap you into giving them money for data recovery once your drive fails.  All of their drives have the same problem, where they overheat and destroy the hard-drive.  The only reason most reviews have been good is because, like I did in the past, most reviewees have rated the hardware before it overheats.

i have to say that this bad boy does the job.  i've had it for months mow and still no pulling of the hairs.  the only drawback is the light.  its useless.  its a simple device for a good price.  i did a good amount of research for nose trimmers and found this one.  its great.

I have had a pair of jersey t-shirt sheets for well over 10 years.  They have held up well, but have a few stains and a couple little holes.  They are a little bit thin on the part where I lay, but I consider them thick in comparison to these Pike Street ones.  I was hoping to replace my sheets, but instead, I am keeping them as they are far superior to the Pike Street sheets.These Pike street sheets are atrocious to try to fit on the bed.  Yes, they fit, but are not all that deep.  But, the biggest problem is getting them on.  They grip, they are not soft smooth and glidey (if you will) like my other t-shirt sheets.  You cannot manuever them easily.  It took me at least 15 minutes or more to get them on right.  They have no give.  My other ones just go right on and are smooth enough to maneuver around, and the Pike Street, their surface is too rough and it is a huge struggle.The quality of these Pike Street sheets are awful!  After one wash, they have all kinds of pilling.  I thought only polyester pilled.  They are very thin.  I have the natural color and you can see your hand very well through them!  I can't imagine these sheets lasting even half as long as my others.  I would love to get another set of the others, but they are Charter Club and I cannot find them any longer, don't think they make jersey sheets anymore.  What a shame.  They do still make sheets, though, and I may buy the flannel ones later: CHARTER CLUB King Flannel Sheet Set with Penguins & Snowflakes, PG15SS787. I chose to buy these Pike Street sheets because it was a good price and all the other reviews I read for other brands said theirs were too small.  Big Mistake.  I don't know if all jersey sheets are made horribly like this, but I don't think I will order anymore jersey sheets by mail again.  I need to be able to look at them and touch them before buying.  These sheets are not soft and smooth and after one use, they look like I have had them 20 years.  Buy them only if you do not mind poor quality and don't mind fighting to get them on your bed correctly.

I have bought TurboTax for about 6 years and have been pretty happy with it. However, last year they started to charge for almost everything including clicking on the next button and the done button. I added this item into my wish list because it said "+ efile" and I thought okay for the price and I can efile for free I will buy. But with all your reviews I WILL NOT buy this time. I will try what another reviewer said and go onto IRS website and look @ what they offer. It will be hard at first to re-enter all the information, but it will be worth it! To print my doc it costs me money! Are your serious!!!Again Thankx for all the reviews :) I check them before I buy a product.

OK, I admit it, I bought this machine because I thought it looked terrific, cool design, heavy duty manufacture, and I was fond of the retro-chic of the dials and switches, like an airplane dashboard from thirty years ago.  The machine, however, has several design flaws that have greatly mitigated my warm feelings.  For one thing, the water reservoir into which you pour the water is located in the very back of the machine, next to the hinge for the lid.  It is awkward to use, the opening is too small, and your water often either splashes out of the back or into the coffee grounds.  Second, the hot water comes out of the lid and onto the grounds, but when closed, the lid is too close to the grounds and gets a lot of backsplash.  The grounds end up adhered to the lid which must be wiped off every time you use it or it will clog.  But when you wipe it actually pushes the grounds into the spray head.  Also, if you fill the (too small) gold filter while it is seated in the machine you are very likely to get grounds into the water reservoir which then necessitates a difficult cleaning of the entire works.  And I suspect that even if you fill it and then place it in the machine, the grounds sometimes get splashed into the reservoir during the brewing process.  The gold filter that fits this machine is too small.  We like our coffee strong and if you put in enough coffee for a whole 12 cup pot, it expands into the works and again clogs everything making you have to clean it.  Lastly, within about two weeks of our purchasing the machine, the little thingy at the bottom of the filter holder fell out (it is held in by a rubber band) and now we can no longer pull the pot out in the middle of the brew cycle (a convenient feature for those of us who are impatient and/or in a hurry) but must wait until the whole pot is made to get that first cup.  In sum, a beautiful and indeed heavy duty machine, but quite flawed.  I liked our old Braun maker much better.

I labored for many hours over my Turbo tax return and finally gave up.  My disc did not contain any of the basic tax forms.  The notice stated that the forms would be ready in November, 2007!  It said I could go to their website to get my forms but I couldn't find them there either.  One notice stated that I could "find One-click Updates from the Online menu to connect to our website."  I don't even know what that means.  I certainly could not find anything like those things.  Phooey! (That's a cleaned-up version of what I really feel!)

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      

We've all seen the movie (many of us multiple times) and the general consensus is that the film will be winning many awards. No need to keep repeating what everyone already knows. This is simply a review of the DVD, NOT THE MOVIE. Let's get right to the point..The Dark Knight Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy  has nothing special in it. This "Special Edition" DVD has NO directors and/or cast commentary, NO deleted or extended scenes, NO cast commentary, NO behind the scenes or the making of feature, and NO special effects behind the scenes feature. Basically everything you would expect to come in a DVD (especially a Two-Disc) is not in this one. If you only watched the 2nd disc of this Two-Disc edition you would never know that the late Heath Ledger was in it. There is no tribute or in memory of or any type of mention of Heath Ledger's death in this DVD. We all know we bought this DVD the day it came out assuming there would be more scenes of Ledger's "Joker" or some type of interview or extra footage of Ledger on set. Instead all we get with this DVD is basically the movie we saw in the summer transferred to a disc for us to take home. I could have just brought a camera to the theaters and taped it myself if I would have known that's all I would be getting by paying another $20 for this so called "Special Edition" DVD.It is quite clear that the powers that be at Warner Brothers looked to capitalize even further on the box office success of the "Dark Knight" by pumping out this lame excuse for a DVD just in time for the holiday season knowing that we would eat up the DVD just as fast as we did with the film in the theaters. What's even more disheartening is that in about 3 months times from now, when the "Dark Knight" buzz has died down after the holidays and after the awards season, Warner Brothers will release the "Ultimate Edition" or "Extended Edition" DVD, whatever they end up calling it, this will be the DVD we all thought we were buying the first time around. Knowing that the film very well could walk away with a couple Oscars, a rerelease immediately following is a definite. We all saw the film enough times in theaters that we deserve a worthy DVD with all the appropriate features that compliments the film. Screw You Warner Brothers, I want my money back.

OK.So I was initially looking at the Wireless-N version of this router, to potentially replace my old WRT54GS (Linksys Wireless G Router with SpeedBooster).  That router had problems, admittedly so.  It worked, but not as well as I'd liked given my setup.  Since all of my devices are either G or B wireless, I figured I would just settle for the G router and save money (this one is almost half the cost of the N router).For the record I've got a laptop (wireless), media server (wireless), PS3 (wireless), PSP (wireless), DS (wireless), EEE PC (wireless), PS2 (hardwire), 360 (hardwire), printer (hardwire), and DirecTV HR20 (hardwire).  Yeah, I know.  What's important: the media server is in the master bedroom's closet, far from the router, which is in the living room.  With my old router, signal strength got weak through walls, extremely weak.  Local network activity was painful, streaming movies from the media center was painful as it would frequently lock up and stutter; thumbnails would not load.Enter this router.  First thing to note: the CD is NOT required.  If you're new to wireless connections you may want to just follow the directions and CD, but if you're comfortable with navigating the router web interface, just bypass the CD and set it up like you normally would; it'll work.  Setup was quite painless and recognition was fast, I managed to replace my old wireless network in a matter of minutes.  There is also a feature that allows for a WiFi Protected Setup with a one-button press, but apparently the receivers require that feature to be built in as well - and none of mine did.  Therefore I just ignored it.  For those who are setting up for the first time and bought receivers with the feature included, they might find it useful when doing the setup.I immediately noticed an improvement in the local networking speed.  The aforementioned media server is now screaming fast over the network; thumbnails load just as fast as if I'm at the machine, file transfers are nowhere near as slow and streaming content plays with minimal lag.  Internet connectivity was also slightly improved on devices that were not close to the router.There are a couple of issues, not necessarily the router's fault, but more an issue with the way Linksys designs them.  First, getting internet connectivity took way too long and was not as easy as it should have been.  I had to powercycle my modem to get it to pull the IP information - even though the details should have easily been accessible from the previous router having gotten them.  This might be a Time Warner issue rather than a Linksys issue - maybe it sees a different MAC and freaks, but I doubt it.  Once I got the IP information, the router still would not give internet connectivity for a minute.  I'm using Vista Premium so I can tell when it's "Local", "Internet" or both and it struggled to get both up.Second, and a minor nitpick at best, the power cord is easily half the size of the WRT54GS.  For the life of me I can't understand this.  It makes it hard for me to locate the router in a good place, because I like to have the router on the UPS, and by shortening the cord I have to have the router in the middle of the floor.  Minor issue, but still a problem for me.Otherwise, I highly recommend this.  It seems they fixed the majority of the problems the previous devices had.  I noted that the negative reviews came from people who had support problems; I never call the Bombay support line, so I have nothing bad to say.

I saw this advertised on Amazon for a whopping ===$18.74=== and realized it'd be foolish not to try.  The product was shipped quickly and relatively easy to set up; it took about 10 minutes to read the manual, measure the average distance of my steps, and then program it all into the Omron.This pedometer is fairly accurate, lightweight, and easy to use.  I find that it helps me keep track of my daily exercise levels, and is a subtle reminder sometime when I need to step it up.  Haha, pun intended.  Anyway.  The only complaint I have is that there's no light or beeping timer feature on this device.  I do a lot of walking in the evening and I don't always have a light handy to read the pedometer.  Also, I like to run for set time periods and having to actually manually check the amount of time I've been at it can be a little frustrating.  It loses a star for those things, but otherwise I've found this to be both accurate and helpful as I track my fitness level.I recommend this to anyone who just wants to monitor their activity and maybe measure progress in terms of getting more active.  You can definitely keep track with all of the simple but effective features provided in this device.

I read other reviews before trying this product, people saying it really helped them lose weight and that it cleaned out their systems (e.i. they pooped a lot), and I figured $8 was worth the try. So, I've used it for the past month, and I have seen no changes whatsoever. Upon reading from the websites for these Acai products, they say you should take it twice a day, drink lots of water and not eat after 7 pm. There's the clincher. Probably a lot of people who started taking this were not in the habit of doing those things already. I, on the other hand, already drank lots of water, watched my diet, and pooped pretty regularly. I even increased my exercise while taking this stuff and I haven't lost a pound (let alone the 10 or so pounds people claim to have lost). So, perhaps those who have seen a difference just weren't eating enough fiber in the first place and so of course they saw a difference. I figure if this isn't going to do anything spectacular, I'll just stick with my regular fruits and vegetables as usual.

Installation is easy,I like the Network magic software but I think its claimed wireless speed is a lie.I tried with D-Link Rangebooster N 650 adapter(DWA645).After I reboot the router,speed stay high for while then slows down over the time.Even LAN speed is very slow, slower than my old router (Netgear Rangemax WPN824).Sometimes, signal just drops and get disconnected.Wireless speed G or N is horribly slow.I already tried in many ways and I am really dissapointed with its unstable performance.

I bought this to use with a hardwired home PC network and wireless connectivity.  The unit is fast and easy to set-up, but worthless with the current firmware.  One out of every ten attempts to connect to the internet fail intermittently.  A search for the problem found dozens of people having the same issue with the current firmware.  Linksys tech support has no current fix.  I am not running any special configuration or computers.  I was replacing an older netgear router and wireless router to consolidate to one device.  Everything worked perfect before the switch. DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE... WAIT UNTIL LINKSYS HAS A FIX!

As a musician, I expect digital files to play on speed and at proper pitch.I noticed on the Fuze that my mp3s sounded 'dull' or lazy at first.  When I compared them with my identical PC files (from a wide variety of ripping and purchasing sources)and found that the Fuze played off speed and off pitch.  This makes the Fuze unusable for any serious music practicing.  I can't be bothered to re-tune all of my instruments just to play against the tracks on the Fuze.  I wonder how digital reproduction could be butchered by Sansa's oversight.  This is not a phonograph or a tape player that is subject to speed variations.I love the player in all other respects.  It went back for a refund and I got a Sony NWZ-438F that plays and sounds perfectly.

Short story: Do not purchase this device.Long story: I purchased the Linksys WRT54G to upgrade from a B-only Netgear router. Out of the box, only wired connections worked. Not one of the 5 wireless devices that I have connected: 3 B-only devices, 2 B-G laptops. (Detail: I would get a wireless connection to the router but could not get DHCP addresses.)Went online and searched, recent WRT54G firmwares had a bug with DHCP. Details were sparse, but everyone thought it was only their kind of device (Apple, B-only, internal laptop, PSP, XBox, etc). Setting a static IP didn't work for me as it had in some of the posts I saw out there.My conclusion: Out of the box, you shouldn't expect non-Linksys wireless devices to work with the current incarnation of this router (purchased Dec 23, 2006).The sad but fated conclusion: A new firmware promised to fix the bug, so I thought I'd be a power user and download it. Note to Linksys: if your firmware download page has seven or more downloads specifically for the WRT54G, you should give the end-user an obvious link telling them how to determine which WRT54G to use.I submitted the firmware up to the router, and it went to a blank page that said, "Don't interrupt this." I understand you can't interrupt these things, so I went about other business.After 15 minutes, the page hadn't auto-refreshed, so I opened another tab and logged in, and the router was chugging along with the old firmware. What's a person to do? Wait? Retry? Power-cycle?Well, I won't invite armchairing by further details, except to state that the router briefly reported itself as running the new firmware, but still wouldn't DHCP my wireless devices, then wouldn't DHCP my wired device, and finally wouldn't respond at all (brick had been achieved).I've returned to the Netgear brand with one of their new routers, and gee, plug it in and it works. The quick install sheet even has a section: "What if I'm familiar with this stuff and don't want to use the wizard?"

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)
      

As a fan of the Transformers cartoons, I was worried when I heard Michael Bay was directing the film. I did have some hope though since Spielberg was somewhat involved though. Too bad the movie was molded more from the creative liberties of Michael Bay's ego than it's source material. Some things that made this movie suck: Bumblebee playing cupid despite having more pressing things to worry about like Decipticons, Starscream's lack of any personality especially since he was one of the most entertaining personalities on the show, Optimus Prime tip toe'ing around a garden like a worried soccer mom, Barricade just kinda dissapears, Sector 7 was stupid, the government drama was horrible, the transformers seemed like more of an afterthought since they only came out a few times. If you liked the movie, great. Enjoy it. But I found it butchered by Michael Bay.

I read a lot about this machine before I bought it so I was somewhat prepared for its shortcomings, but I have to say they didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected they would. The steam wand is a little close to the counter, but not to the point that I even notice it. It is a relatively small machine overall, but that is to be expected in this price range. I think for the price, it makes awesome coffee. I had a Starbucks machine that cost around $200 that never made coffee as well as this machine. The coffee itself has a great crema and the milk tastes like it has been frothed in a cafe. I am really happy with my purchase.

I have the v4 version and it worked great with my Macs running OSX when I first got it.  Easy, smooth set up and decent documentation, which is often rare for Mac users.  But just like so many of the previous reviewers, after several months my wireless connection would drop frequently everyday requiring constant power unplug/replugs.  I contacted customer support, tried everything including resets, and going through every Netgear router firmware available.  The router continued to work great with a wired connection, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a wifi router.  I just bought a Buffalo router to replace this one.

This will not be an actual review since the product never worked! After it arrived at the date specified, when I turned it on after 8-9 seconds and at the Acer logo, it shuts off no matter how many times I tried. Bad luck! The worst thing is the process you have to go through for a replacement: they (Amazon) do not believe you that the product is defective(!), they ask you to personally contact Acer, make a case number with them, provide the feedback to Amazon and then... after they receive the product, they will decide!  On top of that the technical support to Acer they provide, asks you first of all to provide credit card information and while saying that they do not promise your issue to be resolved they  ask for $85 to be available from your card just in case...! Why should I spend so much time, effort and more money for someone that does not believe what I am claiming? I know ( from I what I have read) the computer itself is a very good product but the resolution service, and troubleshooting of both Amazon and Acer is of the worst quality! After I spoke with an Amazon representative over the phone, they do not want to accept a replacement order without going through the above process so I am sending back the computer for a full refund!

I have had now this camera for several months, but only now I had the time to used a little more often, so I decided to leave my opinion for future buyers. If you are looking to this device as an hybrid, you will make the same mistake you made. Still picture are just simply bad, doesn't matter if you are in low light or in plain sunlight. Of course the ones taken in low light are much worse than the one in sunlight, making them worthless. Maybe my standards are higher the other reviewers but I think a picture taken at ISO 200 should not suffer from heavy noise artifacts!! If you are shooting in sunlight and look at you pics in the cam monitor, they will look fine, but as soon as you will look at them in your PC, you will discover that if you can save 1 out of 10 you are lucky.I guess video is fine for the type of sensors, and being a low resolution you can expect much. In video mode, the camera is really good to balance the white. If you need to shoot in low light, you better set the ISO manually to no more than 200, and activate the high sensitivity. This will allow for a minimum noise impact in your video. Another thing I like of the device is the responsiveness. It is really easy to start shooting videos, with almost no delay. So, if you care more about catching the moment but you are not very concern about the quality of the results, I guess this device will work for you. Another thing many people were excited about is the ability to take videos at 60fps. There is a major issue in this mode. Because the camera is operating at double the speed, the auto focus system produces a lot of click noise (hard to describe in other way) that is picked up by the mic. If you are shooting in a quite environment, you will be disappointed by the results.Overall I like the feeling of the camera, and I really wish it worked as described. I would NOT by it again. I will probably save some more money and get a high def camera. PS: other cons are the very short battery life, the almost useless image stabilization and the face detection features that almost never recognize a face, not even when you have it right on camera!!

What a mess!  I gave the ASUS away, thinking larger keys/screen would be worth the extra price. Here's what I got with the HP 2133:1.  Touch pad sends the cursor bouncing around, you'll spend a minimum couple seconds trying to find it every time you use it.2.  After two weeks of sitting on my credenza,  booting up produced ... nothing.  The unit wasn't dropped, abused,  the OS simply evaporated.3.  HP's website doesn't recognize HP 2133,  HP 2133 Mini-Note,  etc.  You get the idea HP is ashamed of it.  The only way to get email to a service tech without a product number is to email the President.4.  The first tech who called quickly realized the OS was ... whatever it was.  He shipped a dvd with SUSE on it.  I didn't ask the obvious,  why didn't HP ship it with the 2133 to begin with.  I tried to find tech info,  operating manuals on the website.  Good luck.5.  The dvd loaded from an stand-alone optical drive,  thankfully,  I have one.6.  The new OS is as screwed up as the first;  of course,  installing it wipes out everything on the computer previously.  The computer keeps asking for a hd password,  advising that the hd (actually the 4gig flash memory) is locked until the right password is entered.  Huh?  This wasn't on the OS previously.  7.  I use the same password for everything,  I assumed it was from something on the OS before it blew up.  That password doesn't work on the 2133.  After four wrong guesses the OS finally proceeds,  recognizes f9, f10, f11, etc.  However,  without the password,  it's a circular firing squad,  back and forth,  till I give up.  There's a list of possible generic passwords for SUSE on the Internet.  None of them work.8.  I wrote the President of HP again,  got an email from the head of the linux hp 2133 unit,  or something like that.  Who hasn't returned my calls or emails.  He did suggest via email that I should send the 2133 to him so he could straighten out the mess.  That's a first,  and confirmation for me that HP recognizes what a disaster it has brewing.9.  Maybe I didn't know where to find the program, before it blew up I tried to watch movies,  .avi and .mpg formats.  Neither of which worked.  I've finally found a linux movie player on the internet,  problem is,  I can't access the computer to add it or test it.10.  I've loaded the OS from the dvd three or four times,  after loading I get the 'enter password' screen.11.  I like to think I'm a somewhat sophisticated user,  I go back to TRS-DOS.  Open Office, Firefox, work OK.  I've found linux requires far more effort to use than XP.  That was before it blew up.12.  The cat loves flopping down anywhere the computer has been resting.  It's not quite hot enough to fix flapjacks,  but it's close.13.  I stopped by Office Depot today to buy an XP for $99.  At checkout I saw the small print,  'this is only an upgrade of a prior Windows OS.' Of course,  there is no Windows OS.  I saved $100,  but don't have a notebook computer to take on a trip Monday.14.  Complete XP is $200.  Spending $200 on XP to add to the 2133 is foolish,  I can buy the Acer Aspire One for not that much more.15.  I told the tech at HP ... I haven't been fishing in decades,  but I'll go just to use the HP as a sinker.16.  I've got an order in for Acer Aspire One,  $349 for the 1gig 120hd, XP at MicroCenter.  The keys are still kinda small and tight, I don't like Bill Gates, etc.,  but it can't be the disaster the HP has been.17.  Save your money.  You'll thank me.

Otherwise they can take thisthing and shove it!Edit:I feel completely stupid. You have to have the top on thecarafe in order for it to push up the button on the coffeedispenser. This is for the brew pause function. When pulledout the button release stopping the drip.I'm coffee maker stupid :-)Anyone having the same problem make sure your cover ison.I'll call Cuisinart and have them make note of it to save them some unneeded returns.Can I change my rating up from one star? I don't see anyway to do so.

I used K9 Advantix because I was bringing my dog with me on vacation into tick-infested woods.  I used three-quarters of the 20 lb. dose on my 13 lb. poodle.  Approx. 12 hours after application, she began to have terrible neurological symptoms, running in circles and crying, jerking and jumping.  Her nose became very hot and her breathing became rapid and shallow.  We were up all night.  By the time I got instructions over the telephone to wash it off with liquid dish detergent, it had been 24 hours.  She survived, but the cartilage in her throat has been damaged and her bark is permanently changed.  If you are using this product for the first time, PLEASE use only half the recommended dose and standby with the liquid dish detergent.  If your dog can stand it, you can apply the rest two days later.  The only antidote for permethrin poisoning is to wash it off with liquid dish detergent within the first 24 hours!  Many dogs have been injured, and deaths have been attributed to K9 Advantix.  If you feel you must use it, first read the horror stories on the internet.  Bayer Animal Health should have included on the box instructions on how to wash it off with detergent if there was an adverse reaction.

For examples:(1)Irrelevant GUIs take away too much usable space from the screen.(2) Apple seems to use it as an advertising tool, as often it would prompt me to purchase MobileMe and instructed me to sign up some tutorials at the Apple store etc. Compared to that, PCs are cleaner. (3) Stuff in trash can't be emptied, as they are locked by the computer.(4) When you open a file directory, a new window will pop up.(5) No Cut and move option for file managements.  You have to select one file at a time and copy and delete it if you want to move it to a different location.Thus, despite me having received this computer for just a few hours,  I already dislike it.

Ok i had the sandisk 512MB and it worked perfect for a long time and it didnt matter how many times i dropped it it still worked perfect. Now when i purchased the 2GB it worked for exactly one day.It froze on me and i turned it off and turned it back on and it stopped working completley. I had about 323 songs on there. It dont matter how many songs you put on there the product is gonna run very slow...it also takes a long time to load all of the songs. ANd i wrote amazon about it and about it and no response. The reason they didnt respond is because they sent me another one mp3 player which was a very good thing. But the same thing happened but faster...i was so disappointed. SO i told them what happened because it just happened last night. So hopefull i will get a refund or get somethin free.

I just wanted to make a quick note here.  I purchased a Brew'n'Go about a year ago now, and while mine works fine, my sister had purchased one and had to return it because the switch didn't work properly.  When she replaced it with a new one, it had the exact same problem and just recently broke down altogether.  One problem I've had with mine is the ever increasing amount of coffee grind residue passing through the filter.  I mainly use my Brew'n'Go now for hot water when making tea or hot chocolate.  If you just want good hot water that doesn't taste like the microwave, then this is a good purchase.  If you want fast and good coffee, search on.

This review is from: Religulous [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      

Every once in a while a truly bad movie comes along. This is one of them. Bill Maher interviews a couple dozen adherents of religion with the goal of making them look stupid. He employs tomahawk journalism and condescending sarcasm, edits the interviews to suit his purpose, and chooses easy targets, like an evangelist who claims to be Jesus, an actor who plays Jesus at a theme park, and a "Cannabis Ministry" in Amsterdam. Sure, there are a few funny moments, but Maher mainly succeeds in looking horribly smug. When he tries to be personal and explore his own religious views, as when he interviews his mother, we learn nothing interesting. When he tries to be serious, as when he interviews a Vatican astronomer or Francis Collins, head of the Genome Project and an outspoken Christian, Maher looks like a badly uninformed and unprepared eighth grader trying to impress his teacher. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, at the end of the film Maher intones with utmost seriousness, "for mankind to survive, religion must end." Okay, thanks for that amazing insight. This is a mockumentary mashup.

NO 3rd Party Firmware exists for this model. The problem is the amount of RAM (2/8Mb) and the OS is VxWorks and not Linux.The version Amazon shipping is v5. If you want to use 3rd Party Firmwares, DO NOT BUY A WRT54G v5.To find out which WRT54G you are buying look at the serial number on the box. If it starts with CDFB then it is a v5.For the others who don't use custom firmwares, be aware that v5 is running on a new platform with new firmware (rev 1.00.00 as of Oct 2005) so problems may arise.

Another good amazon buy. Price was good (&lt;50$). I was replacing my previous (Netgear) wireless router after 3+ years. Setting it up had some hickups. Called the 1-800# and they walked me through the set up process. Now my wireless home network is working fine. I have a network printer, a voip phone and a home computer hooked to this router. Also, my home laptop, my wife's laptop, and my work laptop, all stress it for bandwidth. We haven't had any problems yet.

TO MAKE A SAD STORY SHORT:This died on me in three days.TO MAKE THE STORY LONGER:Even the best electro/mechanical equipment does fail occasionally and early failures are usually some kind of manufacturing defect that may only affect a very small percentage of devices that come off the line. Once a device makes it past a week or so there is a good chance nothing is wrong with that particular sample. So, there is a really good chance that this failure is atypical.TAKE A CHANCE?If you want to take chance on this drive (and if you do, the odds are in your favor) consider the following:1. Almost any drive you look at on Amazon, if there are more than a few reviews, you will see reports of failure.2. This drive is reasonably priced so if you get a good one you are getting a good deal. Be sure to look over to the right hand side of the product page and pick the seller with the best deal. As of this writing it could be a difference of $20.3. The drive is easy to install and use. For USB it is as easy as plugging in any USB device (memory stick, SD card).4. The drive does support eSATA (first generation, 1.5 Gb/sec).BUT FOR ME PERSONALLY:Once bitten twice shy. So a two star review. Let those who have had better luck give it the five star reviews. Things will average out. This attitude did cost me as I replaced this unit with something more expensive in the hopes that it will be more reliable: LaCie 301442U d2 Quadra Hard Disk 1TB eSATA/FireWire800/FireWire400/USB 2.0 External Hard Drive (Aluminum).I now have a review posted for the LaCie drive.

Bought this and thought I got a great deal ($140). All three of my towers and one laptop have trouble detecting it. Also, it overheats in less than thirty minutes, even if it's just on. 500 gigs is nice, but not if you have to go through all this trouble. Lately it hasn't been detected at all by any of my computers. I'll probably remove the actual drive and see what I can do. This was totally not worth buying.

I bought this router months ago, and while it does send out a strong wireless signal, it frequently drops.  I don't have to restart the router, it restarts itself... but where it really bothers me is with online games... I get booted from the server in the middle of a game.. It's terribly annoying, and random.Also, I thought I was getting a good deal with the rebate and all, but they never sent me my rebate and act like I never sent them anything at all.  Big scam, inferior product.  If I could get my money back and do it again, I'd shell out a bit more for a linksys or something else.

Ref:  SimpleTech 500 GB external hard drive.I'm not a very happy camper.  I bought the hardware with the CD install disk.  Started to install using that disk and received a message that the disk had a Trojan Horse virus on it and my machine would not open it.Then I emailed Simpletech.  Got a link to install software from their internet site, which I did.  After installing, tried to hit the back up button and was informed that I had to create a backup folder first.  This I did and then did a file dump.  It took over 2 hours for the file backup and compare, for about a 1.1 Gig backup.  I don't know if that is long or short, but that is the time it took.Next, I tried to access my Palm Pilot calendar software, only to find out that all my calendar data had disappeared.  Emailed Simpletech again to find out why and they stated that their product did not back up or deal with any scheduling software, so their product had nothing to do with the mysterious disappearance.  (Note, in fairness, I had not been able to back up my PC scheduler to my handheld device since March of 2008 because of a software glitch with the palm software.)  So then, I called PalmPilot software support.  They corrected the glitch that would not allow hotsyncing of the handheld and the PC, but were unable to find the missing calendar files.  I was on the phone with them for 3 hours.  And they charged me a fee for the technical support.Bottom line, if you are going to back up your files on a Simpletech device, you should back them up somewhere else first, like a network backup source if you have access to one, so if the software messes with your other programs, you are protected.

I threw my George Foreman grill away.  My house would smell so gross I would get sick to my stomach not to mention the fact that whatever my husband and I grilled was tough as leather and dry not to mention the clean up was horrible.  We received this grill last week and used it.  Hubby and I love it!! It has a tempature control unit so things that need to cook slower will be cooked according to your taste.  The clean up is super easy and this will be used a lot! The instruction booklet comes with instructions and temperature settings for all kinds of meat.  This is a great size grill for larger families too!   Well done Sanyo...Well done!!! I highly recommend this for anyone especially those that haven't had good experiences with George Foreman grills.

I ordered this toaster from Amazon and it arrived full of scratches and one nasty dent. They exchanged it for me with no problem but the second one had more scratches than the first one did and had a horrid, can't miss it dent on the front with a matching one on the rear, directly behind the first one at the same height. Amazon informed me they couldn't exchange it for me again so I just returned it and ordered one from Macy's. The one I received from Macy's arrived in great shape. The only flaws were ones from the mold used in the casting process, to be expected, and not big deal. It looks very cool and makes excellent toast. It's nice not having to use my oven broiler with a need to flip the bread over after one side is down plus need to closely watch it so it doesn't burn. Having this making toast under a broiler made me realize what a genius the inventor of the toaster was. Forget Einstein. Praises to Charles Strite, inventor of the Pop Up toaster. Pop up toasters didn't really make it big until the introduction of Wonder Bread, the first sliced bread to hit the market. After the introduction of Wonder Bread, Strite's toasters just flew off the shelves. Hmmmm remember Window's Flying Toaster screen saver?

Originally, I was looking for a trimmer to keep my beard to managable lengths.  I was pretty sure that this thing wasn't designed to take care of that, but I figured I'd get it anyway, as there were other areas that needed a trim as well.First, as most reviews have said, this thing is worthless when wet.  It's not like it just doesn't cut close...it doesn't cut *at all.*Unfortunately, what most reviews don't tell you is that it's almost as worthless when dry.I tried in on the back of my neck/shoulders, and it failed miserably.  Even with the guards off, where it's supposed to "completely" remove the hair, it barely made a dent.  Ok...maybe that hair is too thin/wispy...so I tried something a bit thicker, and went for my beard.It shaved close there, but was very patchy.  Fine, so maybe it works better on thicker, coarse hair.  On to the armpits.  Yeah, useless there as well.  I pulled the skin there as tight as I could, stuck my arm in weird positions, did everything I could to make it easy to shave in that area.  Nothing.  Completely failed.Ok, fine.  There's one other area that this thing may be able to redeem itself in.  I mean, a standard straight-blade razor can take care of the rest, but unless I want to change my religion, a straight-blade isn't going anywhere south of the belt line.I will say this...on the groin, this thing works pretty well.  Cleans things up nicely using the biggest guard.  On the "boys," however, it's a no-go.  Just doesn't work for a damn.  When/where it *does* work, it's totally painless, so no problems there.  But for $40, this thing needs to work in more than just one area.

Before brewing my first cup of coffee, I washed all components, and ran hot water through a brew cycle. Before throwing out the water from the mug, I noticed an unpleasant hot plastic odor. Assuming it was from manufacturing, I repeated the hot water brewing cycle. The smell persisted. Another repeat. Then I ran the mug through the dishwasher. Finally, I made coffee. It brewed fast, the strength was good, but that plasticness overwhelmed the coffee.  It should be noted that while the included mug may have the look of aluminum, the interior is black plastic. I was happy with the speed and convenience of the brewing, so I tried a ceramic mug which fit in the space under the drip basket.  This gave me hot, decent tasting coffee,  but obviously not "to go". Luckily, I have an insulated all aluminum travel mug which just barely fits under the brewer, and by adjusting the amount of water and coffee I use, I'm now able to finally Brew and Go. This product is fine for quick single servings, as there is no hot plate to keep your beverage warm. There is simply no excuse for that mug.

This review is from: Darby O'Gill & The Little People (VHS Tape)
      

I've been a film fanatic all my life and to some degree I credit good ould Darby O'Gill for that. I was a guest at the world premiere on the 24th of June 1959 in the Theatre Royal Dublin. Walt Disney was there along with Albert Sharpe and Janet Munro and a whole string of cast members ( Sean Connery may have been but not sure ) I still have the souvenir programme, which by todays standards is a hoot to read. There was a huge guest list. The theatre was packed even though it held over 3500. Prior to Walt Disney making a short speech and the cast parading across the stage. The lights went down and the huge Compton organ rose hydraulically from the orchestra pit, with Tommy Dando the star organist playing some rousing tunes. Then the screen was lowered. I loved every minute of this film. Its on a par with The Quiet Man including the harsh fact that it doesn't reflect the Ireland of then or now - but frankly I don't give a damn. I've enjoyed a wide range of cinema all my life and yet every few years Darby O'Gill gets an airing and I feel better for it and considering I was only fifteen in 1959 that makes me feel even better!

I am an accomplished computer programmer (MFC/.NET/DirectX)2. I am very familiar with Windows platform & TCP/IP protocol3. Configuring this router was a nightmare.4.

This is the second Kitchenaid mixer that I have owned.  On the first mixer the handle that raises the bowl broke after a couple of years.  Kitchenaid did not stand behind the product.  On this one, the speed started to fluctuate after only being used three times.  I returned it and am planning to replace it with another brand.  DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE!

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) (DVD)
      

 ...for saying that disingenuous Machiavellians are easily housebroken. That clearly wins the prize for being the most juvenile and impulsive thing I've ever heard. Let's get down to business: He says that hanging out with patronizing Philistines is a wonderful, culturally enriching experience. This is at best wrong. At worst, it is a lie. In the past, I've said that his modus operandi is to give lunatics control of the asylum. Were I to make such a generalization today, it would contain a few "weasel words" -- an escape hatch or that indispensable cliche that he descends from a long line of mumpish punks who like to clear-cut ancient forest lands. But because even those few who benefit from his announcements fail to recognize their current manifestation as a poxy, combative form of Comstockism, I am not ready to retract my conviction or to recant error. More often than not, the best thing about him is the way that he encourages us to lay out some ideas and interpretations that hold the potential for insight. No, wait; Optimus doesn't encourage that. On the contrary, he discourages us from admitting that he likes to compare his mottos to those that shaped this nation. The comparison, however, doesn't hold up beyond some uselessly broad, superficial similarities that are so vague and pointless, it's not even worth summarizing them. Once we have absorbed and understood his tyrannical wheelings and dealings, it is our inescapable responsibility to do whatever is necessary to take personal action and improve the physical and spiritual quality of life for the population at present and for those yet to come.Yes, you heard me right; whenever Optimus announces that truth is whatever your grievance group says it is, his minions applaud on cue and the accolades are long and ostentatious. What's funny is that they don't provide similar feedback whenever I tell them that if Optimus were paying attention -- which it would seem he is not, as I've already gone over this -- he'd see that he is driving me nuts. I can't take it anymore! What's interesting is that we were put on this planet to be active, to struggle, and to illustrate the virtues that Optimus lacks -- courage, truthfulness, courtesy, honesty, diligence, chivalry, loyalty, and industry. We were not put here to scapegoat easy, unpopular targets, thereby diverting responsibility from more culpable parties, as Optimus might insist. I use such language purposefully -- and somewhat sardonically -- to illustrate how this cannot go on much longer. He may mean well but his equivocations are a cesspool of vigilantism. If you doubt this, just ask around. Optimus once used his notoriety, name recognition, and national fund-raising base to champion censorship in the name of free speech, intolerance in the name of tolerance, and oppression in the name of freedom. Now that that's cleared up, I'll continue with what I was saying before, that ageism is not merely an attack on our moral fiber. It is also a politically motivated attack on knowledge. The recent outrage at Optimus Prime's commentaries may point to a brighter future. For now, however, I must leave you knowing that he often uses the phrase, "Studies show that...", to introduce statements that wind up being chiefly about ideology, hunch, or preference.

I have been doing Tracy's Mat Workout for 6 weeks(5 times a week). This video works. I have seen definite results. My hips and thighs are much more balanced, my arms are more defined and my core feels much stronger. The most unexpected thing though is a definite decrease in the cellulite on my thighs and tush. Her manner might be strange, but I swear by her Method.

I purchased this drive just before Christmas and by the first week of January I started having problems.  Diagnostics provided a RMA number to return to Seagate.  The included software shows the drive is connected, but the drive appears empty.  I powered the drive off an on several times and finally got it to connect long enough to get all of my files back on my PC's hard drive. I would not rely on this drive for anything important that you can't live without!

My wife and I use this all the time, since we have different tastes in coffee. And for guests who drink decaf, it's perfect to brew them one cup, instead of brewing a whole pot just for them.The only drawback is that the coffee cups you have to use with this product are very expensive. If you're a heavy coffee drinker like me, plan on spending more then twice the amount you would brewing pots.

Kudos to who knows who said that. This is an excellent show and great entertainment, and I don't have an issue with the pricing. With values such as Amazon I can watch the show and still munch on popcorn at the same time. At some point you have to decide if the cost exceeds your desire to see the show. For me it hasn't. For those who complain, but still buy the DVD sets, it hasn't either. At some point, however, I'll stop putting gas in my car. That's another story and probably a truer example of one of the many ways we are truly being ripped off, but at least with BSG there is a great idea, with talented writers and Im getting great entertainment and I'm happy.

This product was ordered twice and both times the product failed to be delivered successfully.  The person still has not received the product which was ordered on December 9th.  I am completely dissatisfied with the Amazon and the abililty to monitor their associated merchants.  It will be the last order I make with Amazon.

I sure wish someone (like Amazon?) could do some data-mining to objectively validate or discard an observation I've made after researching dozens of other reviews of this item.  Compared to the ratings of other coffee makers on Amazon(try Melitta or Cuisinart if you want to check this out yourself), it is fairly obvious that most of the *5-star* ratings for the Zoji are from reviewers who have posted no other reviews.  How many typical consumers go out of their way to rave about a product?I'm now skeptical of a customer rating system that seemed like a great idea.  If one has to do extensive background research on all the reviews of every item they are shopping for, the system has no value at all.I purchased this coffee maker after agonizing over reviews on Amazon and other sites.  The Zoji seemed to rank better overall than most machines with the features I wanted (thermal carafe and automatic brew timer), but after using it for a month or so, I'm sure there must be a better product out there. Honest reviews can be useful, but one needs to take even those with a grain of salt. I realized that one coffeemaker I was considering didn't rank as high as I'd like because some folks were dinging it for making coffee TOO HOT for them.  That reminded me of the well-meaning clerk who once dropped some ice into a cup of freshly brewed coffee because she didn't want me to burn my mouth. I nearly choked trying to stop her before it was too late, but then couldn't say anything because she had been kind enough to brew a single cup of fresh coffee late in the day, just for me. &lt;sigh>So, when I ding the Zoji for not making my coffee hot enough for my tastes (and yes, that includes when I preheat the thermal pot), it may be perfect for you...  IF you drop ice chips into your freshly brewed coffee!!The unit is also very tall, which wasn't completely unexpected, but when the reservoir lid is open, the overall height is indeed extraordinary.Like some of the other reviewers, I experienced coffee overflow when replacing the carafe under the basket after pouring a cup of java in the midst of a brew cycle.  I did discover that if I watched carefully and jiggled the carafe just right, it would interrupt the flow from the basket long enough to let the coffee drain into the carafe and it would then flow without backing up, but what a ridiculous dance to have to perform so early in the morning! I finally resigned myself to waiting for the darned thing to finish brewing, which thankfully isn't long.Finally, what sadist designed the carafe lid?  The grooves across the top, intended to improve grip, are so sharp that one risks shredding their flesh trying to open and close the lid unless they use a towel or potholder to protect their hands.The good?  It brews a good pot of coffee quickly and keeps it as very warm (not hot) as it was for a few hours.  It is easy to clean.I fear I'd have been happier with a Mr. Coffee machine from WalMart for half the price I paid for the Zoji.  I'll use this one as long as I can, though I do plan to take the carafe lid to the basement to sand down the sharp ridges.I may have given the Zoji more stars if the reviews weren't so obviously stacked in its favor.  It is WAY over-rated.

I will never buy a Linksys product again after my experience with this router. I am pretty good with technology, and figured installing a new router would take just a few short minutes (like Linksys says it should) but it took me nearly 2 hours to get it set-up due to the lack of information for Mac set-up as well as the horrible customer service I received. It was clear that customer service had little training with Macs (and were incredibly negative about macs while speaking with them) and were rude. Now that the product is set-up it still doesn't work very well, and even in my very small cottage I can not find a place in the house (even right next to the router) that I get all of my signal bars. I wish I hadn't upgraded at all after my experience with this product, and will never purchase a Linksys router again. Avoid this product, especially if you have a Mac!

This headset works satisfactorily. HOWEVER, the connection is via analog stereo miniplugs, NOT through USB as the product title states.  For an analog connection, the set works well enough.  However, for about $10 more, you can upgrade to the LX-3000, which IS the USB-connecting headset.UPDATE ON 12/8/08: It looks like Amazon fixed the product title, which no longer claims that this headset is USB.  As advertised, then, I would probably up the star rating to a 3 or 4 because these headphones work as you would expect any analog connection to work: sound quality that is just "good" (not great and certainly not crystal clear) and mic quality that is only satisfactory for basic microphone functions where recording quality is not a concern.

I purchased this modem from Amazon because Motorola is currently offering a mail-in rebate through selected retailers.  After I submitted the rebate form, Motorola decline the rebate saying "The UPC symbol or proof-of-purchase tab you submitted is not valid for this promotion".  I ordered the exact model number specified on the rebate form.  How was I supposed to know what UPC code Amazon was going to ship me?Here is the quote from the rebate form - "This offer is valid only on the purchase of a Motorola SURFboard Model SB5101 between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2008, purchased at Fry's Electronics, CompUSA, Office Depot, Radio Shack or Amazon.com."

It took Tracy 8 years to put together the research for her "Method" and this is what she came up with??  I don't even know where to begin. It's not an instruction video, because she doesn't give any instruction!  you have to watch her every second, but here's the trick: sometimes you can't see what she's doing, either because she's behind a chair or because she's in a contorted position on the ground with her legs behind her. Couldn't they have worked the cameras to show the exercises from more than one angle?  This is a terrible video, and if I could return it, I would.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

I've been a Norton user ever since the olden days of Apple: The Mac Performa was the first color computer I ever toyed with.  I had Norton 6 (I believe) and loved it.  It was small, simple, effective.  I used the full Norton software on later PCs and found them to be bloated and memory hogging.  Not worth the money I paid for them at all.Enter Norton 360.I do appreciate the more silent footprint of this new Norton, however, all they did was lessen the GUI's presence.  The bloat is still there, you just don't see it.  Take a simple virus scan for example: I have a dualcore Centrino laptop and just a virus scan brought the poor thing to its knees.  Unacceptable.  Also, the cleanup works TOO well, essentially making Firefox "forget" everything even when you tell it not to.The straw: the heuristic virus protection.  It blocks websites that are in no way dangers to your computer, and deletes software programs that are just updates or patches (not warez).  It assumes something must be dangerous just because it opens a port to function - guess what?  A lot of software might need to do that, including some of Microsoft's own.  It's no big deal.  IT doesn't even prompt you first, it just takes action.I don't recommend this.  If you need total protection look into McAfee instead.

Are you looking for an alternative to microwave popcorn? Then this hot air popper will give a better popping option than the high fat, high sodium contained in microwave popcorn bags.  I've always utilized the proven stovetop method for popping my kernels. How much oil in the bottom? How much kernels to I put in? How long do I wait before I take it off the flame? I have got this method down to a science with no unpopped kernels or burned popcorn through experimenting. It was a lot of trial and error that got me to that point. But I wanted another option to cleaning the oily pan and cover.  And the added benefit of less oil on my popcorn since I need to watch what I ingest now in my older years.The Orville Hot Air Corm Popper was the choice I made over the other brands that utilized hot air and automatic stir methods. A few friends had these brands and did not like restricted user operator options. The plastic cover on this model is made of high intensity, heat resistant Polycarbonate that will get hot but not melt with consistent usage.  Please read the instructions, how to use and safeguards before operating this unit because this appliance contains a high intense heat element.  I never put more than the recommended  cup kernels in the hot air chamber. The  cup is located on top of the unit which also melts room temperature butter while popping. Put the kernels in the popping chamber and then plug in the unit. (There is no on/off switch so don't leave this unit unattended.) The kernels will start taking the intense heat generated and will start to pop in about a minute. At this point a few kernels might fly out the shoot because of the forced hot air, but if a 4 quart bowl is used under the chute they will land in there. The popcorn will start to fill up the chamber and spill over into the bowl at rapid pace. It will help if the bowl is turned a few times so one side does not fill up. Once all of the popcorn comes out there will be about 5-10 kernels left still rotating in the hot air. At this point unplug the unit and let it cool. If the unit is left on to try to get all of the kernels popped they will start firing out the chute like hot  BB projectiles.   The popcorn can know be enjoyed with any toppings of choice. I like that I can control what I put on my popcorn. I do like real butter with a little popcorn salt and freshly grated Parmesan or store bought popcorn flavorings. I melt my refrigerated butter in the microwave for about 20 seconds. I once tried to put the flavorings on during popping, but only got them blown all over the floor, lesson learned once again. I would recommend this popper to everyone who wants a fast method of popping corn who wants to control what they have on their fresh, homemade, delicious popcorn.

Dog training is about consistency, and this product is simply inconsistent. I live in a neighborhood with a lot of other dogs. I bought this product to solve a simple issue, my dog tries to take off after other dogs while on a leash. He is a large, strong willed German Shepherd. In order to be effective I had to use this device at about level 7 or 8 or he ignored it. At this level the battery life was quite minimal lasting me about 3 days at best. Lithium button cells are not inexpensive, it uses 2 and in just a couple of months time I'd spent more on batteries than the device cost me. They are also inconvenient to change, requires a screwdriver. Too many times I went to rely on this training device and it simply failed, dead batteries again. having to frustratingly switch gears to deal with the problem only encourages the bad behavior since it takes you out of the calm controlling posture required to be effective. I eventually gave up on it. Good concept, bad design. Would have been much better if it used less expensive, more common alkalines or rechargables.

I have to admit that I was hesistant at first to go see this - I thought it would likely be silly & shallow & leave my brain aching for substance, and I wasn't keen on seeing a movie based on toys my little brother used to play with. But, man was I wrong!! This movie is awesome! It is very cool, the special effects are out of this world, the acting is superb, the drama kept me rapt, and the best parts were that this movie was funny, moving and has a huge heart. For the modern audience who has seen a lot, this movie delivers. There are very few DVDs I will actually buy, but this is definitely one of them - the order is already in with Santa! Seriously, this movie is so touching, funny, ultra-cool and edge of your seat action-packed, we all left with huge smiles on our faces. I love you Bumblebee & Optimus Prime!!

First off I would just like to say to the true fans of the Twilight Saga this is a amazing novel which is every bit as powerful as the previous three. To those who have been bashing it non-stop since its release quit trying to call yourselves fans and find another series to dump on.This novel is my favorite in the series and everything tied together so nicely. To those having a problem with Jacob imprinting on Bella's daughter get your minds out of the gutter and quit jumping to horrible and nasty conclusions. If you were true fans you would have noticed that Quil also imprinted on a child and that their relationship is nothing sexual. It eventually would turn to that when the child reaches the age of the werewolf. I mean come on Jacob is just like a big brother to "Nessie" and there is nothing wrong with having a big brother.To all those who have said that Bella and Edwards romance is not such a big part in this book it is. I mean the story does center around them. The story could not be completely all lovey dovey the entire time just because they got what they wanted. Stephenie Meyer was trying to make the relationship as real as possible. They have problems they have to worry about.Then there is the Bella's daughter thing that everyone keeps freaking out about. Its was a nice inclusion into the story line and after the Character became more dominate I warmed up to her very well. Everyone on all the message boards are going on and on about how vampire's cannot have children and all that bull, but come on it is a fiction novel. Plus when it was stated that "Vampires could never have children" the key word being vampires it never said anything about a Vampire and a Human. This makes perfect sense since Bella and Edward are one of a kind. They have a relationship it is a loving relationship not a predator and prey thing.So all in all this was a excellent way to end the series.  The story flowed well together and gave new insight into certain characters. For all those Jacob haters out there (I was one of them) the section of the book that is narrated by him gives new insight to his character and made me beging to like Jacob for the first time since the series began.Stephenie Meyer did a excellent job finishing her beautiful series and offering two unforgettable lovers that I think will go down in history as two famous fictional lovers. To those hating this book, make up your own ending and quit putting down the author...I don't see any of you writing bestselling novels. I would recommend this book to any and evryone who enjoys a good story that  is powerful and emotional. It is a perfct way to end a beloved series. READ THIS BOOK!!! Quit listening to all the haters who went in reading the book just trying to find its flaws.

Many of the recent SciFi shows fall into two categories: stupid (Voyager, Enterprise, Andromeda) or boring (Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Firefly).It took Ron Moore (a veteran of the greatest SciFi show of all times - Deep Space Nine) to rejuvenate an entire genre.The new Battlestar Galactica is the exact opposite of the old one - it's adult, gritty, dark and sophisticated.It's an intelligent show for intelligent people.With so much garbage on TV today it surprised a lot of people that the best TV show right now comes from a genre that is looked down upon by so many.The ratings are fantastic and the show will be on for a long time - so if you haven't watched it on TV then buy this DVD set.Otherwise you'll be missing the greatest thing on TV right now.

I really liked Twilight (never as good as any of the HPs, but it was a good book), but after New Moon I knew I would hate the rest of the series-- and I do! I hope Meyers would fix all the problems in her storyline, but it seems her mind- at least in writing this series is as weak and flawed as her characters! I suppose it all was just a weak rip off of Wuthering Heights and Romeo and Juliet, but it lacks enough back-story to allow the reader to understand why so many of the characters are so pathetic, especially the main character, Isabella. You'll end up not liking her more so than sympathizing with her, and her man, Edward goes from being the sharp, keen type, to a pillar to hold up the asinine Bella.**Series Recap**Bella is totally pathetic, she's a weak, selfish, flimsy woman. She falls for the VAMPIRE WHO TRIES TO NO AVAIL TO CONVINCE HER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. He leaves her to protect her, but she will only allow herself to believe he left because she is so worthless! (Which, as the series goes on, you may believe she is.) Through the series Bella laments time and time again, how unworthy she is, and constantly has some man to remind her of her importance! If you have a daughter with any kind of self-esteem issue PLEASE KEEP THESE BOOKS AWAY FROM HER!! Bella uses the young and innocent Native American (Jacob) as a crutch to survive her depression. She knows he loves her but won't deny herself the relief she gets from presence even though she knows she her only love is the vampire (Edward).Jacob risks his life time and time again to protect her, he's called to duty in the first place because of her relationship with Edward. Despite all Jacob gives to Bella as soon as Edward needs her she tosses Jacob to the side to rescue Edward. When Edward vows to never leave her again, she more or less forgets Jacob, there are some extenuating circumstances but still she does not put up the fight for him that she put up to have Edward in her life. She disrespects her father, lies to her mother, and does all the things that would break any parent's heart to be with the vampire, and no matter how much she'll think of her poor parents, they're always some kind of afterthought. Granted, in the first book she tries to save her mom, but you'll soon see, if confronted with the idea of leaving Edward to spare them, she'll leave them to have Edward.Bella refuses to accept that she cannot have both Edward and Jacob as they are mortal enemies, she's determined to have things her way and actually feels like Jacob is wrong for not giving her what she wants, which is to be her best friend while she loves the vampire...to make matter worse Jacob's people have always existed to protect mankind, while Edward is just an oddity who no-longer tries to destroy humanity. Through the series Bella causes trouble time and time again, but is always rescued. She never develops any self-esteem or any ability to take care of herself. At one point, she actually risks her life just to have delusions of Edward. She doesn't care about how her parents, or Jacob, who she uses to help induce these hallucinations, would feel if she died. She doesn't even care that she could be risking Jacob's life too! She abandons her friends and her family to be with Edward, who never really requested that of her. Edward has to fight with her to attend college, he has to beg her to have a normal human but she desires nothing more than to give it all up. She fears marrying Edward, but is dying to give up her soul to be a vampire; she at one point rationalizes that if she were a vampire, Edward would never want to leave her again...does that make any sense? Her value relies on rather or not a man- a vampire wants her, a horrible self-esteem lesson for every young girl, in a world where you hear of the abuse against women almost daily! A woman fought to be present, while books such as these teach young adult woman, a man is the beginning and ending of existence. I know it's a fantasy book, but books are meant as educational tools in one way or another. In Harry Potter the message is persistence, faith and overcoming, in Wuthering Heights it's a lesson on karma, and to do unto others etc...Meyers gave her characters a happy ending they didn't deserve--and if they did deserve it, it's never explained why they did. She uses four pages, every time she mentions Edwards's name to explain his beauty, but practically never explains why he'd crave human love. Simply because he's a vampire isn't enough, because there are plenty of other vampires who get along fine, without love. Is it because he's lonely? She doesn't explain it, but in a way that's too bad too, if he were truly interested in Bella's well being and enjoying what he missed out on--a life. His actions however clearly show that's not the case either, so what? Is he just selfish? Hardly the kind of character you'd want to have a happy ending.In the end she marries Edward, coaxes him into sex, gets pregnant which according to Meyers own outline should have been impossible. She's a young mom, who must hide the dramatic time from her own mother, who she professes to love so very much. She has the kid, and accepts and expects Jacob to protect it, but then gets angry when he does so the best way he knows how. Never mind the fact, that he is still in love with her, she's inconsiderate! She won't have him, but won't let him go either! And finally Bella and Edward live happily ever after!It's a sick, sick series! You wouldn't know it by the first book, you'd believe it's a coming of age thing, that Bella will mature, and that you will see her relationship with Edward and Jacob actually gain some substance. Through the series, you're never given any actual reason for the love, not between Ed and Bella or between Jake and Bella. With Edward especially is seems more like lust or some kind of spell, because all she can ever talk about his how handsome, beautifully angelic he is and how his smell makes her forget her thoughts, how his breath lulls her to sleep-- total nonsense.I know a love story is dramatic, heart wrenching, and usually someone gets jilted, but she takes it to a mental level. It should have some practical basis, or some redeeming qualities. It should make you believe in it, or admire something about it. In the case of The Meyers Series, all she gives you is a self-centered teenage girl who is incapable of not only taking care of herself, but Bella can't even spare others her destruction because she chooses not to. It also sends the message that all little girls need in life, is a man and a baby, and I've wondered if that comes from Meyer's Mormon upbringing? I do not mean to insult any religion, and I do not know anything about Meyers other than what I've read, but this series she's created is truly horrific. It exemplifies some sort of misogynistic idea; women, Bella is clearly the weaker, albeit more manipulative sex.Spare yourself the trouble, read something else. I usually don't write reviews but this series was so idiotic that I had to say something. I know it's just a book and I know it's a fantasy, but just as we try to hold TV and music responsible for the messages, they send to the youth we must do the same with what our children read. It's problem enough to talk about losing your soul, it's another to happily give it up, but when you add in destructiveness, selfishness, mental illness in the form of self-esteem issues, you have a serious problem that doesn't need to be shared.

If you're reading this review I assume you're looking for a game controller, perhaps one similar in feel to the PS and PS2 controllers and that you want the analog stick (though for other creative uses, see some of the other reviews people have written).  I didn't specifically buy this controller because it was wireless (though I appreciated this future much after I got it), for me it was between this one and a few other similar Logitech models that didn't offer wireless or rumble support (to be honest I never used the rumble support anyway).  My friends had another Logitech controller (I believe the Logitech Dual Action Gamepad) which I thought was fine, but I read on Amazon and heard from others that the control stick broke to easily, so I decided to shell out a few extra bucks for this one, and I've been happy.  It's great for emulators.It's noticeably heavier than it's wired and non-rumble counterparts, but it's never uncomfortable to use, and the wirelessness is really nice, especially when playing a four player game on a computer when you want people to be able to walk by easily or not get the cords all tangled.  I've never had any problems with this, never needed to install it on any computer, and never had any problems with it being recognized by the USB unit, which always detects it just fine.  And the battery life seems great (I've been using it quite a bit, and haven't had to replace the batteries yet, which were thankfully included).  It's also very portable (even though it has two parts to it) and very comfortable to use.Note to Mac users: The Amazon page says it's OS X compatible, but the actual product said no such thing on it, but it worked for me, so I suppose it really is OS X compatible and Amazon is correct.  More specifically, I primarily use this on my friend's pc when we play games, but I tried it on my MacBook (it's an Intel Mac) running OS X and although the operating system didn't seem to detect it, the controller worked just fine with applications that recognized it, such as certain emulators.

I've had this camera for over a month. The video quality is excellent, sharp with great color. Excellent portability, almost dissapears in your hand. This is truly a take everywhere camera. You will alway have it with you so you won't miss those great video oportunities. Likes*Starts up fast. *Video sharp with great color. You will love the color*Audio is great but if you take it to a concert turn down the gain it is very sensitive.*small, easy to carry*MJPEG can be edited in most computersSome notes:If you want to see what this camera can do, go to the vimeo website and search for TX1. I use Vegas Movie Studio to edit with no problem. The gorrila pod suggested is not great for video because the camera will wobble with any wind or bump. A walking stick type monopod is excellent though. Just an incredibly fun camera!

I love the SwaddleMe swaddlers. My newborn daughter slept so much better through the night when we swaddled her snugly. This product kept the swaddle secure with velcro closures. Also, it was easy to do diaper changes because you could keep baby's arms swaddled while you pull down the bottom part. We used the cotton knit during warm summer nights and the plush, microfleece swaddler for cooler nights to keep our little darling snug and warm.

I bought this camera thinking that it would be an improvement over my Fuji S6000fd digital camera (it records movies as well). I use it to record my sons wrestling matches. The video is just as grainy and ugly as my digital camera if not worse. Maybe this camcorder will work well outside but if you're thinking of using it indoors, look elsewhere.

Windows Live is fast and easy to upload. I would say it is very comparable with other virus scan products. My laptop is running faster and Windows Live has found viruses I wouldn't have thought possible. And since I have Windows Vista, this product is perfect!On a side note, the packaging is very hard to open. I had to use a lot of force to open the plastic box. Perhaps in the future, Windows should make the packaging easier to open. As for the price, well, for a one time deal it is great but beware of the continue license to use and other secret money making options.Katiebabs

First--I am new to the Twilight Saga, and I've decided to review these books in order, as I read them.Second--I'll admit I genuinely enjoyed the first book, Twilight, despite its flaws (which one only has to peruse the numerous 1-star reviews for to get a sense of what those flaws are). I gave it a fair 3-star review, just for the sheer FUN I had reading it.So why am I giving New Moon only 2 stars?1) I realize I'm not the first to point out that Stephanie Meyer's first-person style of writing often reads like a glorified fan fiction.  Indeed, I have read numerous fan fictions that invoke many of the same characteristics that seem to be ubiquitous in Meyer's writing: inane details, unimaginative surroundings, lengthy paragraphs describing feelings and emotions, too-convenient circumstances, and ridiculous plot devices--all told from a very "Mary Sue" type of perspective. However, I was hoping Meyer had gotten most of these things out of her system in Twilight, but they regrettably return in New Moon, to an even more laughable degree.2) The story in this book really let me down. Without giving too much away: We finally get to see Bella on her own, left to her own devices, making her own choices. And I kept waiting for her to get ANGRY at her situation; to finally grow a spine and be the independent girl I was hoping she'd be. But it never happened.  I thought Edward's decision in the beginning would take this series an in an entirely new direction; allowing Bella to flourish in her freedom and pursue her new found desires. Instead we get chapter after chapter of suicidal thoughts, reckless behavior, using people, lying, and hallucinations, all for the sake of someone who, in my opinion, does not deserve her affections. It felt utterly pathetic to watch this unfold. 3) By the end of the book, I had the nagging feeling that this series has already long since "jumped the shark" and that New Moon was just Twilight's extended denouement. I enjoyed Jacob's story (even though its emergence could not have possibly been more predictable) but couldn't help but feel that it was all filler. I was almost certain all the involvement with Jacob was going to build up to and play a major role in this book's climax, but no. Instead we get an angsty and entirely self-inflicted pointless conflict so ridiculous that it almost seems like Meyer went out of her way to allow it to happen. And just as ridiculously, it was all swept under the rug and forgiven with very little action or consequences.So why did I read New Moon? And why do I plan to read the next 2 books?  Why do I have an infuriating desire to WANT to like these books?  The correct answer, I suspect, is a carefully-mixed cocktail of brilliant marketing, movie hype, and a basic storyline that is specifically meant to appeal to readers of literature's lowest common denominator--trashy romance novels.  Yet I will keep reading because, despite my complaints, I do care about the characters Meyer has created, even if I don't care for the way she writes them; which seems to be without subtlety or any true depth.  There have been so many times in these first 2 books that the story has hinted at taking an interesting or unexpected turn, but instead continues along its predictable and unimaginative path. I sincerely hope that things will get better in the next 2 books.

I was excited at the chance to buy any dragon naturally speaking, and expected to buy version 9.  when i went looking, i found new release version 10...read some reviews, compared versions, etc for several days before purchasing.first, it took 8 days for it to arrive in the mail, too long.  read the manual 1 day 1st before even trying to intall software - the book is very skimpy and doesnt address troubleshooting, but then it doesnt even have the company's website listed on/in it...that should have been a sign.then ive been frustrated for 3 days trying to install this software.  nuance help files, faq, and especially the index are absolutely horrible.  and yes, they say they will charge you for any help, whether by phone or email, which is absolutely stupid after paying 190$ for the software in the first place.1st problem was the C++ runtime/reboot error, where repeated rebooting doesnt fix the problem.  the nuance knowledgebase had several possible fixes, including a zip download, none worked.  i found a forum elsewhere that said to just go to C:/program files folder and look for the new dragon folder to delete it (bcs install was created and started, but not finished, so you wont lose anything anyway), and sure enough that solved the problem.  rebooting and running dvd again then installed the c++ runtime that was needed.2nd problem then was trying to install the dragon naturally speaking.  it started installing, then some english cab file has an invalid digital signature, and instead of passing over it or using it anyway, it "rolled back" and wouldnt install any of the files.  at least this error had a code "1330", which nuance knowledgebase had listed, and their solution 1 (of 3) worked, which is that you have to copy the entire dvd to your harddrive desktop, then run the install from the desktop instead.  3rd, then even while doing this, it wouldnt copy one of the .ini files, so i just was able to skip it.  finally the software installed.  happy days, i thought.i then tried to run it.  a "serious error" occurs when trying to initialize and run.  no code numbers, no other info, and no clue as to what a "serious error" means or what to do about it.  ARRRGGHHH !the stupid nuance index was clueless for a bit, but finally on the index word "initialization", i found the tech response.  a cpu must be able to use SSE2.  never heard of it, but wikipedia helped.  end result is that your cpu has to be built since 2006 to have sse2 capability.  there is no way to add SSE2 instructions to any other types of cpu/chips.  so, altho i have an 1.8 gh amd processor, which is what is stated in the minimum requirements, my processor was built in 2003 and thus is incapable of ever running this software.++so, if you have an older-than-2006 cpu, or also if you have such a new cpu that it runs 64-bit, DONT BUY THIS SOFTWARE, you'll never get to use it.  this SSE2 requirement SHOULD HAVE been included in the CPU requirements both on amazon's site as well as on nuance's site so that you would check this stuff out before purchasing and returning software.  after finding this error, i did find another tech forum that addressed using dragon n s 10 and SSE2 requirement that is kept a big secret by nuance, and they suggested too, that nuance should either put it on their website, or on their box, or in their manual, or in their knowledgebase, or somewhere.  i agree, as i wasted 3 days of time over something that i knew about my computer, had it just been listed somewhere as a requirement.but any company that charges for tech support for even the initial installing when you pay 200$ or more for the software, especially when they dont have a sufficient troubleshooting knowledgebase, is a company that i dont care to do business with.  i am returning this product, and i better get my f*&(*&#$g refund from these screwy people.

I received this as a gift to replace an older food processor that I purchased for $5 at a yard sale.  I was excited to upgrade to a larger capacity model with more power, but I have been very disappointed.  This food processor is heavy, somewhat complicated to put together and take apart, and nearly impossible to clean.  There are many nooks that get food in them, and are impossible to reach with a sponge. I have also had a lot of problems with the food processor leaking when I'm pureeing soups and sauces.  If my old food processor still worked I would go back to using it, and sell this one at a garage sale for $5.

If you're used to faster than 900 speed you'll be disappointed when you expect this machine to function as your desktop does. Have researched CPU upgrades and they are minimal.  No easy upgrades available because the CPU seems sodered in to the motherboard so upgrades require alot of work.

Perhaps I just got a lemon, but I just spent 4 hours trying to get this thing working, with no success. I have set up several other Linksys wireless routers as well as a Dlink wireless router in the past, so it's not as if I don't know what I'm doing. But I just can't figure out what this thing's problem is.For one thing, the setup disc that was included with the router only works a small percentage of the time. Most of the time, when I had my laptop plugged into the router via ethernet cable (as the setup program instructs you to do), when you get to step 4, which is "plug the router's power cable into the electrical outlet", the setup program will sit for five to ten minutes only to tell me that my ethernet cable is not properly connected. Uhh, what? I eventually found out that if I re-run the setup program and/or reboot my laptop several times, it will get past that problem, only to get to another problem:I get to the point where the setup program asks me to input settings for SSID, router login/password, and security (I tried, WEP and WPA, as well as unsecured). I do all that, and from that point forward, nothing will connect to the router via wireless connection. I tried my laptop, my ipod touch, and my blackberry, none of them were ever able to connect. Ethernet connection works, but no wireless. I also noticed that the wireless indicator light on the router will mysteriously stop illuminating until I power cycle the router. Perhaps this is part of the problem. Windows suggests it's a weak wireless signal, but I'm never more than ten feet away from the router.But wait, there's more. Once I get the network set up via the setup disc, I can no longer access the router config page (192.168.1.1) from my browser. I can access it before I run the setup, but not after. It prompts me for my name and password, I enter them and hit enter, and it simply brings up the login window again, as if I typo'd. I tried the default login here, but that didn't work either. So again I have to reset the router with the reset button on the back.After 4 hours wasted on trying to get this piece of crap working, I gave up. There is no way in hell I should be running into this many problems. Like I said, I have setup several wireless networks in the past, most of them Linksys, and one Dlink. They were all very painless, none of them took me anymore than 1/2 hour to set up a secured network from scratch. So this piece of crap is getting exchanged for either a Linksys WRT54G or a DLink (can't recall the model number offhand), both are G routers that I recently setup for relatives, and I was able to get my laptop, ipod touch and blackberry connected to them without a single issue.UPDATE: I was able to get the router working for about half an hour, by simply moving it to where it was approximately five feet away from my laptop rather than ten feet. Only thing I can figure is something where I had originally placed it was interfering with the signal. However, after half an hour, I suddenly lost net connection, and the router disappeared from the list of wireless devices, so I was unable to reconnect to it. All the lights were illuminated on the router, yet it just disappeared to where neither my laptop, ipod touch, or my friend's iphone could no longer see it. That's the final straw. This piece of junk is getting returned. Horrible, horrible product.

For all those who criticize this product by comparing it to a Windows Laptop, I am sorry by you are wrong.This is an Ultra Mobile Personal Computer.  If you want a computer for on-the-go, to use Skype for WiFi calls, a real Browser (Firefox), and the ability read/edit/send all Office documents, this is it.Yes, the keyboard is cramped, yes, the screen is small.  It weighs 2lbs, and for the price it is a 5-star winner.  If the price were $700, this device deserves to be heavily criticized.  It is $299.Can't go wrong with this!

We were pleased with the auto on feature and this model worked great for us until one day it just refused to begin brewing.It had power, the buttons were working but it simply would not kick on and brew another pot of coffee. We only use it once a day and were disappointed that it was dead. We are still not sure exactly what stopped working but we are in talks with Black & Decker to get it replaced.

In the interest of helping out other cat lovers, I am posting this review. I threw away three perfectly operational LitterMaid automatic cat boxes when I saw how well this worked, and then I ordered a second one of these.It works just like they say, and if you use FLUSHABLE litter, not only do you spare yourself the nastiness of having to bend over and chisel cat poop off the appliance/litter box (due to the great engineering of this catbox), you don't have to carry a ninety pound back of you know what out to the trash, making the trash collectors hate you when the bag breaks (because you carried the slide out drawer with huge handle to the toilet and flushed it).It now takes 30 seconds to clean my cat box, and is 98% less disgusting. We no longer fight about whose turn it is, because I don't mind doing it.Added bonus: unlike the Littermaid, you never, ever have to buy accessories for it.

After about a month or so of using it as directed on the bottle, we started to notice a real difference in tear staining.  No more crusty build-up around the eyes.  It doesn't prevent the tearing completely, but there's no longer any red/brown colored stain.  Any tearing dries up clear.  We had no digestion problems or refusal to eat it.  We found it easiest to mix the Angel Eyes powder with some wet food so that everything gets consumed.  Overall very satisfied.

This is the most formulaic summer movie I have ever seen.  Stuffed full with celebrity cameos, overblown special effects, and blatant product placement.  It's more a 2 1/2 hour GM commercial than a film. The characters are all one dimensional and the plot is predictable so I never really got into the film.  I know for sure I will never watch a Michael Bay movie again having been disapointed for the last time.  Also Shia LaBeouf is the most ridiculous leading actor in a movie since DJ Qualls in "The New Guy".

My dad's cardiologist recommended getting a blood pressure monitor for the house to check his pressure regularly.  He suggested the arm-cuff type was better (lower variance in the readings) than the wrist-cuff version.  So, we got the Omron HEM-780.  It's a little marvel:  It's very easy to use, it's fast, and it's so compact that it fits in the medicine cabinet.  At least a couple of times my dad's blood pressure hiked up unexpectedly and this little monitor took the guesswork out of both occasions -- he adjusted his meds as per his doctor's instructions -- without need for emergency care.  I would very highly recommend it.

I have been using generic minoxidil 5% from various suppliers for years. Recently, I ordered the 4-month package supplied by Kirkland. Guess what, after a month, my hair started to fall again. Although on the label, it is 5% minoxidil, there's no way for me to test whether it has 5% minoxidil or not... So I stopped using this one and quickly ordered another generic minoxidil from a different supplier and my hair loss seems slow down now. So conclusion: I will never buy minoxidil from Kirkland anymore.

I used TurboTax in 2006 for the first time with no complaints. Then again, my return was pretty simple. I basically bought it because I am no good with numbers and felt safer having a double check for myself.This year I purchased again and it was horrible! My return was more complex, having purchased a home and having multiple work deductions. All said and done, TurboTax told me I owed about $1100! After a moment of panic, I called a lifelong CPA who was a friend of a friend and took the same documents in to him. Looking over TurboTax's work he was amazed. He told me it was all wrong. Numbers were in some forms and not others, the wrong forms had been used, and some things I could have deducted weren't there at all because TurboTax's "Deduction Maximizer" didn't tell me I could.All said and done, we saved over $500 by his redoing our taxes and got tips on getting more back next year. Plus he E-filed for free. TurboTax charges you $18 for that. In addition, their customer service stinks. I have a hard time finding someone to speak English and when I asked about the "Satisfaction Guarenteed" refund he started asking for my private information to "pull my record."

My favorite Disney Pixar movie of all time is Toy Story and now I can say that it is WALL*E. If you enjoy the Pixar movies, you will love this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of animation, I whole heartily recommend you go see WALL*E. As an adult I was taught a lesson. When a child and adult can leave a movie together and talk about the same things they watched and ask questions, that is really an amazing thing.Synopsis: What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL*E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL*E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL*E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion. Joining WALL*E on his journey across the universe is a cast of characters including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.The first few minutes of WALL*E are a bit depressing. Earth is a vast wasteland of garbage. And when I say wasteland, I mean that in the literal sense. Humans have left Earth because of the output of garbage, waste and abuse to the environment. The year is 2775 and all that remains are skyscrapers, filth and waste. As I sat there, the six year turns to me and asks what has happened to the Earth? Why all the garbage? I honestly have no answer for him and as he turns back to look at the screen he says, garbage is very bad. Things become a bit lighter as we see WALL*E on the screen. The character of WALL*E is so very much like a child. He sees things as a child would. Even though his job is to clean up the garbage the best he can, he likes to collect things such as Rubik Cubes, light bulbs and utensils. WALL*E has such an incredible personality that shows he is not just a mindless robot. He enjoys watching an old time 1950's musical and loves the music and the dancing. He especially enjoys watching one scene over and over again where a man and woman are holding hands and sing to each other. WALL*E assumes love means holding hands; but he has no one to hold hands with.EVE comes down to Earth with a directive in mind. She reminded me of a mutant egg, but quickly just as WALL*E tugged at my heart, EVE will do the same with you. WALL*E welcomes her with open arms, so very happy he has another to share his toys with. He assumes she will want to stay with him and perhaps she will be the one to finally hold his hand. (The hand holding becomes very important throughout the movie) But WALL*E has in his possession what EVE is searching for. WALL*E has found a small plant growing out of all the waste and gives it to EVE. By plant life beginning to grown on Earth again after hundreds of years, that means humans can return to their home and begin a new.EVE is taken back to her ship and WALL*E follows her because he thinks she is in danger. EVE is sent back to a huge giant like cruise spaceship where humans live as if they are on permanent vacation. Another disturbing fact is that because robots do everything for humans, humans have become big lazy blobs who ride around in chairs as they drink fatting shakes and watching TV very oblivious to life around them. When the Captain of the ship receives the plant, it means they can return home to Earth. But his co-pilot, which is a robot and so very much like HAL from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey has specific instructions that humans can not return to Earth. It takes over the ship's controls and tries to stop WALL*E and EVE from placing the plant in a certain part of the ship that will enable them to go back to Earth.So many lessons were taught and learned in this simple animated movie. It is heartbreaking to think in hundreds of years, Earth may no longer be inhabitable by living things and we would have to leave to travel in space with no meaning. WALL*E in some ways is very much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and as an adult I laughed at so many hidden jokes that came straight from the movie. But like 2001, there is hope and in WALL*E even though things look hopeless, that is not the case. Even though Earth is devastated, things can change. By the end of WALL*E my depression that I felt at the beginning of the movie became a feeling of hope. You must stay till the very end and watch the closing credits because as Peter Gabriel sings, we see through very amateur drawings how humans can make Earth so very green again because of a robot who should have no feelings or personality was able to deliver one small plant that will become the roots for a future of hope.Katiebabs

This drive worked just fine, except that after about 6 months and with 93 gigabytes stored in it, it failed.  Quite an inconvenience.  Fortunately I was able to recover the 93 gigs, a slow process though.  (Thank God I had not come close to loading  a full terabyte onto it.) I think I had one external drive fail before, years ago, but certainly not after 6 months (or less, actually) of use.  I can't recommend this drive.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I had originally heard about the series from some of my friends- several of which were reading it- so I took it out from the library and was instantly hooked. I bought the second and third (New Moon and Eclipse) so I wouldn't have to wait for them to come through the library. I even pre-ordered the fourth (Host, scheduled to come out in May) before I had started the second. Even though I'm not a huge fan of most science fiction or fantasy, I really liked the vampire spin on reality. It made it believable as opposed to just some stupid book about vampires and other nonsense. The vampire, Edward, is so incredibly alluring and intriguing that you are pulled in and just want to learn more and more about him like and insatiable hunger. Then there's Bella, someone you instantly fall in love with.I highly recommend this book for everyone. Even if you don't normally like science fiction, you'll be surprised- it's very believable.

The 80's were particularly bad for Disney. After sailing to the massive heights of Cinderella, Bambi, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, Disney was now making films such as Black Cauldron, Oliver & Company and Great Mouse Detective which didn't do the greatest of business. So Little Mermaid comes out and while box-office wise not as massive as Lion King or Aladdin, put the company back on track again. I wouldn't call it Disney's best but it's certainly highly enjoyable, surprisingly affecting and a better movie than you'd think.Taking place in the ocean's depths, Ariel is a 16 year old mermaid who's fascinated by the surface world. Her father, King Triton, forbids any contact and is especially mad when Ariel falls for a prince named Eric. Wanting to be with him, Ariel strikes a deal with sea witch Ursula: get Eric to give her true love kiss and she'll remain a human forever, or she'll belong to Ursula. With the help of friends Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle, Ariel has to break the spell in 3 days.What's incredibly surprising about Little Mermaid is that there's very little pacing problems. Unlike let's say, Hercules or Hunchback of Notre Dame which, while good, had a couple slow parts, there's rarely a scene that just feels long. If it's not the story that's catching you, it's a catchy song and the movie's full of them. To the emotional Part of Your World to the renowned Under the Sea the film has uplifting music that even you'll get in your head. And when you have frogs singing verses on Kiss the Girl, that's charming and a great song.One thing that surprised me about the transfer was while brighter than the old releases, it didn't have that lush colorful feel like Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Does the film have any problems? Um, well couple of the animation scenes are spotty, including backgrounds that look too painted and shifting character designs. One minute, Ariel is beautiful and stunning than she'll have this weird look to her where she looks off-kilter to other scenes. And even though he redeems himself, King Triton is arguably the worst father I've seen in a Disney film, instead of being overprotective, he comes across as almost militant-like.Since this is going back into the dreaded "Vault" I'd suggest getting this quick. It's a great film, not only for kids but just for casual viewing. By the way, I believe the next ones are either Peter Pan, 101 Dalmations and Jungle Book.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

Last night a friend invited me to watch the DVD with him and his two kids - aged 10 and 14. The 14 year old saw Dark Knight 6 times in the theater.In watching, I was reminded of the terror wrought in Mumbai a couple of weeks ago. The whole world was shocked and disgusted by the senseless killing spree perpetrated by a gang of thugs hyped up on drugs and somehow convinced that shooting and stabbing innocent people supported their "cause". I suppose if a film crew was able to recreate the Mumbai melee and amp it up with state of the art special effects and high definition, explosions, pounding music and high profile actors, the resulting movie would be huge hit. It bothers me that violence and evil are such a huge attraction for mainstream audiences, especially our younger generation. That they're all "gaga" over Heath Ledger and his portrayal of the criminally sadistic Joker - and his subsequent suicide - is a sad testament to what's important to our youth today, and who they look up to.  In summary, I can't imagine how much better I would have felt if I had taken a walk down at the beach and watched the sunset instead of spending two and a half hours with this movie that left me feeling awful.

I languished over the reviews of the currently available Mini's and after reading all I could find the playing field was pretty much the same. Atom 1.6 processor except HP but they were ruled out early for price bloat. I won't spend $700.00+ for a UMPC, to me that defeats the purpose. To me a Ultra Portable is used as a supplement to a full fledged Laptop not to replace it. So after studying the contestants I made my criteria for selection. The O.S. had to be Windows XP for its combination of low system demands and its compatibility with everyday programs such as Word. Next I decided that it needed a traditional hard drive not the more expensive low capacity flash derivatives that aren't discernibly faster. Third was battery life and last but seemingly more important was the aesthetics. I wanted it to look cool because I knew it would draw attention amongst my co-workers. I came down to the MSI Wind and the Acer One. I am a big fan of the glossy screen technology and of a exterior that has the bling appeal. The MSI has the Matte screen and a Matte exterior, boring!So the Acer Won or should I say One. But only in the 160 gig 6 cell battery version. It's not that anyone would need the 160 gig drive but that is how the Win.XP, 6 cell battery version comes packaged which is ok by me. The bling is spot on! The exterior is a deep Metallic Blue...and is just outstanding to look at. Yeah you'll leave finger prints like all the reviewers noted but guess what I just used a old, (but clean) sock and Wala!! wiped them off in ohh maybe 5 seconds!! Christ these reviewers are wimpy. It boots into XP faster than any desktop I've owned, repaired or built, &lt; than 30 seconds. The six cell battery sticks out from the rear of the case but does not make it look odd and the extended battery life is worth it! Five hours on a charge, thats unheard of with traditional Laptops. It acquires my wireless access very quickly and surfs with all the speed my router pushes out. I didn't bother getting an external C/D drive to install any programs that I had on C/D. I just plugged in my 4 gig USB drive into my desktop machine and copied the installation C/D I needed onto it. Then plugged the USB thumb drive into my Acer One and double clicked the installation .exe and away it went. It also has a built in web cam wich is pretty cool. Works fine but of course it's not your 30 frame a second hand held, but its fine for getting freaky with your g/f if shes off on a business trip.Probably the best function with this is to get a Wireless plan through your cell provider so you can connect anywhere your phone has service but there plans are so dam expensive!I really like this Mini, it's well worth the $399 price tag. Thats what Amazon sells them for when they have them in stock, crazy sweet deal. Don't pay the extra $100 that places like Tiger have jacked it up to, just wait Amazon will get more. Newegg will treat you right as well.If your in the market for a mini, the Acer Aspire One will not disappoint!! Remember the Blue is just Killer.

If you're reading this and considering a 600 thread count sheet set, I assume you are looking for quality.  This sheet set is far from it.  I thought I was making a good purchase when I ordered this, comparing it with lots of other 600 count sets, and this seemed to be the best deal for the dollar.  After the second washing, the fitted sheet developed pills all over it.  It became the most uncomfortable thing to sleep on and only having purchased it just a couple of months ago, I've had to get rid of it.Very disappointed.

This mouse is not perfect but I would have given it a 4.5 so I upgraded it to a 5.For my large hands this mouse feels just right. It moves well on my nylon mat that I use for a pad and I have tried it on a hardwood desktop with good results. The mouse has very good yaw and pitch movement and it is easy to adjust dpi setting on the fly.It has a quick turn feature that works very well in first person shooters. you assign one of the buttons for quick turn around and as your playing if you want to check who's behind you click the button and you turn 180 degree's. If you need to change your direction fast because you can see your out numbered ahead it comes in mighty handy.The top buttons have a good responsive click to them and I had no problem with learning the over and under side buttons, which I perfer over my old Logitec MX518 foward and aft configuration.The weight of this mouse without adding extra weights feels about the same as the MX518. I choose to add 5 grams of weight to it and perfer it that way.The mouse wheel has a micro feeling touch and a little too light for my taste, but I got use to it fairly quickly. The one feature I think would have made this a great mouse would to have put side push switching on the wheel for adjusting look around corners.I think this mouse is well constructed and will hold up for a long while.If you running windows/vista than it has two other buttons that bring up the game file and macro changing, useful but not really must have feature.All in all a confident and very good gaming mouse.

I have been an avid Norton Symantec user for over 13 years.  This is the worst product EVER. It slows your system down so much that I had to disable most of the features, which an average user will not know how to do.  My biggest complaint is that once the "virus update" expires.. it renders the entire software useless. I couldn't even go in and make simple changes to the settings, nothing to do with the virus update feature. PLUS  A pop-up comes up everyday twice a day begging me to buy another year subscription. That is false. What they are really asking is that I buy the software again. Once a year is up .. you might as well throw it in the trash OR give it to someone else OR wipe your hard drive and install a fresh copy. I am not happy with it at all! I will never buy any anti-virus or internet security software from this company again.  I have heard of complaints that it will crash your system the day it expires. Uninstalling any Norton products are difficult and you should find a good article on the internet on how to do this.  NOTE: You must uninstall any anti-virus software if you are installing a different brand.

I saw so much potential for an amazing story...but I was disappointed on so many levels.  There were parts of this book that showed such promise.  Bella's change, the coming of the Volturi, the introduction of the new vampires (some of them were interesting or really had the chance to be).  Somewhere along the way, this book just lost itself. I am all for happy endings, in fact I crave them.  But just like in real life, I know that to get to the happy ending, there are struggles.  Bella didn't have to really face any.  She is perfect, everything goes her way, she has none of the struggles that anyone else went through in becoming a vamp, adjusting to life, battling the evil.  Just nothing.  I'm actually struggling to leave this review.  I think so many people before me covered what was wrong with this novel.  The vampire baby, the gruesome way the child came into this world, and then.....just as you thought there would be complications having this child....BAM!  The baby is perfect.  Just like Bella. I can't even find the words to describe how saddened I was.  When parts of the book had potential to be amazing, they just floundered. When the storyline actually got interesting, banality took over and everything worked out just perfect in Bella's perfect life with her perfect husband and perfect baby.I'm not going to go into all the spoiler's, there is no reason to as many people have stated them in a better way than I can at this point.  I will just say that I feel sorry for Stephenie Meyer.  She dropped the ball.  She had the universe, she had the characters, she had everything to make this an interesting read.  Instead she turned it into a travesty of itself and the series.  Yes, the series was fluff and a total guilty pleasure kind of thing, but for some reason, I expected more.  Not this muddled mix of too many ideas that never really meld.  You do get a happy ending, but at what cost?  No cost to Bella....only to the quality of the book and to what could have been an amazing story.

I charged it fully and installed the software before attempting to use.  When I plugged it in to the PC upon prompting from the install software, it briefly brought up a screen asking to update firmware or clear the memory.  However, it was frozen on that screen.  The screen then went black and now I  can't turn it on at all, whether or not it's plugged into the pc.  Seems like it would be nice if it worked.

"DICTATE" by MacSpeech is a tragedy!    It's a tragedy for the normal user, but even moreso for the neurologically handicapped patients to whom it offered the opportunity to communicate more normally. If you were to bundle the potentially best voice dictation application for Mac that's on the market (and probably the best on the horizon) with one of the worst customer service group you can imagine, and heat that mix with the total absence of documentation on the disc or third-party, you'd know why so many reviewers are complaining that they've been defrauded.      It's hard to assign some number of stars to an application with which you're having such a love/hate relationship.   Imagine buying Mac OSX Leopard or Microsoft Office with a technical support group that knows even less than you do and no users' manuals.  That'd give you a great OS or application, but it would take weeks to discover and implement one small fraction of what it's designed to do.     That is why I'd put off buying DICTATE by MacSpeech until they have a product to sell.  Then, I'd rush to buy it.

I bought my first set of fleece sheets last year and so loved them I had to have more. Searching the internet, I found these sheets at a great price. I ordered 2 sets and just loved the chestnut color. My disapointment came 2 days after I washed them and put them on my bed. They would not stay on. The elestic at the corners was very poorly done. I kept putting them back on the bed daily. They were soft and a nice thickness. So I am back on the internet looking for a better set. I think i will order only 1 set this time.

I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.  Bottom line, Intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market.  I for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there.

If you want a do-it-all package that is very portable, then get this machine. It is a must.I bought this machine because I needed a new laptop and wanted something that was very portable. I opted for the 10" screen and the 6 cell battery because of recommendations from other reviews. I am not regretting the choices.This thing is fabulous! It does everything they claim and more. The size does not get in the way, and the keyboard is hardly smaller than normal so it is very easy to use. The screen is big enough, but I must confess when I go back to my 15" Dell, I hear the theme from 2001 A Space Odyssey in my head. ;)Speed in booting is very good. Conectivity is very good too. It can automatically connect to any wifi it has been connected to in the past as it is in range. In other words, it can and does hand off to the strongest signal it can find as you move. A handy feature when you are a passenger in a car and there are lots of hotspots along the way. I bought an external antenna for use with my larger laptop and it worked well, however this mini-laptop has better ability to bring in the signals. Case in point: I am using a wifi signal that the other machine - external antenna and all - cannot even detect.As for the lack of bluetooth I use the USB device I have had for some time so no loss there over the other model. If I ever find I need wirelss N, I can get the external USB card too - so no worries.I thought I would miss a drive on this thing but so far I don't - surprisingly. Anything I need I transfer with an USB drive or download from the 'net and all is fine. (With the exception of not being able to play movies well, so far... I just need to find better playback software.)It works well with Skype and can multitask well. It is a good all-round portable machine.The SD card adapter is more convenient than I ever thought it would be. The USB ports are fast and handy as heck. I no longer have to bring a hub with me. It is virtually an all inclusive machine for me, just what I wanted, it has enough built-ins and ports to do everything I need on the go without lugging a rat's nest of add-ons.Now for the negatives;(I have to nit-pick to find any) I find it stutters a bit playing back movies recorded in AVI format. I suppose it must be the player software as my older, much slower machine plays them effortlessly. I'll post a comment if I find out what works for them. I watch Netflix movies on it daily, and that works beautifully! The idea is that I like to take DVD movies with me sometimes and without an internal DVD drive, I need to record them in digital memory to play them back on this machine. I have to find a good, smooth playing format, that won't eat-up the entire hard disk if I am going to do that. I simply hate jittery video. Also, the speakers are sometimes hard to hear with lower sound levels, but that is what headphones are for. Besides, what do you expect from tiny little speakers on a laptop? Well, these sound pretty good, just not all that loud sometimes (depending on source levels).Also, the disk drive shows two partions at 80g and 60g that does not add up to 160 so I am wondering. Nothing to be alarmed about there is plenty of space. Also, the screen is a little short: as in it has less vertical space than I would like. Too many bars on the web browser and you need to scroll down just to see anything. A minor annoyance, but I suppose one must compromise somewhere. The case (in ebony) is a fingerprint magnet. I don't mind, I just clean it a lot then. Also, the buttons on the mouse pad are a lot stiffer than any others I have ever used, but one can get used to it. As usual for me, there are too many features on the mouse pad and the keyboard: one fumble and you've done something weird. I wish I could turn off a feature or two on that mouse pad, but that's just the way I look at things. I want it to do what I am telling it rather than what it thinks I want it to do.Conclusion:All in all I can't really fault the machine. I've been using it for about a month now, every day, and it has never disappointed me. I've never been able to say that before, in my 33 years of computer use. Hence the five stars.

Having watched this movie on a plane ride, my first impression was that I really liked the movie. My second impression is that it would look nice in HD. Thankfully Marvel Studios and Paramount have delivered a great Blu Ray release w/ HD video.So the way the movie itself goes is typical super hero movie type stuff. If you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on. You won't like this movie anymore than you did the other super hero movies out there.Tony Stark, the sort of spoiled, super intelligent and conceited owner of Stark Enterprises finds himself in an impossible situation. While traveling through Iraq to show off his great new weapons the Humvee he is in is attacked and he is captured. He awakens to find that one of his captors has installed an electro magnet in his chest to prevent mobile shrapnel from the explosion Tony was caught in from reaching his heart.In captivity he's asked to build one of his top of the line missiles for his captors, a Jericho missile. Instead he builds a prototype Iron Man suit and escapes. The experience changes his life and has him attempt to change his company and the world from the destruction he and has company have profited from.Action, betrayal, small amount of clumsy love and that is Iron Man in a nut shell.The video is presented via the AVC codec and looks amazing. The only areas of "problem" would be in the cave scenes. You can tell when the film stock changes or perhaps, if it was filmed in digital, grain was added to the video. The areas most affected are darker scenes and scenes where there is interaction between the prototype Iron Man suit (done in CG) and his environment and the terrorists. It's either an artistic decision or a choice to make the CG interaction less perceptible. It doesn't take away from the scenes and it doesn't detract from the movie.The audio is done in Dolby True-HD and sounds fantastic. Lows are low and highs are high. No clipping, no distortion and great separation of channels over all.Having bought quite a few Blu Ray discs, I'm painfully aware of the lack of HD extras. Not so with Iron Man. This release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries. And yes, the documentaries are ALL in HD. This may be the first Blu Ray disc I've purchased with all HD extras.Also included is a BD Live connection. I have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing. Not sure about the BD Live extras.So if you're looking for a super hero movie with some amazing video, amazing audio and amazing extras, look no further than Iron Man on Blu Ray.FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING LONG LOAD TIMES:If you have a BD Live capable player, in the menus of your player, turn off "auto download" and set it to confirm (or something along those lines). The reason the movie takes "forever" to start when you first insert it is because the quiz portion from BD-Live needs to be downloaded and installed on your player. Just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.And once it is installed the first time, assuming you wait, you won't see it again unless you get a new player and want to watch the movie.

I purchased the 3 month package and treated our dog- a beagle/basset mix.  He's a puppy, and still within the weight guidelines.  I might as well have just smeared Crisco on his neck.  This stuff did nothing, and I mean, NOTHING for his fleas.  Our yard is treated, our house was fumigated, so I know he's not tracking more in.  The Frontline that I purchased for our cat was equally worthless.  So, I'm back to shampooing the two every week until enough time passes that I can treat them with something else.  I'm going to go with Advantage or Revolution next time.Your mileage may vary.  From the reviews on here, it looks like Frontline's really hit-or-miss with whether or not it's going to work on your dog.

Another year's worth of eye candy from Intuit, with no substantive changes.  Quicken for the Mac still doesn't know how to handle a brokerage account that lets you write checks off your cash balance (e.g., E*Trade) without forcing you to split the account into two ledgers that you have to relate manually (Quicken for Windows had this feature eight years ago!).  My financial institutions (e.g., Fidelity) that used to say "online features not compatible with Quicken for the Mac" still aren't compatible with Quicken for the Mac.  And it still refuses to remember where on the screen I left my windows.  Meanwhile, the changes they do make are fluff.  I've always been able to schedule bills and payments in Quicken, why would I even want to involve iCal now?  If it weren't for Intuit's practice of arbitrarily discontinuing all online connectivity for old versions of Quicken when they reach a certain age, I'd never upgrade at all.  I haven't seen anything actually USEFUL in a Quicken Upgrade in the past five years.

I don't dislike the battery as such.  It's just that I bought it because Amazon says customers often buy it with Innotek pet collars.  The battery doesn't fit these collars, and Amazon should not let this pairing mislead people like me.  The Petsafe battery is a disk you screw in; the Innotak collars take a conventional cylindrical battery.  I wrote to customer support about the matter, but received an automated reply that didn't resolve it.  I note the PetSafe battery is still being paired with the Innotek collars.

I recently purchased a Kitchenaid Accolade Mixer for my well deserving mother-in-law for Christmas.  After spending the large amount of money I waited patiently to receive the mixer in the mail.  I was surprised to come home and find the mixer, in it's manufactured box, sitting on my front steps.  I was very surprised to see that the mixer was not placed inside another box as if to "hide" it's contents to others. On Christmas my mother-in-law opened the gift to find several large gouges (cuts) on the body of the mixer, and several scratches and dents on the stainless steel bowl of the mixer.  Needless to say, for the amount of money I spent on the mixer and shipping costs, I would like to think that the product is going to be in "mint" condition.  Now I have to return the mixer and wait a longer period of time to get a new one.  Next time I will be sure to shop in a store so that I have the opportunity to inspect any possible damages.

A lot of people liked this movie, but jeez, I gotta say I found it hard to get into and hard to believe in and I'm a Woody Allen fan, have been for a long time. But that scene with Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall in that restaurant in Barcelona when Javier Bardem saunters up to their table and says he wants to fly them off on his private plane and make love to both of them at the same time, come on!These girls are American Hotties and they ain't a going anywhere with any dude short of Mick Jagger with a line like that. A girl as hot as these, probably Mick would have a problem, he is getting a bit long in the tooth, after all. But these girls, they go, that would never ever happen. Then having Scarlett move in with the Javier character and wind up not only having an affair with him, but with Penelope Cruz, the ex-wife,  as well -- well, well, well, a gentleman's fancy but not real.And after only one night out in the grass, shagging with Javier and the Rebecca Hall character is madly, ever so madly in love, but she says nothing so that her best bud Scarlett can keep a-going with her threesomes. Madly in love with the Javier character, but marries the dud fiancee anyway.Oh, Woody, What Were You Thinking? It's hard to believe this was made by the same man who gave us Annie Hall.

I've been a heavy Office 2004 Excel user for the past two+ years.  I was severely disappointed when I installed Office 2008.  Microsoft elected to omit functionality that is core to being productive in Excel - solver support, data analysis, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and more.  If you rely on Excel to do any type of business analysis or are a student that will require access to data analysis tools (regression, histograms, distributions, etc.), you will be SOL with 2008.  I highly recommend that you avoid Office 2008.Office 2008 is so incomplete and unsuited for professional work that it prompted me to write this review, which is my first.

Ice cream maker was bought as an X-Mas gift and was probably the best one to give.  It is not too expensive and has been used numerous times to create delicious ice creams.  It is also very easy to use, no more ice cubes and salt like many older machines, it is all self-contained.  I would recommend looking up other ice cream recipes online to make healthier alternatives because the accompanying booklet calls for whole milk and cream mostly...

This book is mostly about fast foods and fast food restaurants.  It says eat this fast food not that fast food.I was hoping for a book that spoke to substitution for real foods.  I wanted something that said substitute this real food for something similar that is less fattening.  What it doesn't say is things like: don't eat butter when there are wonderful jams that have no sugar and are just 10 calories a spoonful.  It also doesn't say things like: don't make your dip from sour creme use yogurt instead because yogurt tastes just the same as sour creme in a dip and is less fattening.  I never eat in McDonald's and those other places because everything sold there is very, very, very fattening regardless of any substitution you can make there.I am disappointed with this book.  It is just an exploration of fattening fast foods.  I had hoped for something with more substance.

This is the second one of these I've had the (dis)pleasure of working with. Fortunately I only bought the first one... 1) Wireless stops working 1-2 times a week. Sometimes power cycling works, sometimes resetting from scratch works. Sometimes neither works. However it might be overheating... I just put it in the freezer since I noticed it was warm and its back working... When you ping the router when it starts misbehaving it times out or gets responses like 768ms. Plugging directly into the router when it acts like this works, but what's the point?2) Internet access is consistently slower than everywhere else and we have cable.  I have installed the latest BIOS update for this thing. My roomates get feisty when they cant get on the internet and I am an IT professional.. hehehe. They are starting to doubt my skills!At this rate Im thinking of going back to dialup.  I got a spare 1200 baud modem floating around here...

I had one of these for five years and had no problems; made great coffee with no mess.  I just replaced it and am now on my third one in three weeks due to overflow from the basket.  I put only half of the max. amount of grounds in and am still having the grounds back up to the top of the paper filter and into the spray mechanism.  Have tried everything Cuisinart recommends:  Different filters, different grind of coffee, different carafe placement, charcoal filter in, charcoal filter out, etc.  No luck so far---never had this problem with my old one (exact same model).  Otherwise love the coffeemaker, but am about to give up and just return it for another brand.  Has anyone solved this?

I bought this the other day along with a D-Link DSL-2320B modem.  The router works beautifully.  Easy to set up and very good signal strength.  The D-Link modem didn't work out and D-Link Tech Support wasn't very good at resolving the issue so I had to take that back.  I connected another modem to the router though and it works great.  I haven't bought a media streamer yet so don't know how that will work but suspect it will do just fine based on what I've seen the DIR-655 do so far.

It should be said, first and foremost, that this movie is brilliant. I really think, between this movie and "Batman Begins" that Chris Nolan has set a new standard for comic-book based movies. He's proven its possible to take them and make them accessible to people without being campy, to include real emotions, even drama, believable and entertaining action sequences, all in a story that is handled seriously. That said, all the performances in this movie are anywhere between great and brilliant, no complaints.Now where this disc goes wrong is its rather intolerable switching between 16:9 and letterbox (2.4:1) format. The creators of the disc clearly wanted to showcase their occasional use of i-max film, but they must have neglected to realize that not all of us have a 100 foot wall onto which to project these pristine images. The result is that you get sequences where Batman jumps off a tower in Hong Kong in 16:9 (full screen for modern televisions) and the people wandering around in the building 2 seconds later are in letterbox, you see him flying around and crashing through the window in full screen, and then he rolls to a halt in letterbox. This is actually a simplified explanation of what actually happens, because there are actually 3 or 4 more switches back and forth in that one action sequence. Needless to say, it is quite distracting. Its completely bizarre that whey chose to do this, really. I'm sure they were thinking its a good idea, but everyone I've shown it to is not impressed.Your options? You can live with this, because its not an option to change it. You can buy the DVD which isn't like this, though it is clearly not the same resolution. You can wait until Warner Bros releases another version, which may never happen. What is clear is for the moment you won't be enjoying this movie to the extent you should in HD at this point.

For years friends have been urging me to get rid of the old-fashioned on the stove kettles and get a kettle that can be plugged in. I contemplated those japanese kinds with the plastic push pumps. After seeing this Breville at a friend's house I had to try it although the price point was more than I wanted to spend at the time. For this product, you get what you are paying for!All the reviewers here were so helpful in making my decision. The best features of this product:-  water heats up extremely fast-  ergonomic designed handles with comfortable rubber and easy-to-pull plug (with a hole in the middle so you don't have to yank it out of the wall, genius)-  functional design. when you turn on the kettle a pretty blue light comes on to indicate the power is on. when the water reaches temperature a bell dings to alert you. the stainless steel looks great on the counter and we use it now during the winter no less than 6 times a day. It's perfect.Other thoughts:-  metal was very important to us, didn't want any questionable plastic flavors in our tea or water-  I also ready some reviews which complained the outside of the kettle got too hot. Guess what? Use some common sense it's a hot water kettle, don't touch the outside of at any point and you'll be fine.

I have two long-haired cats, and within a week the pump was completely clogged. The little grate that keeps hair out of the pump is almost useless. Taking it completely apart and cleaning did restore flow for a bit, but now, after a couple of months, even that doesn't work anymore. The 'waterfall' has slowed to a trickle, and I suspect the pump is just about dead. Also, the bottle only holds a day or so of water, so for longer trips, I have to break out my old gravity-feed bottle anyway.

This book is not what I expected.   Most of the meals take TIME to cook, and TIME to shop for multiple ingredients, which is great if you don't have a full-time job and driver duty for after-school activities.   Almost nothing can be prepped ahead of time.   Most dishes have at least one expensive ingredient, or use only part of a package (what do you do with the rest?).  Many dishes have seasonings or flavor combinations that a young child won't tolerate (at least mine won't!).  This cookbook is better titled "The Biggest Loser Family Gourmet Cookbook."

I have an immune disorder that causes problems with periodontal disease. My dentist recommended that I purchase the Sonicare Toothbrush with the UV sanitizer. I had an older version of the Sonicare Toothbrush years ago, and this new version is vastly superior. I love the slimmer profile and the UV sanitizer. The new brushing modes make it virtually impossible to brush your teeth wrong. I love the way my mouth and teeth feel after using this toothbrush. It truly is "a just from the dentist clean". If this continues to perform the way it has so far I will be very happy. It is a little costly on the price, but definitely cheaper than major dental work. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants a whiter smile and healthier teeth.

I've enjoyed using this recorder, but I've run into a problem you need to be aware of.  I taped a 4 minute video recently, with the intent to use the enclosed software to convert it for email and send it to family.  The software would not convert the video.  And after many seemingly "canned" responses from tech support that didn't address the problem, I was finally told that 4 minutes was too long to convert and that I should make my videos shorter.  WHAT??So please be aware that you had better not plan on making a vid more than a couple of minutes long if you want to send it to youtube or by email - the software won't convert it.  And tech support was very unhelpful.

I was very disappointed with this film. Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book "Poor Fellow My Country" (and hi earlier "Capricornia"), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than  portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of "Poor Fellow My Country" was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.So, watch "Australia" for the scenery, for the cinematography, for some false nostalgia, a spot of romance, and some feel-good stuff, but don't mistake it for any kind of reality, past or present.

Five members of the family read this book (including four middle school/high school members) and overall it receives an average 2 rating (the first three all were ranked 5 stars). Honestly, as one reviewer already said, it felt like someone completely different wrote this book.  I think that the more mature viewpoint of Edward and Bella (and baby), might have made more sense if a fourth book had transitioned their story (and Jacob's involvement in the triangle)to a fifth.  Additionally, the conflict with the other vampires, which had been more of a subplot before, needed another book to transition to the major plot.  Essentially, the first three books were fantasy/romance novels; this one read more like a fantasy/action adventure with a romance undertone.  Jacob is the only character that seemed consistent with the past for most of the book (though his personality was a bit watered-down with the imprint issue) and the change in Bella's father was a major disappointment. At the end, we all found ourselves longing for a less "happily-ever-after" and a more "realistically-ever-after" ending.

I purchased this gate because it was wide enough to fit at the bottom of our stairs with the two extensions.  The problem was the space had enough difference between the top and bottom of the gate that it was too big with two extensions, but too small with one.  I ended up having to cut the bottom of both extensions for it to work properly.Thankfully I did not buy the gate for the auto close feature, because it needs to be perfectly aligned for that feature to work completely.All and all I do feel it's a very good gate for the price.

Pros: Elegant styling, decent build quality, easy to use, carafe stays cool outside which is safer with little ones probing hands aroundCons: Coffee flavor harsh and coffee temp too low even at brew time, much less any time laterI bought this after seeing the largely positive reviews, and now regret it.  Coming from a Krups (10 year old model) to this was a massive let down.  The coffee in the pot and during brewing is 15*F and 10*F colder respectively than my old Krups (measured with probe) and both taste and ability to add cream (and still have decently hot coffee) suffer.  This is before even considering the carafe, which doesn't do a creditable job of keeping the coffee warm if not preheated or not full (or both).  If you're looking for a machine to make full pots on demand, and can handle the somewhat harsh taste of the coffee, by all means this is the machine for you. Other than these sore spots, it is excellent (but what use is bad coffee?).  If you prefer a smoother, richer cup of coffee and wish to use the timer to make a half carafe or so in the morning, cross this one off your list right now. Run, don't walk.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

If your highest priority is interoperability with documents produced by various  versions of MS office or you want a Mac application with some level of Exchange server compatibility, or you need one or more of the features only found in this product then this product may be for you.Otherwise you are far better served with other Office applications like OpenOffice or iWork.As usual, MS has produced a bloated, slow, leaky, buggy suite that features frequent crashes and frequent large and temperamental updates.  The interface is neither fully Mac like (nor does this operate like most mac programs in many ways), and neither is it fully PC or Office 2007 like.  If installing a new version beware that the MS supplied uninstall does not completely uninstall a previous version and you won't be able to use a new product key without cleaning up some preference files Office squirrels away.  The SP1 update is also a real treat, popping up an error message window behind the install window that makes it look like the install froze.  More of the same from MS.Since its only redeeming features are MS Office compatibility, a unique (large) feature set, and some level of Exchange server compatibility, there is really no point to this version since you would be just as well served by the Standard version of Office 2008.  There are many other programs that do a far better job on the Mac than  the "Expression Media" materials that distinguish this version from the Standard version.

Right now, it only works as a very light doorstop.  This is the first linksys problem i've had any problems with.

I have used many linksys wireless routers, and this linksys router is very average.  If speed is your thing, this router is DEFINITELY not for you.  if you need a big range, this router will disappoint you.  I live in a 2500 sq ft house and this router will not deliver good signal throughout the house.  This router will be good for about a few weeks, but later on, you will probably need to reset it every so often because your wireless connection will be dropped.  If you are looking for a good reliable router for your house, I would suggest the D-Link DIR-655.  If you want a regular router for a medium size apartment and you don't play a lot of games or downloads, this router will fit your most basic needs, nothing more.

I have the Magic Bullet and I read some less than good reviews on the unit. I would like to put those to rest if I may. 1. After using the magic bullet, could smell the motor burning up.   Having worked with motors in the past, I can put that bad rap to rest. There are two types of electrical motors commonly used in the market today. One is an induction motor. and the other is the brush and commentator motor. Although the induction motor is most commonly used, there are some brush types out there. The burning electrical smell you sensed is common, especially when first using the motor. When first used, the brushes are not worn slightly to perfectly fit against the commentator. Until that happens, the brushes will slightly arc and you will sense an electrical smell but it doesn't take long till they are perfectly fitted to the commentator. After that, the smell will no longer be there. This is normal and is not a problem. It is not a sign of overheating or any damage to the motor.   2. I found an excellent quick way to clean the Bullet. I first spray the blade and inside of the cup to remove larger particles, then I fill the cup about 1/3 full with water and just a drop of soap detergent. Screw the blade lid on firmly and pulse it a few times. Unscrew and rinse and you will have a sparkling clean unit. This will get into areas that otherwise you couldn't possibly reach especially in and around the blade area.  3. I have also found that removing the processed food from the cup is best done with a small rubber spatula as use of a metal object like a knife or fork etc will eventually scratch and mar the plastic. 4. My Magic Bullet came with several replacement rubber gaskets that are used inside the black blade screw on caps. When you have cleaned your unit and you are going to store with blade cap screwed onto the food cup, do not screw the blade cap tightly with the food cup as when it is stored even overnite, the rubber gasket will tend to flatten out and then need replacement.I always leave mine about a turn loose and you will get a lot more use out the gaskets.5. When I am making a sandwich spread or anything requiring mayo I wait until I have finished processing the food and then I mix the processed food and mayo in a separate bowl. If you add the mayo before processing, the mayo and the fool is going to stick to the sides and even tapping is not going to loosen it. 6. The instruction book says that you need to occasionally tap the blade/cup unit to free up food to get to the blade. I have personally found that a back and forth shaking motion does a much better job as all the food in usually at the bottom anyway and a few shakes will move it into the blades and wa-la, it works mucho bettro. 7. If you read the instructions and use accordingly, you will find the magic bullet works, (Maybe not excatly like on TV) but I am very pleased with mine. I have also fould that the shorter   pulses seem to work best as they don't tend to sling the food out and away from the blade. 8. I tried processing some pecans, mixed a little soy milk and honey and created some great tasting health food.If you are considering the Magic Bullet, I can just say that it is like anything else, when directions are followed, it will work fine. When I picked up the Base unit, the weight tells me that the motor is plenty big enough to get the job done. A light motor, light duty, a heavy motor, heavy  duty. Enjoy  Thanks for your time,Darryl K Springston

I just got this dreamsie for my 3 and half months old baby. He is 18 lbs and 26 inches. He's a big baby and I hope he doesn't outgrow this dreamsie in a month or two. I like that once I put him in it for the night, he seems to sleep so much better. He used to kick the blanket off him, then it got too cold for him and he would cry out for us. Now he's not able to do that no more. He's warm and in "deep sleep" with it. I like the fact that there is no way my baby can wiggle the dreamsie onto his face. I now have a better sleep myself too by knowing he won't be cold in the night no more. No more getting up in the middle of the night to check on him. I love the dreamsie!

I love the fact that it comes set up and ready to go with all the software you need (and lots more). I love the fact that this particular model comes with a spacious solid-state drive! No hard drive to fail at the most inopportune moment, yah! So, it is what it is, but what it is is perfect for me.

Why is it that Intuit offers every configuration except the one most people want?  Federal+State+eFile Probally because they found out how to make more money.  Forget about calling, they don't have support.

I got the Panasonic SD-YD250 as a Christmas present, and have been very happy with it! I've read the other reviews on here about bread makers in general, and some people get a perfect loaf every time, and others don't have any luck at all. I think the trick is that you need to **weigh** the flour - 8 ounzes of flour is NOT a cup of flour! It must be weighed, so the ingredient list shows dry ounzes and wet ounzes which means it must be weighed. If you use a measuring cup for the flour - it will be the wrong amount and will not come out correctly! Another item it to be sure you use good &quot;bread maker&quot; flour, and room temperature water. The store even carries bread ingredients &quot;in the box&quot; where all you have to do is add the ingredients out of the box into the breadmaker and some water and it also turned out a perfect loaf! I used the &quot;honey wheat berry&quot; in the box, and it had a few too many large wheat seeds, but the bread turned out perfect. Use the &quot;light&quot; crust setting, since the crust can be a little too thick &amp; chewy if use the medium(which is good for italian bread though). My favorite recipe in the recipe book is the &quot;egg bread&quot;, which uses real milk and 2 eggs(gives it a great flavor). The XL size of this unit makes a huge loaf and it rises so high that it almost touches the top of the unit! So I'm not sure what others meant by the bread not rising. I highly recommend this unit and you'll be making perfect hot fresh bread in no-time because it's so easy!

I was hoping for a wonderful netbook. Ordered it on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. Shipping was good..no damaged box. Packed well. Looks nice. 5800 battery instead of smaller one that is supposed to be with it. Problem is I cannot use it. The mouse does not work. I installed the battery and turned it on. I installed my 3-G air card. It needed to re-boot and that was the end of the mouse/trackpad. It no longer works. Instruction booklet was no help. I tried Fn + F7, but it still will not work. I hope I don't have to send it back. If I get it working, I will redo this review, but in the meantime......POOR rating from me.

I so wish I could have given this 5 stars. I recently lost my previous Sony Camcorder [Model DVD92--also mini dvd recordable] and I loved it. I never expected this 610 one to suck so hard.In general, what's great about Sony's dvd camcorders is that they really are easy to use and take great family videos. I agree with all the reviews that praise the user friendly just pick-it-up and use it accolades. This review really has to do with what you do with that content and how IMHO the newer model is not an improvement over the older one.The 610 Sucks because:-Finalizing a mini dvd on my old one took 30 seconds, this one 7 min! [WTF?!?]-On the mac, in order to edit the content you need to first rip the dvd with a program like handbrake and then hope imovie imports it with the chapters. A long and tedious process. I was told that the usb port could import the movie content on this 610 model directly-not true!-it shows up as a finalized disc, not a hard drive that you can drag/drop from. -The screen on my old one was actually better, this one has a lot of glare.-I could flip the screen so my toddler could see herself on the DVD92 while I looked thru the viewfinder. On this one it does not seem you can use the viewfinder and screen at the same time.Hope this helps! I am returning this one and trying the Sanyo xacti 1000.

Many people have commented on the typing and other features. I leave you to read those reviews for such information. I am here to write only about the touchpad not working.I ordered one keyboard from Amazon and was quite happy with it upon arrival. However, the touchpad didn't work on any of my various computers (3 computers - 1 XP, 1 XP64, and 1 OSX).Razer customer support was fairly helpful and only a little slow to provide an RMA. However, I chose instead to try again via Amazon. I requested a replacement and sent the first keyboard back to Amazon.The second keyboard had the same flaw - the touchpad didn't function. I looked around even more on the internet and found this site:http://www.artage.de/2008/03/10/razer-lycosa-problems-and-how-to-fix-them/which led me to discover WHY the touchpad didn't work - a screw was hampering a circuit board connection. This problem is fairly common and even after removing the screw I had no working touchpad. I took the circuit board home and tested it - alas! It had shorted out. So the bad design (silly misplaced screw) apparently leads to a possible short on many keyboards. As a result the touchpad was not ever going to work on a number of these keyboards.I returned the second keyboard and bought a Tarantula from Amazon instead. The typing is actually nicer on the Tarantula and is on-par with my Logitech diNovo which is a pleasant surprise. I'll review this keyboard later if I find no obvious flaws.

The machine works fine.If you buy the firewire cable (e.g., Sony VMC-IL4615 1.5 Meter i.LINK 4-Pin to 6-Pin Digital Video Transfer Cable) you can actually download the movies to a computer (as another reviewer pointed out). On the mac it works well easily and basically flawlessly (sometimes the rewind hangs on you, but it might be the OS X I have on that machine).Image quality is OK, I guess. You have to realize that I am  an obsessed still photographer, so I will always complain for the image quality of a CAM recorder. It needs care when shooting at maximal focal lenght because it is so small that it is easy to make "sea-sick" productions.I previously ownen a JVC which I hated with all my heart. This one is great.I would definitely buy it again. If I had more money, I would buy the more expensive version of the same camera.

No need to repeat what's been said over and over again -- but even for a "fantasy" book, this one was over the line.  ***SPOILERS***There is no great happy ending without sacrifice.  Except in this book, apparently.  The author spent a good deal of time creating a world whose rules she felt she could break.  The author spent a lot of time making readers think that Bella would have a hard choice and/or a big sacrifice, but she didn't.  And the whole Jacob imprinting on the baby was just W.R.O.N.G.  Not the age thing... the "replacement woman is the daughter of the original woman" thing.  I gave it 2 stars because of the parts narrated by or containing Jacob (and I was Team Edward, btw).  His was pretty much the only voice that stayed true to the nature of the character.  Didn't care about Bella or Edward much at all and the rest of the crew? -- just pages of fluff.If you must read it - get it from the library.

At first I thought that this was a great product, I've had other kingston's in the past and this continued the trend.  I'm not a fan of Sandisk so I thought I'd give another retractable a try, especially since this one has such high reviews.Worked great for about 3 weeks, but then it started to slow down on transfer rates, not impressive in the first place.  I'm rough on electronics, and unfortunately the plastic didn't hold up.  On campus, people bump into computers all the time and one time was enough to break the plastic on this.  It only worked for one day after that and is now useless.So over-all I can't say I'm impressed.

I have never used Quicken before, but heard generally good review from friends and coworkers.  I used other Intuit software, like TurboTax, and have been reasonably satisfied with it.  I received an e-mail with an offer too good to pass up - Quicken 2009 Deluxe plus WillMaker Plus 2009, all for only $[...].  I was thinking about buy both any way.  Now that I played with Quicken 2009 Deluxe for several days (installed WillMaker Plus 2009, but haven't used it yet), I can see why Intuit was so eager to dump Quicken.  I hope WillMaker Plus 2009 will turn out to be worth $[...].  Quicken 2009 Deluxe really disappointed (even shocked) me with poor and unintuitive user interface which I thought was their strength.  I am a software engineering manager with 20 years of experience.  I would be embarrassed if my team produced crap like this.  Yes, I have seen worse, but it is puzzling that this product passed their usability test.  There are functional flaws as well.  Downloading transactions produces net balance that is completely out of whack with current balance.  I was hoping that it would download transactions for my mortgage account, but it does not.  Only option I see is online payment via Quicken.  I don't need that.  I have automatic payment set up.  For checking account, it shows transactions only in chronological order (oldest at the top.  most recent at the bottom).  Shockingly, there is no option to list in reverse chronological order.  I understand that the default be in chronological order to emulate physical checkbook register.  But no option to reverse the order??  That is stupid.  In many ways, it typifies their limited way of thinking in designing and implementing this product.  It just doesn't have the feel of well-thought-out software product.  Options/buttons are not where you expect to find them.  Too many bells and whistles scattered all over without coherent thinking.  They should focus on making the basics work properly, before adding bells and whistles.  Avoid this product.

Let me begin by saying: this controller bites. However, it does not suck as bad as the other Wingman Logitech mess. I keep getting these crappy controllers as presents, so I'm going to spare countless others from getting them. DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER. It has a bad feel to it, very breakable. Just because it looks like the Play Station controller, it does not respond as well. The D pad is very flimsy, in my opinion. I own this thing for one week already, and I expect it to be destroyed in a few more days. Now, I'm not a gaming guru, but I know thrash when I get it. In short, Logitech has a history for sucking. The end.

We love all of our other Cuisinart products, and were really hoping that this would be the answer to our long-standing search to find something better than the George Forman grills we had purchased in the past.  Our big beef (no pun intended) with the Forman grills was that they were so hard to clean.  We thought that the Cuisinart with the removable grills would be easier.It is easier in that when cleaning the grill you can remove them, but the "non-stick" surface is not at all the sort of quality I had hoped for and the coating is so thin that anywhere the upper grill contacts the lower grill there are already bright shiny aluminum spots showing through.  We have only used the Grill for two weeks and we are concerned that the coating will not last.  We are very careful when cleaning to use only soft brushes and Dawn dishwashing liquid, but because of this the "crusties" that become hard-cooked when grilling burgers are very hard to remove.  The provided notched cleaning tool is not much help in removing them unless it is used vigorously in repeated scrubbing back and forth; probably a result of the fact that the notches are a sloppy fit in the grill bars.We also find that if the burgers or meat are placed near the edge the run-off liquid will not be well channeled to the drain spout... a result of the grill bars being so low that they are not allowing drainage.  I like my burgers juicy, but we still want the liquid to drain rather than pooling like it does.Using this as a griddle gave "OK" results, as did using it as a panini press.  The temperature control can be confusing with three dials and you will want to study the user's guide instructions carefully before you begin this sort of use.  We are strongly considering returning this item and continuing our search for the product that delivers what this product promises, but still fails to provide.

I saved up my Pepsi points for this, and have never been so happy with a "loyalty program reward".  I got this to replace my old PNY 512MB drive.  I don't have a tonne of chunky files to carry around, but my portable FireFox profile and Thunderbird archive were filling the whole thing up with no room for much else.  I also had a few sectors go bad on the PNY, further limiting just how much storage was available to me.Knowing that I now have the Kingston name and warranty leaves me feeling much more secure.  I don't personally know anyone who has ever complained about bad sectors on a Kingston USB drive.  Moving up to the 2GB drive, I have room for all of the portable applications I need with plenty of room to spare for files.  Carrying something the size of a keychain beats the pants off of lugging my laptop bag everywhere.  I've actually uninstalled the registered versions of Firefox and Thunderbird and now run only the portable versions natively on my desktops and laptop, which makes synch'ing everything via USB drive that much faster.  As to file transfer rate, the Kingston drive also seems to complete transfers much faster than my previous drive.It's not nearly as big as some of the other options on the market now, but 2GB is plenty enough storage space for me when I'm away from home. I'm sure it's plenty enough for other folks too.  For the available storage -- it's great!

Works exactly as promised. Just plug it into the USB port and it will do the rest for you! It saves common files, which includes pretty much anything you use on a regular basis unless you are doing very specialized work. Documents, spreadsheets, email files, photos, videos, you name it. It also saves files according to which computer they came from, so if you back up more than one computer in one device, it will keep everything organized. I used to be a slacker about doing backups, but with this it just takes two seconds on your part and the device does the rest! I also like that the backup process can run very smoothly in the background while you keep using the computer, without making the computer sluggish.

I've used the ClickFree on 2 computers and it keeps track of what information is from each computer, separates it.  It downloads the entire computer in about 20 minutes if you have high speed.  On my new computer of about 6 months, it only took about 4 minutes to download everything I had on it.  This item is great.  I can now transfer all my information from one computer to another one in a flash.  Just click and do nothing more, just wait and it does everything for you.  It even updates from the last thing you downloaded, continues from where you left off and downloads only the new info.  Fantastic

As an Adams buff, I was highly skeptical this movie would be acceptable to my fellow Adams historians.  We would not now have a country without John Adams.  In spite of his mistakes (the Aliens and Seditions Act being the worst), he was an honest, ethical person whose contributions have been overshadowed by better politicians like Jefferson and Franklin. He was generations ahead of his time in his social perspectives (his staunch abolitionism and respect for women being two of them). There is no John Adams monument in Washington, DC and no picture of Adams on our everyday currency (despite non-Presidents images appearing) but at least we have McCullough's wondrous book and now this beautiful film.  Abigail Adams, no less a person than John Adams, was her husband's best friend and chief adviser.  They were equals at a time when there was little power for, as Abigail said, "women and slaves".The film completely recreates the time.  Anyone who has been to Adams' birthplace and Peacefield can attest to how accurate the depictions are of those places.  Giamatti's intelligent, intuitive performance has made  the role his.  Linney, Dillane, Morse and Wilkinson are also excellent.  The direction is adult, unflinching and honest.  And yes, it is shot a bit dark but the content more than makes up for the camera.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  The sacrifices of this good and decent human being will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.

The concepts in this book are excellent for people with little or no organization in their life.  I've always made efforts to stay on top of everything I had to do, and was hoping this book would teach me something new to put squeeze a bit more productivity and efficiency into my daily grind.Unfortunately, nothing in this book should be new to anyone who has put the slightest bit of effort into attempting to improve their productivity.Then, to make matters worse, the book rambles and repeats (and rambles and repeats, and...).  Additionally, although I'm usually a pretty quick reader, but the inordinate amount of sidebar notes in this book slowed my reading, are extremely distracting, and provide zero added benefit.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the material would be beneficial for some people despite the poor presentation.

This the third Lacie drive I bought. But this model (301302U) is really bad. I decide to return it. A: the  top and sides of the drive case were actually made of plastic-like material. In my opinion it is too soft for a disk case. The most important thing is that the plastic box is very very poor for heat dissipation. The bottom of the case, which is made of metal, is supposed to undertake the job of heat dissipation. But it does NOT work well. After few minute, the disk will be very hot. B: the disk is NOT pre-formatted and it is not ready for use at once. The introduction of this product has lied on this very important point! When you connect this drive to your computer for the first time, the drive need be formatted. There is a preloaded software "setup assistant", which should be run to format the disk. But this poor "assistant", which should be fired, does NOT work on my PC laptop. I tried on another PC, it didn't work either. This software may work on Mac, but it definitely does NOT work on my PCs. So, the statements of "the drive is pre-formatted for use across Windows and Macs, doesn't require any additional drivers, and is ready to go seconds after being removed from the box" in the introduction are totally untrue! C: the cable of the power adapter is very thin and un-shielded. It is even poorer than the power cable of my razor. I can't imagine how I could trust this product to backup my data. D: the USB cable is also of very poor quality. It is thin and short. I'm not sure whether it is shielded or not. The plug and the outlet of the USB fit very loosely. This is really not good for data transfer. I said the USB cable is short. It is even shorter than that of my mobile drive. So, it can't not be used for my big desktop at all. E: you can't imagine that the customer support is also poor. I can't find any really useful information about this product on the LaCie website. When you try to post a question, you have to register. After that, you have to wait and wait for answers. My suggestion: don't be fooled by the stunning appearance, especially the charming blue light. This is a bad drive poorly designed. And do NOT buy this model.

I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop. That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as "right-click," but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) "about a minute" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.  I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.

Nowhere in Turbo Tax's promotional material do they you say anything about their new pay-as-you-go pricing structure, which comes on top of their new software price increases. Every new return you print/file after the first one will cost you an ADDITIONAL $9.95! But they don't tell you that until AFTER you've download and installed the software.If you don't like these bait-and-switch tactics, buy TaxCut or TaxAct, which allow unlimited individual returns for no additional charge. TaxCut also allows you to transfer data from Turbo Tax 2007 returns.

Before anybody comes to the defense of Linksys, they should read some of the horror stories. My Linksys router would not function properly on either of my PCs, both produced by different manufacturers. The customer support was non-existent. In fact, attempts to contact customer support were ignored. Only after I purchased a New Gear router did I learn what reliable wireless Internet was all about.I agree with the reviewer who compared his Linksys router to ET for the Atari 2600. Pure trash. Even the design is poor. My Net Gear router is less than half the size.If you buy Linksys, be sure you know where the reset button is on their router. Also be sure you know how to reset your Internet connection. If you have a Linksys and it works, you are lucky. I assure you that if you ever had to contact their tech support, you would sing a very unhappy tune.

I have a 10-year-old Zojirushi bread maker so I was excited to get this coffee maker.  It is marketed as commercial grade so I didn't mind paying more for it.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this coffee maker because of the carafe.  It is VERY difficult to open after brewing coffee.  Definitely not for the elderly or anyone who makes coffee first thing in the morning.My other complaint is the plastic cap that goes on top of the carafe lid.  It is designed to keep the heat from escaping after brewing.  The problem is if you forget to remove it before brewing the next pot.  If you forget the coffee will end up all over your counter and floor.  It shold have been designed to prevent the carafe from fitting back under the brewer.

My dog has had the collar on for the past several days.  While he has barked numerous times, the collar has nly sprayed once.   Prior to purchasing the Premier Gentle Spray collar, I used the Multivet Deluxe collar.   I don't think it performed all that well either, but it did spray about 50% of the time when my dog barked and so it definitely worked better than the Premier one has so far.   I will say that the Premier collar has been easier to fill and turn on/off than the Multivet one.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

I had read mixed reviews about MS Office for the Mac and was reluctant to install it on my MacBook Pro.  As it turns out, my fears were unfounded.  It does have a different look than the Windows version and takes a little getting used to .  I am pleasantly surprised with the speed of the applications as I had read that it was a bit sluggish.  Not the case at all.  It is very zippy and the few docs and spreadsheets that I've experimented with have migrated back and forth between my Mac and PC with no problems, so far.    I'm not sure that it is worth buying, however, if you already have IWorks on your Mac, since you can export all of your files to a PC from the iWork applications.  In the end, I'll probably use the Office suite for my work applications and iWork for my personal use.

Being an advid baker, it was with trepidation that I purchased a machine to make bread.  This product came so highly rated by resources I put great faith in that I decided to try it.  The end product is delicious.  It is so easy to make a loaf of warm, soft, and wonderful bread.The only issue I have is that the loaves produce slices larger that our toaster.  Also, it is smart to feel the dough during the 'add in' period to make certain that it is of the consistency for a proper rise.  I have been using this machine at least two times per week since receiving it.  My family and I are really hooked.  I love my Zoey.Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine

I've been through FOUR of these expensive units. They work great on my Great Pyrenees dog. At least they work for awhile. Then I end up trying to figure out if the batteries are dead, then if the NEW batteries I put in were dead to begin with, and then I send it back for repair. Once I got back a unit that worked again - for awhile. Then I got back a unit that never worked again.I stopped sending in my broken units after that.So - in desperation, and impending poverty, I switched to a shock collar; it was either that or what my breeder calls a "blue juice special". It also worked - and yes, I tried it on myself and decided that it wasn't cruel at all. But the punchline is this: the shock collars broke at about the same rate as the citronella collar. At least they were cheaper, so I didn't lose as much money.

I am very impressed with the Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router. I am no networking guru, yet I was able to set this router up in a pretty straightforward manner, with almost none of the complications I expected. I used to enjoy experimenting with networks when I was younger, so its nice to know I have the options this router allows, but to tell you the truth, I'm so satisfied with what came in the box that I probably won't be changing it any time soon -- in fact I bought another for my parents, who were having a terrible time with the wireless router they rented from their ISP (They are very happy with this router as well.)The signal is strong enough to pick up a hundred feet away, through at least one wall. The encryption package offers several options, including WPA 2. I have had one failure that occurred while I was setting the router up, all I had to do was unplug it for ten seconds to reset, and it has worked perfectly ever since. The directions are very good, clearly written and comprehensive (including security precautions.)The last thing I love about this router is the additional options allowed by the ethernet ports on the back -- all the old computers (including an Apple IIe) came out of the garage and are now connected  to the internet, and to each other. This is a fabulous product right out of the box, I can't imagine what can be done with it by people who really know what they are doing. I am very satisfied with this purchase.

On July 9th of 2008 I purchased this unit primarily due to such outstanding reviews I found on Amazon.  For the first month I was as happy as all the five star reviewers.  I really loved the unit.  Last week the unit stopped exporting my walking details to the software (which is the feature that I liked most).After calling Omron, they recommended that I take the sofware off my computer and attempt to put it back on.  And that if that didn't work, the problem most likely came from a default in the unit.  Putting on the new software didn't fix the issue, so I called Omron back and told them that I must have a faulty unit.  They told me that I had to send back the unit to their repair department and include a $5.00 money order for the expense of sending me back a new unit.  So they are asking me to pay for both shipping, to and fro, to replace a unit I purchased one month ago.  That is an insult to injury.  Not only do they not acknowledge the down time of not having the unit, the inconvenience and time spent mailing the unit and going to the bank to get a money order, but they charge me $10.00 for postage.That is bad customer service in my book!

I have a 1 year old Shar Pei who HAD chronic yeast infections due to his small ear canals.  He would shake his head constantly.  I tried everything I could find, but I refused to go to the vet where they would prescribe some over-priced solution that would not treat the problem.  I started to search all over the internet for something that would work.  The famous home-remedy of boric acid seemed to work, but it took a lot longer to become effective.  I finally found ZYMOX and knew I had nothing to lose.  When it arrived my dog's ears were smelly, his ear canals were swollen and red, and he was contastaly shaking his head.  After one day (2 treatments/day) his behavior completely changed.  He was more comfortable for sure.  It took a few more days before the real results became noticable.  The amount of brown gooey material that was coming out of his ears was amazing!  ZYMOX was loosening up and allowing the mess to slowly make it's way out of his ears when he shook his head.  Honestly, it took about 14 days of repeat treatments (1 per day after the first week) to really get rid of the infection.  But, it worked!  and more importantly, I only have to treat his ears once every two weeks or so just to keep any infection from becoming a problem.  I have ordered two more bottle to keep on hand just in case.  My Shar Pei's ear canals are now a nice pale pink color, completely clean, not smelly, and he is finally happy.....  I wonder why Vet's don't recommend this product when you tell them you dog's problems?  They are quick to recommend expensive antibiotic solutions that don't treat YEAST INFECTIONS!  Thanks ZYMOX!

The D-Link Hub H-7 is NOT compatible with the USB 2 Sandisk Cardreader. I bought the hub specifically to free up a USB 2 port on my CPU that I was using for the card reader. It took about an hour to straighten out the mess created by these two pieces of equipment.This peripheral failed once again this morning. It was necessary to unplug and replug a USB 2 device in order to get it to work. The reviewer above is correct about power through-put. I cannot use it for my card reader which requires power or to recharge my iPod. I still have my old USB 1 hub. I won't toss it now. It may go back on line.I'm also very suspicious of the authors of many of the rave reviews. Can they be D-Link distributor employees?My comments are not suitable for this site. Sufficed to say - beware of the D-Link Hub. It doesn't work with everything. Returning the D-Link is more hassle than it's worth, I'll just toss it if it continues to fail, so the sale stands though the customer is not happy.

Exterior box and breadmaker package in perfect condition and sealed. When opened, the front was dented, the word Breadman was scatched and smeared and there were fingerprints on lid (underneath a loose plastic bag to make it appear new). Never had a bad experience like this with Amazon. Since this was purchased from our bridal registry, and had no paperwork inside, it seems there is nothing we can do. I don't even want to use it or have it on the counter because all I see is a glaring dent in the front center.

What a mess! I've used Turbo Tax for 10 years+. I never really thought that it was a great product - but at least it worked and saved me a little time. This year - the install hung up saying it could not access my C drive. It attempted to back itself out of the install but then completely hung up my PC and I had to reboot. I tried to reinstall but it said that it was already installed. There was no "uninstall" procedure so I used Windows to remove the program. But it retained some footprint that still kept me from reinstalling.I sent Intuit my problem. An offshore support person sent me a boilerplate response back - telling me to try all of the things that any person with basic computer knowledge would have already tried.I short - I cannot go forward and I cannot go backwards with the installation - and Intuit's help is nonexistent. I am returning the product to Amazon. I had tried Tax Cut several years ago and found it pretty lame. Guess I'll try it again. After that? Back to my Excel spreadsheets I guess!

Electronically, this drive worked as promised and the price was competitive, but the mating of the plastic shell and the metal blade of the actual USB connector is poor. The brittle plastic cracked easily and early, not enduring anything less than ideal conditions. Given that USB ports are often in locations involving blind reaching to the back of computers, PCs are on the floor, and ports are often on the sides and backs of laptops with little room for clearance, I recommend selecting a USB drive made of sterner stuff.

It's fun for the first sixty minutes. It's goofy, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and I actually found myself enjoying it.Then it's like Michael Bay comes back from his coffee break and goes, "WTF BITCH GTFO THIS IS MY MOVIE >:(" and uses the remaining eighty minutes to make up for lost time.Yes. The world's longest Hasbro commercial is two hours and twenty minutes long. Really.Anyway, at that point, the already flimsy plot is thrown out the window, all character development ceases, and it turns into a movie about explosions and trying to make absurd computer graphics look good by moving the camera too fast for your eyes to focus. So you've got eighty minutes of tedious, blurry, pretty much non-stop combat that pauses just long enough for the plot to be sort of revived and resolved in the last five minutes of the movie.This movie taught me that computer graphics artists, as a rule, try to compensate for the shiny, too-perfect fakeness by making their work too complex for the viewer to discern detail.So "Transformers" gets five epic monologues out of ten.I miss James Cameron.

With three cats in my arsenal of cats this box works best for me. I have tried all kinds of boxes even the expensive motor driven kind. This works best. just roll and empty. One of my cats likes to pee on the inside wall of the box which killed the Littermaid, and hampered cleaning with the various other boxes I've owned. This box deals with it better because it is a MANUAL operated box. The cats cannot physically pee on the grate that seperates the clumps from the clean litter. Just roll it over daily and empty the container. Nothing is perfect, but this comes close. A bargain compared to the Littermaid and other "high-tech" boxes in terms of cost and maintenance.  Finally someone applied physics to a cat box. Give that person a raise!

Eclipse, the third book in Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series, finally solidifies the distinctly dangerous message that obsessive love is a thing divine.  By the end of the 600-page tome Bella Swan realizes that her inexplicable love for vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen is neither healthy nor rational, but she decides she simply can't live without it.  Meyer uses Emily Bronte's classic novel Wuthering Heights to justify her distasteful romance - Bella is Cathy Earnshaw, madly in love with wild and monstrous Heathcliff (not quite a vampire, but close!).  Bella and Edward quote dialogue from the novel to each other, obsessive lines spoken by deranged fictional lovers whose relationship leads to nothing but disaster for both of them.  Bronte kills off her heroine mid-way through Wuthering Heights, leaving Heathcliff alone to torment the remaining characters in his insane quest for vengeance.  By the end of the novel Bronte gives us a second generation of characters, Catherine Linton and Hareton Earnshaw, who are able to love each other realistically and thus achieve real happiness.  There is nothing noble or admirable about Cathy and Heathcliff, and there is little noble or admirable about Bella and Edward.In Eclipse, Bella is "torn between two lovers" - vampire Edward and werewolf Jacob.  Of the two, Jacob is portrayed as the flesh-and-blood man who can offer Bella a real life, even if he is a werewolf. It's clear that had magic and monsters not been part of Bella's life, she would have been with Jacob - they are, as she herself agrees, "soul mates."  In fact, she admits that the only force that could trump a soul mate is "something so strong that it could not exist in a rational world." As Jacob says to Bella, "[Edward's] like a drug for you."  And it's absolutely true - Bella is addicted and there's nothing healthy, rational, or sane about it.  There's also something very unsettling about the hoards of young women who are finding themselves as addicted to these novels (and to Bella's romance with Edward) as Bella is herself.  This is NOT love!  It's a psychotic addiction.I enjoyed Twilight and I liked parts of New Moon.  But I had a really, really hard time getting through Eclipse, mainly because I saw little growth in Bella's character and no real deepening of her incomprehensible relationship with Edward.  Meyer's message - that the ultimate love relationship defies reason and common sense - is dangerous, especially in books aimed at teenage girls.

I bought got the HV30 on Amazon about a week ago and the camera was exactly what I hoped for. When I first shot in HD I never thought it would turn out the way it did. Its INCREDIBLE.  I play xbox regulary in HD and have a lot of knowledge when it comes to picture quality and all I have to say is holy $#it. Amazing. Its easy to use and sexy looking, small sleek. The led light is cool too, nice and bright!. You dont need HD miniDV for high def, normal ones work. Be sure you have a firewire cable and a firewire port on your computer for the DV and HDV. Keep in mind there are certain programs that dont let you edit HD video, but the ones I am sure of are Sony Vegas and Pinnacle Studio. Be sure to check the system specification if you want to edit HD footage, you are gonna need a fairly buff computer.The only downside if any, and im really prying here, would be that, unlike sony, there is no nightshot, nightvison that i could find. however, it does shoot awesome inn low light and have the 24p and 30p which are stunning. so i say BUY IT

Now I have never written a review before, but after reading this...well I guess you can call it a book...I had to write something. I loved Twilight, and like New Moon, and really enjoyed Eclipse. So instead of being smart and making my own ending, I went to the bookstore at 12:01 am to get the final chapter and see how it all played out. Instead, I was handed Breaking Dawn which after the first two hundred pages, I was convinced was a joke. I kept looking for the page somewhere in there that said 'gotcha, this isn't the real thing...come back and get the actual book.' Sadly, this didn't happen. I was just into the second part of the book where I was fighting the urge to give up and not even finish it. I didn't buy the book for Jacob's perspective, I wanted Bella's. But I stuck through just to see what Meyer was thinking...hoping should would reign in the insanity. The last part of the book had some (very few) echos of the other three books, but instead of getting to the point, she would drag out scenes for pages when it didn't need to be that way. I really had very high hopes for this book and I HOPE they do not make this one into a movie...I shudder at the thought. I originally planned on only giving one star but the 'third' book kind of saved itself from completely drowning. It still only gets two stars though. Save yourself the 20 bucks and make up your own ending. Trust me, it will turn out much better than this.

Videos created require 3ivx codec, which the installation program installs. If you want troublefree recording in order to playback videos only using Windows Media Player at your computer then this is a great gadget as the video quality is very very good.  If you want to use any other player then you probably will have sound issues. Same goes for moving the videos to devices designed to play videos - great picture, no sound.

I have been sim-racing for a while now with everything mounted to my computer desk. And my biggest peeve was the fact that it was a hassle removing everything when I was done racing, so I would leave everything on my desk and work around it. This wasn't very comfortable and I needed to find a solution. Well This Seat is really great it allows me to have everything setup and I can simply pull it away from the computer desk when I'm done racing.The build on this is very impressive, its very sturdy steel and will handle just about any abusive driving situation that you will throw at it. It came with all the hardware needed to attach the G25 to the base plates which only adds to the sturdiness of the whole setup. I am 6'2 and was able to find a comfortable driving position with the amount of adjustments this seat allows.My only problem was with the optional gear shift attachment as it doesn't have a vertical height adjustment feature and I find it sits a little low and will take some getting used to.Overall this is a great addition to any sim racers setup and I highly recommend it!!

Let me preface this by saying I think Meyers had an EXTREMELY difficult task of wrapping up this series and making everyone happy at the same time.  I also still think she is a great writer!(Spoilers below...read with caution)The romance between Edward and Bella was lacking.. A LOT!  The connection Bella and Edward have, which is why I fell in love with the series at first, was missing.  The honeymoon was sad.  No romance...just harsh and cold.Secondly, I understand Meyer's reason for making the intimate parts of the book more PG...but after the gruesome description of Renesmee's birth...I got to thinking, why is violence and gore so much more acceptable than sex?Speaking of Renesmee and this is probably trivial...can't stand the name.  And why are we calling Jasper, Jazz??The standoff with the Volturi in the end was long and dragged out and frankly boring.  Yes my darlings...hopefully this will come to an end, soon!  :)To leave this on a good note...The wedding was great.  I didn't mind that Jacob imprinted on Renesmee - this would make a great spin off for the series. Finally we got to see some romance between Bella and Edward at the end of the story...to little, too late.  I like the confidence Bella begins to gain after she becomes a vampire.

I don't know if the problem would worse without using this product, but it certainly isn't good with it.  The first bottle that I purchased, I purchased directly from the manufacturer's website and the cost was almost double.  Through Amazon, I saved a considerable amount of money, but isn't working.  Makes me wonder if it is actually the exact same product that they are providing.

This is the second kettle I bought - I had to take the first one back because it rusted on the inside.  I bought this kettle after looking at what was available in the retail stores.  It felt more solid than the competitors.  I was hesitant in buying it because some online reviews indicated the inside of the kettle had a smell that would not go away.  There was a very slight smell at first (a new product smell) - but it disappeared after I rinsed it out.  It heats the water very quickly and shuts off automatically after the water has reached a boil - which is nice if you happen to be absentminded.  It is noisy when you first turn it on but quiets down when the water starts to boil.  I'm glad I spent the extra money and bought this brand. I'm very happy with it.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      

There is a reason why this movie wasn't nominated for many Oscars and those few were for technical items.  The first half is a sappy comedy and the second half an over-wrought mess.  Australia is a beautiful country but it seemed that many of the vistas were green screen and digitally generated.  Jackman might be a good Oscar telecast host but he will never will an Oscar himself.

After much research including reading the reviews here I took the plunge and purchased the Breville Wok. I don't have a gas stove so as far as I am concerned this the closest one can come to a wok over gas. It is also very easy to clean which was a big plus compared to the old electric wok that I had. It is well worth the money!

Well, I disagree with the others here.  I haven't done that much with it, but I really like the way the new Word works.  Instead of a drop-down menu when you click on something like "insert," you get the whole bar (now called a ribbon) replaced.I use tables a lot and I like all the features that are sitting right in sight on this new version.

The toaster is bad because it toasts one side more than the other, the slots are too shallow for most bread (even sideways) and too narrow for bagels (so basically it is only good for English muffins).Also, right on cue after the 30 Amazon warranty expired, the egg poacher stopped working completely, so I'm SOL.Very cheaply made, poor design, and poor execution.Do yourself a favor and just toast your English muffins to your desired darkness while frying an egg in a pan or poaching it however you do it.  Instead of something that does both this product does neither.

I bought 2 of these for our computer and our son's new school laptop. While the drive hardware works fine and can be connected via USB or Firewire or e-sata, the software is unacceptable. On our XP machine, setup wasn't nearly as intuitive as it could be or should have been, but we did manage to get it installed and set to back up two "plans" which included files from both of our internal drives. After about 5 hours of backup, everything looked like it was working. However, the software is supposed to work in the background and yield system resources to all other tasks. This is not really the case. Even though it ran minimized, it routinely used 30% of the CPU load, and seriously slowed the machine for all tasks. We have also had a number of hangs/lockups and have lost some setting files due to this software as well- the machine is much faster and more stable when the Memeo software isn't running. Additionally, its very active software, popping up an annoying notice box over the system tray basically constantly.  We finally had to resort to installing the StartupCPL tool (this is a very useful freeware tool) to prevent it from automatically running at boot up, so we can just start it manually when we want the backup updated. However, it has now lost one of my backup plans (the backed up files are still on the my book, it just wont back up any file updates anymore). We followed the instructions to re-attach the inactive backup but it will no longer see it. We have written to WD a number of times and no useful info has been provided. At all. They did basically blame Memeo for the software and said I should look for updates from Memeo.Now, I'm not sure if Id call this part worse or just as bad (or maybe a blessing in disguise)but the software will not even install on our son's vista premium 64 bit OS machine (even in admin mode). It blinks a few times, nothing happens, and then quits!In my opinion, this software is unfit for use. August 2008

I can not give you a review on this product yet being I have not recieved it as of yet.  I ordered it to be sent to an APO wich is where I am, but it was sent to my home address wich I am not at, unfortunately not only do I sacrafice a year of my life to spend it in Afghanistan but I also sacrafice my money, I have to pay for the shipping of my products then pay again to have them shipped to me here where I need them. I have now sworn off Amazon.com being this is not the first time I got the short end of the stick from them, I have alwasys said fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, well shame on me and I will not give them the chance for a third time mainly for the fact that I have told them of both incidents and I have not gotten even the slightest appolagy. It might be me but the way I was raised that if I were to do some one wrong or not serve them correctly I was to some how find a way to make it right with that person. so much for respect these days.Now I wonder if they will even post this review being that it is not a very positave review. John Smith

My home network was the first network that I had ever set up.  I have found the Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router to be a great unit.  The &quot;G&quot; standard means that it works much faster than the &quot;B&quot; standard for wireless applications.  I have two computers hard wired to this router, and use it's wireless capability for my third computer, a laptop.The only problems I had setting up the network had nothing to do with the router.  I have Norton Internet Security installed on my computers, and this caused communication problems until I figured out how to set up the firewalls to allow proper operation.Overall, I think this is an excellent router, and offers excellent performance for a reasonable expense.

There is no doubt that the iPod touch is really really cool. It's an amazing little device......until you really try to use it. I naively assumed that it would work as a PDA: it has a calendar and contacts, right? After using one for a month, I'm getting rid of it. The cool factor is long since gone, and I realize that in many ways I liked my 1998 PalmPilot better than I like this thing. I have used Palms heavily for a decade.Things that a 1998 PalmPilot could do better than an iPod touch:o The iPod is unreliable. The most frustrating is that the date/time/time zone likes to reset itself randomly.o There is no ToDo app, and none of the downloadable ones sync well with Outlook.o The calendar has no search capability - indeed, there is no global search. This is a dealbreaker when you have (as I do) a calendar with a decade of information, and over a thousand contacts.o The auto corrections were clearly not tested: words get trashed beyond all recognition. If you are looking at the keyboard typing and don't see that it has suggested something off the wall, you end up with text that's beyond useless: a typo you might recognize and work around. If you type a lot of acronyms, usability is terrible.o There is no caps lock - one of these little things that makes life a little bit harder, esp if you use a lot of acronyms.o No search. I know I said it already, but it's a big problem.o Memos are not syncable with Outlook.o No cut and pasteo No block deleteo No zooming of text in long calendar or contact notes: the text is forced to very smallo In long contact notes, the only way to see the text is to edit them.o There is no usable calendar alarm. I had to use it a couple of times to realize that it does beep, just so softly that you can't hear it from a pocket.  Loud Palm alarms were incredibly useful as notifications of meetings and as a customizable alarm clock. (If I have a very early meeting two months from now, I can set a Palm as an alarm right now.)o The phone #s in contacts can't understand nonstandard numbers. If a number is 123-456-7890 ext 321, the software will try to be clever by changing it to 1234567890321. Thanks.The PDA apps Apple tries to cover with MobileMe. Don't bother. Friends have had the sync overwrite the wrong data, and backup is out of your hands. But for me it's a bad idea: I am never going to keep my calendar or contacts on a server I can't control, and that's true of many many people.Over the course of the last month or two, I've asked people who use iPhones/iPod touches who used to use Palms what they use for todo lists, or how they do calendar searches. Answers include using using postits for todos, looking sheepish, and being resigned to not being able to do what they used to do.Again, it was really cool for a couple of days. But I'm getting rid of it.

In this book, you find Bella & Edward reunited. A well-deserved reunion for everything they went through in book 2. But the thrill quickly wears off as Bella turns inward in angst about  her feelings for Jacob. It got a little tiresome as she complained yet again why Jacob and Edward can't "just play nice". When the answer should be obvious! Bella's not dumb. So I was disappointed when it took her most of the book to figure it out. The book would have been more interesting written partially from Edward's perspective - his need to make it up to Bella for abandoning her in New Moon and his jealousy towards Jacob as he attempts again and again to move in on his girlfriend. But the biggest flaw of this book was the lack of plot. We know that Victoria is out there somewhere plotting her death, but that aspect of it was so overshadowed by Bella's mundane angst that left me wondering if Victoria gave up. She came through in the end, but underwhelmingly. Her schemes were predictable from the first quarter of the book and so was her ending. Also, the moral preachiness of no sex before marriage theme was more than irritating. This is a vampire fiction novel. Not a church sermon! I found it hard to believe that Edward would have held on to that trite human thinking when he's lived as a modern, all powerful vampire for the last 100 years. Quaint and silly human notions of morality would be the last thing he would be concerned about, I would think. Concerns for her safety would be the only thing on his mind, not some out-dated, narrow notion of right and wrong. But this book does have some redeeming qualities. I enjoyed the back-stories of Rosalie, Jasper and Sam. It pumped the much needed life into this book. Also, Edward's sacrafices for her throughout this book was really touching. I'm sure he did not enjoy watching his girlfriend sleep in someone else's arms as Jacob attempts to thaw her from hypothermia. We only got an inkling of Edward's displeasure at this, when it should have been a raging inferno worthy of 1000 suns! Held in check only by his wish to see Bella happy. This book's okay. I'll still read book 4 after this. But I thought it could have been better.

I am going to read the 4th book in order to find out what happens but it is hard to really get in to a book when you can't stand the main character.  Can Bella be any more annoying and immature?  I think she should end up with Jacob because he is younger than her and therefore more at her maturity level.  Edward is miles ahead of her and frankly I find it very hard to believe that he is supposed to be so in love with her.  What's to love?  A selfish, whiny baby?  No way.

This gate is very good.  I like that it's hands free.  It's very sturdy, and as much as my child tries to get out, she can't.  I did have to by the extension.  It's very easy to set up.  The only problem I found was securing the gett to the walls.  The feet that secured it to the wall interfered with the molding so I had to raise the gate a little bit.

I can't say enough about this mini-series. It was a five star on every level. It was totally entertaining and it always kept us pulled into the story. The acting was incredible and raw. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney gave amazing performances. It was fascinating from a historical perspective. I learned so much, and I was so absolutely inspired by the story of John Adams and his family. This series showed the power of conviction John Adams had, but it also showed his imperfections of those of others. I also learned a lot about how they lived back then. It was so interesting!The relationship between John Adams and his wife was explored in depth. As amazing as he was, his wife was also incredible. Laura Linney did an outstanding job portraying her. The sets and costumes were well done. The script was engaging and moving. I have to say that each week this series kept us wanting more. Honestly I'm a guy who generally doesn't like period movies, but this really appealed to me anyway.  Bottom line: I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in American history or politics, and to anyone who likes a good drama. Really I would recommend this movie to anyone!

Why does this film annoy?  Hathaway is a typical "deglammed" Hollywood femme in search of self-esteem and an Oscar--chain smoke, sarcastic comments, hair slightly unkempt, tears.  Film has too much yelling, whining, accusations, and faux soul-searching.  All done to annoying effect with a hand-held camera.  At its end you feel like you have watched a reality series or a 'very special' episode of Oprah.  The only redeeming element is Debra Winger, playing a character not too far from Shirley MacLaine's Aurora in Winger's 1983 Terms of Endearment.  If she loves her daughters so much why leave the wedding first?  why come to the rehearsal dinner late? She seems to be a woman who will only give so much of herself as a mother and a wife to tragic results [revealed three-quarters of the way in the film].  Were there cut scenes with Winger?  She deserved an Oscar nom more than Hathaway.Note to screenwriter:  how come you couldn't write a part for Lena Horne, your grandmother??

After being a joystick pilot dating all the way back to FS98, I finally upgraded to the CH Products Yoke and Pedals this year.  I should have done this years ago, the fun of desktop flying with these products is very much enhanced.  I am a real Private Pilot and I use FSX to plan and practice all my real life flights before I go.  The addition of the CH Products Yoke and Pedals has added another dimension of reality to my practice sessions, and I truly believe these sessions enhance the safety of my real flying.  This product has the solid look and feel of quality hardware the minute you take it out of the box.  The pedal motion is smooth and repeatable, and very natural to me.

I really wanted this machine to work - nice design, good features, good price.The first one I got had the little carafe cap broken.  Not a big deal, I emailed the company and they promised to send me another one.  About a week later, the unit simply stopped brewing.  I called the support line for troubleshooting and they told me to send the unit back for replacement.I sent it back and Amazon shipped another one out promptly.  Everything was fine the first day, but when I picked up the carafe the next day, the bottom came right off in my hand exposing the innards of the seal mechanism for the thermos.  The spot welds all along the rim hadn't taken and the carafe literally came apart in my hands.Again I called the company asking if this was normal.  Again they told me to return it and "give them one more chance".  So I tried to - like I say, I really wanted this machine to work.Unfortunately the response I got from Amazon was:"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."Probably just as well, after going through 2 units in under 2 weeks, the chances of the third one lasting anywhere near as long as I'd want it to are about nil.So you can roll the dice and perhaps get yourself a good one - I did it twice and unfortunately got 2 lemons in a row.  Buyer beware.  (I never did get the replacement cap from the first one.  When I called about that, the rep I spoke to told me that they get so many calls that it's impossible for them to follow up on each one to make sure it was resolved.  I can see why they're overwhelmed with support calls and it's even more disturbing that customer service lets things slip through the cracks like this...)(about a month later)I replaced this with a Braun KF600... the choice is obvious having had both machines: the Braun is simply a better designed and better constructed machine for about the same price.  Save yourself the hassle and buy it instead.  It takes up less counter space, has a gold cone filter instead of the ill-fitting #4 paper filters, there's no twist cap on the carafe to fight with...To be fair, it doesn't have a timer.  Not a big deal for me.

Researched for a replacement for my old WaterPik, and came across this portable Oral Irrigator. Found lots of complaints about poor quality in the current WaterPik line. This Panasonic had many positive reviews and it was portable.The irragator has performed flawlessly over the last two months. Batteries last about a month with daily use.My only complaint is a small water tank, although it does fill up very easily. Compared to my old waterPik, it is down on pressure.It works well and is quiet. Just needs a bit more punch.

it ended how we all new it should be - in a perfect world.  i'm just sad b/c this series had so much potential. bella never lost anything - no struggle for life, no one close dies.  it was a perfect world - a pathetic hooray. it was a hard book to get through, simply b/c i was so tired of bella's self-depreciating way of seeing herself and her annoying need to please everyone.  edward's obsession with keeping bella safe got old, and jake no longer seemed attractive in that "i am life" sort of way.  it all just felt very a childish, fairy tale book - which, if you read the ending, was exactly what it was supposed to be.

TurboTax Deluxe Federal + State 2007I receive capital gains dividends and most of them are received in the last month of the year. Form 2210 is used to show how the uneven income was received during the year, and to avoid a penalty by showing the estimated payments were accurate. Turbo Tax Deluxe generated this form in previous years, but it does not do it this year. This is a crippled product designed to have you enter the information, and extort you to purchase a more expensive version of the software, or pay an even greater amount in penalty. I intend to request my purchase money back based upon their Maximum Refund Guarantee - by not filling out form 2210 you have to pay more tax.

I've never used anything but an old fashioned ice cream maker before (using ice and rock salt), so I was thrilled when I saw an ice cream maker that was self contained. From what the box said, I had no idea I would have to freeze the bowl for 24 hours before even using it. Imagine buying a crock pot and then learning when you get home that you have to preheat the bowl in the oven for 2 hours? That's how I felt! I have very little freezer space, so I had to thaw out some important things just to make room for this. I tried using this ice cream maker twice. I do not like custard based ice creams at all--so I went with a family favorite recipe that uses a milk base but makes an awesome ice cream. They've always had success with using that recipe in their old fashioned ice cream maker, so I figured I would have success too. Wrong! I froze the bowl and refrigerated my ice cream mix for 24 hours before trying to make the ice cream. At 30 minutes into the process, all I had was a few ice crystals in the mix. I though maybe I should wait longer to let it harden up more, but as time went by the ice crystals melted again and it became complete liquid. So I am very dissapointed and now I have to make a trip to the store to return this.

I tried the Norelco shaver to keep my head shaved, but it did not work well.  I then tried the Braun Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver, and it did a very good job of both shaving my head (keeping it bald) and, shaving my face.  It is not quite as good as a blade when it comes to shaving your face, but it is much faster than the blade, and does an OK job.  In addition, one of the selling points for me was that you don't have to bother cleaning the electric razor.  You just place it in its cradle and press the cleaning button, and it will automatically clean the razor and set it up again for your next shave.  Overall, it's a very good product.  I recommend it for guys that want to keep their heads shaved.  (Suggestion:  Have your wife or girl friend help you with shaving the back of the head.  It is a lot easier than if you try to do it yourself.)

I've been a n52 "padder" since the unit came out, and I love it. However, it leaves little the imagination as far as looks are concerned, and seeing as how I just purchased a Saitek X52 joystick, and a Logitech G15 gaming keyboard, with all their blue glowy goodness, decided to pick up the Pro Gamer Command to match my desktop.And it looked great! However....I decided to set up my pad with the software included, and since it was already installed with my Saitek X52 (all Saitek products use the same software to keymap) I immediately knew how to program the keys. The software found the Gamepad immediately, and after a few minutes to tweaking the keys, off I go to play Battlefield 2. Now mind you, the Pro Gamer Command has a few more keys than the n52. However, where you normally have the thumbpad, it is now replaced with an analog stick. Getting the software to recognize a simple UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys for gaming was as simple as....well, it wasn't that simple. You have to set the software to deadzones, etc. since the software sees the mini thumbstick as a joystick of sorts. The biggest problem with this gamepad however, is the "lag" of the keys. As a FPS gamer, and if you also play FPS games you'd understand, that fast keypresses are not uncommon. In Battlefield 2, switching from your Shock Paddles to your gun then going prone all in the spawn of 3 seconds happens all the time. And this is where the gamepad failed. Horribly. If you try to strafe left and hit prone, it'll happen as you want it to %70 of the time. You'll either go prone. Or you'll strafe. I even had the problem with moving forward, and going prone, that my guy would still be moving forward while prone even after I let the key go. I had to repress the forward key again to make it stop. And this is not user error folks. Say what you will, but I know how to use the software to set the keys up from using my X52 joystick (GREAT joystick btw). All in all, it looks great on the desk, and more than likely will play well with RTS games and the like, but for FPS games, stay away. Stick with the Nostromo n52 instead. It's cheaper to buy, and is rock solid.It just doesn't look nice.

You get exactly what the product description says you will get. It is a sturdy product and pretty easy to set up. You'll need to wiggle and push some bars into place for the initial set up but once everything is in, the crate is good. The handlebars up top make it easy to move around. It is a bit heavy, but if it were any lighter, the integrity of the crate would probably be compromised. I like how my dog is able to see in all directions. Being able to see his surroundings helps him to feel more calm and comfortable. At night, I drape a sheet over part of the crate to create that "cave-like" feel that helps him feel cozy and sleep well. Overall, I would recommend this product.

A company I work for bought this camera to be able to use in our  training division.  The idea was to get a camera that could take some good still pictures, good video footage, be small and compact, and easy to use.  We really liked the idea of no clunky video tapes since all the footage goes on a small SD card that you can pop in most any newer computer.  For the record I would consider myself an fairly advanced user of digital media and editing software. No genius for sure, but I've spent many hours in front of a screen editing pictures and video and puting together many training videos.  After using the camera for the past two months, many hundreds of pictures and several hours of video clips later, here is what I found.The camera itself is awesome.  The still pictures it takes are great quality and it's about as simple to take pictures on as a regular digital still camera.  The video operation is similar to other video cameras and the quality of the video is stunning.  The quality and ease of use in capturing the media you want just can't be beat.  Anyone can operate this camera without any problems at all, regardless of your technical "know how".Now for the reason I rated this camera so low...  Once you have that stunning video inside the camera, there is no simple, easy, user friendly way to get it back out onto something you can pop in your 2 year old DVD player and show the family.  The software that Canon packages with the camera to install on your computer is absolute junk.  It's software that is comparable to what you'd find in a Dollar Store somewhere.  The user interface is so poor that even advanced users will be pulling their hair out to get the thing to work what little features it has.  No problem you say (like I did), you'll just use one of the easy programs like Windows Movie Maker to make your video....Sorry, Movie Maker isn't able to work with the format of video that the camera records.  And that is the root of the problem.  The AVCHD format that the camera uses has very, very, very few programs that will work with it and they all cost a hundred bucks or more to buy.So, in conclusion, from an average guy that is pretty tech savy...stay away from this camera and any like it that use some special wiz-bang format to record with (specifically like AVCHD).  The technology is good but the software to work with it still has a few years to go.  Go with a good quality Mini-DV camera that you can actually use to make videos on with your home computer....and you'll save pulling your hair out!

I haven't had any problems using this product.  It does what it says it does.  The only thing I would have liked to know ahead of time is that it makes a bit of noise for about 3 to 4 minutes. . .I planned on noise, but perhaps not as loud, and not for as long.  My co-worker has one that I never hear, so I wasn't expecting the noise factor.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

So, I didn't really know anything about this series except for the fact that it was about a vampire and human romance.  I don't even read very much so you would think an easy read like this would probably satisfy me.  Although I'm 29 years old, I tried to read this with the teenage audience in mind.  I actually didn't mind Bella so much in Twilight besides the excessive emphasis of how beautiful Edward was which got annoying at times.  However, I rationalized Bella's behavior in the first book because I realized that I acted similarly gushing over my first crush in highschool.  Anyways, Twilight was engaging and I thought Bella and Edward had chemistry.  On the other hand, the flow was terrible in New Moon which made many events in the novel unbelievable for me.  Edward was just so emo for me...how his family just took off in the beginning seemed out of character for the Cullens.  I understood the reasons at the end of the novel but I felt that Meyers should have explored their personalities and the nature of vampires a bit further in the beginning (and cut down on the the big chunk of Bella's depression).  Later on in the novel, the Victoria-werewolves-Bella conflict gets suddenly pushed back just to be rushed into the Bella-vampires-Edward's suicide plot.  The entire last half of the book felt rushed and I didn't feel any climax like in Twilight.  There was horrible continuity.  It was as if Meyers finalized her brainstorming.  The writing got lazy, her writing style got worse towards the end.  Edward's suicide attempt felt like a joke.  Even Edward's and Bella's chemistry felt phony at the end.  I also started to dislike Bella very much towards the end with the way she treated her father and Jacob.  After reading so much about Bella's "gaping hole" for the first 1/2 of the book, I was really hoping that Meyers would put a little more substance into her character such as go in more depth about her relationships with Charlie and Renee so that I would be able to forgive her a bit.  Yet, that didn't happen.  This novel was too straight forward, very shallow, and thus very disappointing for me.

I purchased this product because I liked the idea of being able to easily remove the leg pouch to change diapers. I purchased the small which is designed to fit 7 to 14 lbs. The first time I used it, I realized it did not fit my son.  Although he weighs 9 1/2 lbs., the wing stretched far past the velcro fastener. My husband and I watched him wiggle his arm free in 15 minutes.  I would suggest that you just purchase a regular receiving blanket.  Just make sure it is large enough (about 30x40) so that you have enough fabric to effectively wrap your baby.

I have had no specific problem with both of them except the latter caused some problems with the time machine of my imac.

I think I can summarize my opinion about the product as follows:  it's cute, but it's not a REAL ice cream maker.  If you want a real ice cream maker buy one that you can add salt and ice to until the job is done.  This product runs out of cooling power after about 25 minutes and at that point there is no way to fix it (perhaps if you purchased a second bowl, and transferred the mixture to it ...).  I have tried to make 5 batches of ice cream so far and the results have ranged from VERY SOFT soft serve to cold soup (and I did follow the special instructions:  bowl in the freezer for at least 24 hrs, ingredients refrigerated for at least 24 hrs, no alcohol until the last 2 minutes, etc, etc).  I suspect this product may make acceptable sorbet but I have yet to try it.  So the bottom line is if you will be happy with very small batches, planning ahead to be sure the bowl has been frozen for at least 24 hrs and the ingredients refrigerated for 24 hrs, no alcohol until the last moment, and a product that will need to be frozen for at least 2 more hours before it is solid (or close to it) then this may work for you.

Make sure to follow the directions carefully and you will not regret your purchase.

I'm giving this product two stars because it arrived on time, and in good condition.  I think it would have worked well for a smaller cat, or a very small dog, like the one pictured in the product photo, but the description does promise to support more weight than that.  Unfortunately, weight is not the only issue to consider:  My cat is large at 20 lbs--not really fat, just a big breed--and the steps were very out of proportion to his natural stride.  I tried coaxing him up and down a few times, but it was clear that his legs and paws were too big for the scale of these steps.  In addition to the size of the steps, the plastic construction meant that the whole thing moved a little when my cat put his weight on it.  Cat's really don't like feeling unsteady ground beneath them, and this movement scared him.  I ended up buying a much more expensive carpeted, wood-construction ramp for the foot of our bed, and he has had no trouble using that.

I had been looking for a backlit keyboard for a long time, but most of them seem to be very pricey.  I finally found this one on sale for about half off and it's excellent.  The key action is very smooth and quiet and the keys feel solid.  The backlight is nice and I have no problems reading the keys at night.  I have only used the LCD a little bit, but do far it has been very useful.  I like the feature to turn off the windows key, who hasn't hit that in a game and been pulled out to the desktop!  I'm very happy with the purchase and would buy another.

This was a great product until most of my applications started to hung.I thought it was because of OSX , so I reinstalled everything.Same crap. I just unplugged everything from my computer, and everything worked great. Little by little, I plugged back all external HD I had, until it was the MyBook turn. Application hunging came back ! From my researches (thanks to the guys at #macosx@undernet.org channels), it looks like it is the enclosure of the HD. If you are going to use an external hard drive, you want to be sure that the enclosure will use OXFORD chips. Not like this one. GREAT HD, but not for OS X !

I really wanted to love this machine- it brews coffee SO fast- fast enough to make serving multiple cups no issue, the water temp is perfect, there are so many flavors I was excited about. But the coffee was WEAK. How can you afford to pay $150 and extra money for pods when the coffee isn't any good? Even the bold flavors! It's NOT a roast issue! You should be able to get a medium roasted coffee that's not the color of tea (even on the smallest size setting)- it reminds me of coffee from Denny's. And I'm really not a coffee snob either- my favorite brand is folgers. But this doesn't even come close to an avg. cup of folgers!

Since the trend seems to be the production and purchase of items that make phone calls, play mp3s, serve as calulators, take pictures, play movies and change the cat litter box, this coffeemaker may not impress some people. It just makes coffee. It uses normal coffee filters (the flat bottom type), brews the coffee and turns off the warming plate after two hours. It does not do anything else. I, personally LIKE that. After all, how many mp3 players does one need? What kind of tech-crazy person wants to make phone calls on their coffee maker? Who can talk before they have had their first cup of coffee in the first place?If you are looking for a coffee maker that just makes coffee and does it rapidly and without any complicated instructions that must be followed (who can follow complicated instructions before their first cup of coffee, either?) then this would be a good choice. If you want to film a movie with your coffee maker, this is not the coffee maker for you.

Became unusable only 2 days after I started using it ("Write-protected" and "Unable to format messages", that kind of stuff...) Checked the PNY Web site, downloaded their low-level formating utility and received a msg that it only would only work on ICxxxx models (whatever that means; my suspicion is that the drives break down faster than support update the formatter) and refused to format. Attempting to contact PNY support was met with a resounding silence. A cheap enough drive, but I guess you only get what you pay for; if you're looking for a good high-capacity USB drive, you may want to look elsewhere.

I just bought this last weekend, and it is pretty handy.  It does work very well on thick course hair (back, legs, arms and chest) but not so much on fine hair (knuckles, feet) and may require a few passes for those.  I was surprised at how well this worked on my back, at least in the places I could reach.  I love using it in the shower and it is a snap to clean.  One complaint, there is no extension to get to those hard to reach places like some similar products I have seen.  Over all I like it though.

This fourth installment of what has become known as the "Twilight" series is a must-read for anyone who has found themselves sleeplessly reading the first three novels in the course of a very late night. The 700+ page book is as addicting as the first book by Stephanie Meyer, if not more so. The outcome could not have been better for Edward, for Jacob, and, of course, for Bella. Theirs is a completely intertwined love that will last beyond the end of time. It makes me want to be a vampire!

I just purchased this oven, and I'm very dissatisfied with how it makes toast. The top of the toast is done perfectly, but the bottom is not as toasted. The rack is in the right place, etc... but I notice visually that the elements on top get hotter/redder/brighter than the bottom. Is this normal? Does everyone who says it makes perfect toast have to turn the toast over? I'm trying to figure out if there's something wrong with my machine or if they all work this way. Cuisinart's customer service was completely unhelpful and kept just recommending I play with the toast darkness setting. Is my problem how this appliance works, or do I have a defective one? Any advice?

Even if this series shows some interesting and beautiful scenes and animals, also thought that FINALLY we could avoid watching the violent 'mother nature' in action, at least for some time...didn't happen.Personally would love to have FINALLY a DVD that shows the amazing beauty of this planet without the overrated, abundant violent and blood of the already overseen processes of nature inside videos.So this is it; if you like that type of animal violence, blood and natural cruelty this is the one to get !And if not, I recommend the IMAX series or the Buddha Bar DVD that will only show the positive aspect of it with even better shots and colors.Already re-selling it in case you're interested !

OK.. well I was super hyped when I saw Gweneth Paltrow on Oprah and heard her talking about this workout. I have been a professional dancer for almost 30 years now so this seemed like it would be perfect for me... So I ordered both of the videos.. the Dance and the Matt workout. There is a lot of cool things about this video but more importantly, I think the Dance workout is dangerous. No wonder Gweneth threw her knee out.. although I'm not sure if it was from doing this workout but I think it would be very easy to get injured performing this class. It is a great challenge just to complete all of the dances in a row and follow Tracey but this kind of workout is better done in a class with a live instructor and mirrors where you can see all angles as well as a proper floating floor to help you withstand all the jumping and direction changes. Tracy's cueing is not great either and that can be very frustrating as well as her constant pouting into the camera. I am such a big fan of Karen Voight and The Method Pilates workouts with percise timing and cueing and a no nonsense aproach, that these workout DVD's left me very disappointed. You WILL work up a sweat and the matt workout is great but I think you could do a much more efficient work out in one hour (rather than 2 with Tracey)with the same results if not better with Karen Voights "Slim in 10" dvd workout... as well as prevent yourself from being injured!

The FURminator is amazing. It is a very durable tool and it performs far beyond expectations. It works equally well for short or long-hair cats. Even better, our two short-hair cats don't mind it and our daughter's long-hair cat actually enjoys it. Use it outside with your cat because it cleans out an amazing amount of hair. When finished, the cat's coat feels very smooth and you will see no shedding for a week or two afterwards.

This review is from: Australia  [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      

I cannot understand how the Oscars could almost completely ignore this epic motion picture. This is old fashioned movie making at its best!. Sure it is sometimes corny and sugar-coated, but at the same time it is cruel and poignant. This movie has it all: spectacular cinematography, a sweeping musical score, great performances by the entire cast, laughter, romance, tears, action, you name it. The movie brought back memories of "the Cowboys", "Father Goose", "Pearl Harbor", "The Lion King","Gone with the Wind","Cinema Paradiso" and obviously "The Wizard of Oz". In other words , it is a cinematic celebration set in a continent which culture is very much unknown, and a mystery to many. The director achieved his goal in his homage to his native continent of Australia!. The Blu-ray transfer is magnificent, and surpassed any 35mm projection I have seen in theatres recently. It looked like 70mm in sharpness front projected in full 1080p on my 10.5 foot wide PANAVISION screen. This is a MUST have in any serious film collector's library!

I thought this movie would be funny with Stiller, Black and Downey in it. I was very upset with paying $20 for this movie and being disgusted with it. Every other word out of anyone's mouth is a F-bomb, I guess they thought if they could cuss alot it would make the movie better. There were a VERY few moments where you may laugh, but the rest was not worth it. I dont know about most people, but watching Tom Cruise with a fake gut and bald head screaming and yelling at everyone on the screen and then trying to save his screen time by dancing at the end of the movie was HORRIBLE.You need to rent this movie before purchasing it unless you are into crude humor.

When I first plugged the 512 Cruzer Micro into the front USB 2 port of my PC it locked my PC instantly.  No crash, blue screen, etc.  Just locked.   It worked ok on another PC.  I called SanDisk and they said the problem is power.  Some USB2 ports (including the one on the front of my PC connected directly to the motherboard) do not provide adequate power for the Cruzer Micro.  I've used several other thumbdrives (of lower capacity) without a problem with the same port.  Maybe it's the fancy blue LED that sucks the juice?  I have no idea.  I got an extension cable (which SanDisk warned me might not work!) and am using one of the rear USB2 ports, which works ok.SLOW:  I haven't used any other large capacity USB2 thumbdrives, but from reviews of other drives it seems this one is slow when transferring large numbers of files. (500 files 200MB took about 18 minutes) -- that is writing the files to the drive.It is also extraordinarily slow (10 minutes) to delete those files.I called SanDisk and they recommended reformatting the drive when deleting large numbers of files.That seems dumb to me (and I have other files I don't need to delete...)Also the MP3 Companion is constructed like something you would buy for $5 (very flimsy plastic switches) and has a difficult interface.  It also doesn't work if you have a folder of non-mp3s on your Cruzer.All that said -- The cruzer is small and solidly made.  It looks nice and basically functions if your USB2 port has enough power.

I was thrilled to purchase an ice cream maker that would make ice cream with the touch of a button.  However, after only a month of using the ice cream maker, following manufacturer instructions, the inner gel that is supposed to freeze solid to make the ice cream cold, ceased to freeze.  It could never freeze solidly.I called to get a replacement bowl and was told that not only would I have to pay to ship the old bowl back, but I would also have to pay for them to ship me a replacement bowl.  This is absolutely ridiculous.Considering the CSR explained to me that it was company policy, I guaranteed them I would never purchase a Cuisinart/Conair product again.  It is unfortunate, as I have often heard good things about their brand.

I store the bucket in my freezer so it is always ready to use.  Had it about 30 days and used it 4 times.  I recommend the Ben and Jerry's cookbook - basic recipes.

I ordered this after ordering another omron BP monitor for my husband. I thought would be great as I have the software for my pedimeter.  Note my software folder with this was empty, this had to be a return item.  I have used this item for 2 months now.  I take 3 readings each arm within 1.5 minutes of each other aka every 30 seconds. On this unit my BP goes from 143/90 to 98/60 within 2 minutes. This has done this since day one and the tube for the cuff does not stay in.  The omron 705 cp with a printer that I ordered for my husband.  Today 3 read outs on both my left and right arm. Left 122/88 pulse 85, 120/83 pulse 84, 120/78 pulse 85.  Right arm 116/81 pulse 86, 120/81 pulse 86, 120/86 pulse 86.  When I was missing the software I should have returned this item.

Overall, the unit is a decent player. The plastic casing feels cheap, but the function is still pretty nice. It's not the kind of player that will turn heads with looks, features, and bells and whistles, but it does it's job as a nice basic player.Some people may not like the AA battery usage, but I prefer it since it makes it easy to replace a battery when you can't plug into anything anywhere - like, for example, when traveling. AA batteries are ubiquitous and can be found in a pinch.Bottom line: If you are looking for a basic mp3 player (and FM tuner) that just does job with being flashy, this is a good buy.

One of my very good memories of my childhood are the Battlestar Galctica movies and series, I am a big fan. The first time I heard about this new production I was very happy, then I read the opinion of other fanatics of the old series about how bad this new series was and I became disappointed. But, because I am a very big fan, it was my duty to saw this new one. After this, I only can say that all the people who rate the new BSG with 5 stars are completely right. This series are very, very , very amusing and I really want to buy it (I own the old series). When I saw the finale of the 13rd chapter I stopped my breathing, what?, no continuation? It depressed me for a very long time. Now I know that there is a second season to come and I'm eagerly waiting for it. Thank's BSG. Note. The old series was  very good, but it was for another time, this new one is for the present time and I hope for the future years.

Bought the Sansa Fuze weeks ago and have loved it.  It holds much of my collection, plays radio jams, can record form radio and voice, and I was even surprised to find On the Go Deleting and play list making, which wasn't even mentioned on the reviews I read. it uses the same proprietary connection cable as other sansas, and needs no new software. I have 3 now that all work with it.I also bought a rubberish case to protect my investment, but the player's rubber back feels solid an durable, and can't show smudges. Its features are its strongest point, as well as its sound.The only negative is that I sometimes need to click the scroll wheel twice for it to function, as about 5% of the time it is unresponsive.

"3 and a half stars, are you kidding me?"I know that's what's going through your mind, and probably rightfully so.  I mean, this movie has been lauded as one of the greatest of the decade.  And truthfully speaking, it is a good movie; better than some others I've been forced to endure.  But it's not "great".  That's what this review will tell you - why I say the movie isn't "Great".Background - I did watch, and quite enjoyed, Batman Begins.  If you haven't seen that movie, you don't need to in order to understand the events of Dark Knight, though some experiences are made better if you did (such as the relationship between Wayne and Rachel).  But what Batman Begins did right is the backstory; how Batman got his training and expertise, as well as his morality and sense of justice.  Also, his basic understanding of the criminal mind is briefly explained here, and his development of the various tools of the trade that he now uses to dole out the justice.  Because of that, it's a good idea to watch Batman Begins first, even if not required, because it sets the stage nicely.  A friend of mine who is a DC comics fan couldn't stand Batman Begins, because, as he put it, "Batman isn't supposed to be that serious".  Maybe not from the comic book world, but the comic book world is designed to be lighthearted so it can be catered to kids.  When you translate that across to a more mature audience, you need to make the character that much more mature.  This is important, because the same methodology applies to Dark Knight, if not more so.Without spoiling anything, the whole deal behind Dark Knight is that Batman encounters a character who is his exact polar opposite: He's serious, yet treats things such as killing very lightly.  He has no code, no morals, no ethics...only a means to an end.  This is expressed throughout the movie, as the Joker goes to any length to get what he wants.  During the movie this is believed to be a simple crime, but it eventually turns out to be a total twist - proving a point to Batman and in the doing, making Batman violate some of his moral code in order to stop him.  All of this is done very well; in fact, it's clear that the very happy-happy ending of Batman Begins was not appealing to someone in the writer's office, because this one never gets happy-happy.  Some of it is downright depressing, which I suppose is the intent of the movie.What the movie does right: Christian Bale does a good job of playing Bruce Wayne and Batman respectively.  Bruce Wayne is not involved in this movie nearly as much as the first one and in fact, feels like an afterthought.  There's a lot more focus on Batman this time around, which is as it should be.  Heath Ledger, who I doubt you've not heard about, plays the Joker extremely well.  What some people claim is an inaccurate portrayal, again, is simply a rendition of the comic book character changed to a more mature setting, and it comes across well.  Joker knows exactly what he's doing, but just does not feel remorse for any of it.  He doesn't stick himself into a funnel with some moral code; he does what needs to be done, and understands that in order to stop him, everyone, even the most ethical, would do the same thing when pushed to that limit.  Aaron Eckhart, who some might recognize from "The Core", enters into the story as Harvey Dent, a prosecutor who relies on chance (evident by Dent's frequent flipping of a two-headed coin) to get through his profession.  All of the other actors play their parts decently well, but Ledger stands out above the rest, followed shortly by (in my opinion) Bale, and then Eckhart.  I know Christopher Nolan would have you believe that Eckhart is the shining star, but his performance was marred by a part that effectively was not done properly (more on that in the next section).What the movie does WRONG: It's all subjective, but there was quite a bit I didn't care for.  First, Batman Begins did a great job at telling a story that was easy to follow along with.  Dark Knight attempted to continue this story by introducing a darker side of Gotham, but in the process did way too much in too short a time.  I don't like when movies attempt to rush what they're doing, or throw too much into the 2 hour slot, and that's exactly what Dark Knight did.  In effect, it was two different movies overlapping one another.  First, there was the Joker storyline - the center of the movie.  This was done well for the most part.  Then, you had the Two-Face substory, which they treated as an offshoot of the Joker storyline.  In the end it seemed like a good idea, but was horribly implemented - the Two-Face substory should have been a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between Wayne and Dent really is.  They had significantly more history than Wayne and Joker.  It ended up being about 20 minutes total of Two-Face action, which I found unacceptable, seeing the reason Two-Face even came into existence according to the movie.  The ending wasn't too great either.My next complaint had to do with Scarecrow, played again by Cillian Murphy.  There was some association with Joker which was never fully explained, but what really bothered me was the fact that it felt like he was just thrown in without any rhyme or reason.  First it seems like he's trying to help Batman, then it seems like he's trying to help Joker.  On top of all of this it's never explained how he got out of Arkham Asylum in the first place.  Then he's just dismissed without a second glance.  Made no sense to have him in the movie.Finally, there were a lot of things going on that also were not fully explained or justified.  I can't say anything without spoiling, but suffice it to say, some characters died who didn't really die, some characters got arrested who weren't really arrested, some people get shot but not hurt, some people got stabbed but not hurt, some people just disappeared without a trace.  At the end of the day, some of the things just didn't make any sense.  Like I said, it felt like they were trying to do too much at once instead of just breaking this apart into two movies - which I can tell they could have done and ended up with two pretty good movies instead of one good one.I still recommend the movie; but it's not for everyone.  Those who were fans of the more story driven Batman Begins might be a little disappointed.  Action and CGI junkies will fall over themselves on this movie; there's a lot going on at almost all times.

This little computer is excellent! I purchased it to use primarily in the coffee shops. It's great! I've used it to type several essay assignments for college while sitting in the coffee shop. The wireless connection works very well! I believe that this is the future of personal computing. It's so compact that I can carry it in the same carrying case as a softcover book. The Linux software is very easy to use as well as Open Office. Plus, the memory cards make file storage a breeze. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a highly portable computer.

Looks well made. Looks well designed. But when you use it, it will pull often, and when it does, it hurts. I tried two of these (this and a cheaper Panasonic), both were the same. I've gone back to Wahl, which don't pull ever in my experience. Your mileage may vary.

OMG What a terrible product from such a highly recommended company!  Every salesperson, every knowledgeable friend said Linksys (Cisco) was the best.  If that's the case, they really dropped the ball on this model (WRT160N V2).It comes with a nice user-friendly set up CD, which I found out later was a waste of time because it didn't save my customizations; I still had to go into the massive configuration program to enter the same settings.  LELA?  EasyAdvisor??  Forget it; that program worked only when it felt like it.  Half the time it didn't even start; when it did and I managed to make necessary changes (important ones still sent me into that massive config program), it would just hang while refreshing...but it was pretty to look at while I waited.I managed to get internet connectivity running for only a short while.  Then it became unreliable, then it went out altogether.  So naturally everyone assumed it was one faulty product.  I exchanged it, got an internet connectivity on the replacement but it failed not even five minutes into using it.  There isn't enough space for me to list all the different things I did to troubleshoot or the settings I was told to try, and I don't even remember how many times I reset, rebooted and power cycled everything.  I did get a stabler internet connection by using my own ideas on configuration settings but could never get file and printer sharing working on my own.  To sum it up, after 5 chat sessions and 3 calls to tech support, I got "call Microsoft".The tech support was absolutely terrible.  One person didn't know basic networking concepts like file and printer sharing, another didn't understand hexadecimal digits, a couple of techs kept asking me the same questions over and over again, I had to ask a question repeatedly and never got an answer.... Oh yeah, the reason I had 3 calls to tech support instead of just 1 is because I was hung up on twice, and no one bothered trying to reconnect with me.This has been such a terrible experience, I am returning this router and I'm not even going to replace it.  I'm going back to sneaker net!

First impression: Holy cow! this looks just like Quicken 2006...Second Impression: Performance S_U_C_K_S on an Intel-based iMac.  Sure enough, a quick check reveals that it is still a PowerPC binary. C'mon guys, can't you get with the picture?  The product still lags WAY behind the Windows version, but you could at least make one that doesn't have to run in emulation.  I could buy VMware Fusion, a copy of Windows XP, and Quicken for Windows if I wanted that -- I'd end up with more functionality and probably better speed as well.If this thing dies when I run budgeting tasks like every release of the 2006 version, I'm going through the roof!

This blender comes with a whisk, chopper, and a measuring/mixing cup. The overall design and build quality of the hand blender is pretty impressive. It doesn't feel flimsy or 'plasticy'. You also have to remember it's basically an immersion blender.  Don't buy this expecting to just wave this thing around some fruits and have everything magically puree into a smoothie.It does speed up preparation time once you get a hang on how the hand blender/wand works.  The whisk and chopper allows the Cuisinart to expand it's role in the kitchen.

I've had it with Quicken. From its bizarre copy protection schemes to the endless promotions of its own products within the program and some of the dumbest programming decisions around, such as downloading all transactions from a single financial institution into one account, even though you have separated them into multiple accounts. I don't need Quicken making these decisions for me.  The endless selling is intrusive and annoying. You have to be very careful that you aren't initiating some process that won't end up having you cancel it later.  Quicken's help file is ridiculous. It is incomplete or in many instances uses terms that are different than those used in the program itself. All too often the sketchy help file entries refer you to an equally poorly written and uninformative web entry - where Intuit attempts to sell you more of their products and services.  Because they were first to market and did a passable job in their early years, Quicken dominates the market. But, in my opinion, for the past several years, Intuit has abused its own customer base. I'm tired of it, tired of the endless marketing promotions in the programs, tired of the lousy help, tired of the ridiculous inflexibility of the program. I'll be looking elsewhere in the future and leave these moneygrubbers behind.Jerry

I have two long-haired kittens and I just don't know what I'd do without the Furminator!  Recommended to me by a friend, I bought it here on Amazon and have been using it ever since.  I am truly amazed at how much hair it removes without scratching my cats skin - one of my kittens that hated the regular cat brush tolerates the Furminator just fine.  It's particularly useful on their very bushy tails and I've had a couple of brushing sessions where I had almost as much hair removed as you see in the ads.Don't listen to any of the claims that it cuts your pet's hair - I can assure you it doesn't.  If it did, it would always remove hair which it does not do since eventually no more is brushed out.  My only difficulty using the Furminator is that you must remove the hair after every stroke so that it does not end up back on your pet.  Since many pets are quite squirmy during brushing it can be a challenge to remove the hair (especially when there's a lot of static) and not let your pet get too far away.I can't speak for its effectiveness on dogs, but as a cat caretaker I can definitely advise you to go out and get one!!

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

An interesting little camera. It is small, about the size of a small remote control, has a fixed internal memory and recharges its internal battery only through a USB port.The video quality is okay, but not great. My Canon A720 IS shoots MUCH better video, and more of it, depending on the memory card used. This camera is limited to only the internal memory, and records 60 minutes at 640x480, 30 fps in MPEG-4, (assuming the battery lasts). That should be pretty good video, depending on the flavor of MP-4 used (part 10 or h.264 is a very good codec, but it isn't stated that this uses h.264). The only place any such information is found is on the bottom of the box in very small print.The camera has software built in to copy video to a  computer (Windows XP, Vista, or Mac OS X only). Manipulating it from there on is not well documented, and the software has to be loaded from the camera to your computer - not a good thing. There was very little documentation included, which is not acceptable for the price. Granted, this is a video camera for people for people who don't want to be bothered learning any details about the gadgets they use, but a true gadget lover wants to know things that just aren't included.  Their website is Flash only, and the most recent edition of Firefox couldn't load any useful information - another major strike against them.I found the camera easy to use, but extremely limited. It has to be recharged by USB port, so you can never get far from another device (most likely a computer) to recharge the camera. You cannot expand or swap the memory or change the video quality, so it is pretty much a niche camera for keeping around the office or home to point and shoot odd little bits of video here and there, or for short trips away from a USB charger.I can't see $180 for a camera with such limited capabilities. Personally, I would much rather deal with the larger A720 IS, and be able to shoot 8 megapixel stills as well as great video, have removable SD memory cards, and use AA size batteries, all for only $20 more. The difference in flexibility and usefulness for that $20 is pretty amazing, and casts a pretty big shadow over the Flip. The small size is about the only strong point (if you happen to think smaller is better), but with the need for USB power and limited memory, it would not be a good camera to carry around even though it is small enough to fit easily into a shirt pocket.Also, the build quality is not great. The camera looks great, but the pop-out USB jack is kind of flimsy and oriented so the weight of the whole camera hangs off at an angle. You will probably want a USB extension cable. It just doesn't seem very well thought out. The buttons and "touch points" that operate the camera are pretty sensitive, and are easily bumped by accident when the camera is on. It is not comfortable to hold, and the beefy metal tripod mount seems way out of place on a little camera like this.If your video shooting desires fit in with its limited functions, this camera might be useful, but it seems to me it is just an expensive, limited function toy. It comes in a very nice flip (aha!) top box with a soft cloth carry bag (all nicely coordinated by the marketing team). Would that as much thought had gone into the design/use of the actual camera as was spent on the packaging/marketing concept.

I will be brief.The good part - compact, sleek, very portable and quite easy to work with.The bad part - VERY VERY VERY primitive software that overwrites your sensitive data without warning leading to loss of important files in a way that they can't be recovered!!If you are trying to synchronize your computer and the drive, and if you have created new files on computer that now should be copied over to the drive, Passport software starts overwriting files on your computer!!! I lost several GBs of sensitive emails, almost an years worth of communication that was extremely important. My coworkers started reporting similar experience and collectively we decided our corporate cannot afford the sloppy Passport software.Final Take: Buy at your own risk

I love this series. I really enjoyed the first season and the second just got better. As an avid reader of historical fiction, this movie was an eye-treat. I know it is not accurate but I didn't care because the story is gripping and the actors are first class. Not to mention the AMAZING setting and LUSH wardrobe. I can't rave enough about this series. It got me so intrigued by Tudor England that I found myself opening encyclopedias and reading about it to know more. I wish they made more movies like this.I heartily recommend it and envy those who are about to enjoy it for the first time.

Fast startup, convenient icon dock with firefox, gmail, youtube, and open office applications. The great thing is that the Open office word is supported and can be read by Microsoft office. Internet browsing is very fast. Connectivity is strong and the windows can be put at full screen, so the 7 inches looks a little bigger. Everything is custimizable from the dock, desktop, and displayed icons. Popular websites like ebay,craigslist,yahoo, youtube,google are all set as easy access links. About 10 games like tetris and solitaire. The webcam is amazing! good quality. You can record videos and take pictures. You can make the vid negatice, black and wide, flip it, and add cool effects. Youtube videos are overall pretty good quality, depending on what your watching. Battery lasts forever. Extremely portable at less than 2 pounds and really tiny. All my friends and family love it. So do I. Best buy this year.

I have returned no less than 4 of these under warranty.  Every single replacement unit I've received has been DOA.  What good does the 5-year warranty do if Seagate won't send me a replacement that works?  I have given up on trying to get a replacement that actually works.  I spent over $30 on postage for warranty returns.  I ended up taking apart the most recent one they sent and put the hard drive in a case I bought on ebay for $12 and it worked fine.  There seems to be some major power management issues with the enclosures.  I will probably never buy a Seagate product again.  From now on, I will stick with what has worked for me in the past (Western Digital).

I just started Juicing and didn't want to spend a lot on my first juicer.  You can spend a lot of money on a juicer.  For the price this juicer can't be beat.

Well that's not a problem with this one.  Takes about 2 minutes.EASY TO USEI was a little overwhelmed with the juicer at first but set up was easy and I was juicing in no time.  Now the hardest part is figuring out what to juice but there are books for that.  One nice thing is that the Breville manual includes recipes for using the pulp.  I thought that was kind of cool.

This is an excellent camera, it fulfills all my needs, I'd have really appreciated a few more options but I can't really complain.(I wanted to be able to mount the camera upside down or sideways and would have liked a feature to flip the video so that the resulting pictures were always the correct orientation when played back... but the feature is not there... ah well), I'd also have liked a 'stop frame' mode, take a shot every 10 seconds and pull them together as a movie...Other than these 'missing' features the camera is excellent, the small size, the ruggedness, the battery life, the video clarity, the image stabilization, and the low light behavior are all excellent (you will notice graininess at low light but all cameras do this and this is not the worst by any means)My only gripe is that the video standard used in the resulting movie files is not very widely used yet so finding programs that can edit the video is difficult or expensive.

The Oral B EB417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places, reaching back teeth, removing plaque, has a nice gum massage action, and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed. The two heads work twice as good as one, but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head. Using it by gently guiding it over your teeth, and letting it do all the work, it will last a long time too. It was nearly three months before I had to replace mine. Most Oral B brushes are interchangeable with all Oral B units. This one though, according to the buying info here, may not be used with the Cross Action brush. It will also indicate when it's time for replacement by the fading colors of the bristles.(the box shows as good picture of new and used). Just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes a long way too!It's a 5 star product, but unless you are just one person who just wants to try it out, the better buy would be to purchase the three pack. It's almost like getting one free. My pack also came with different color rings, that fit on the brush at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart. It's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well.Keep Smiling....Lauriemore good stuff:Tom's of Maine - Anticavity Baking Soda Peppermint, 6 oz toothpasteAveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion Twin Set - Total: 36 oz (18 oz X 2)Dove Pro-Age Shampoo, 12 fl oz (355 ml) (Pack of 3)

If you want to spend good money on frustration, then this router is for you. It resets its SSID frequently and Cisco hasn't provided a firmware update in over 2 years. If you call linksys support you get to hear someone read you a script in broken English. Calling it Junk is being kind.

I have two, one works perfectly and the other is buggy, hence the 50/50.The bad one needs unplugged/replugged as it appears to lose power and all associated connections, wired/wireless.  It may go a day, week or hours, but it is a consistent PAIN.You get what you pay for...and don't even think about installing this for somebody else unless you want to be THEIR tech support when the inevitable issues occur.

My wife bought the HV30 for my birthday. I eagerly unpacked it, charged the battery, reviewed the instructions, setup the camera and fired away at my little pug scratching herself on the bed. I played it back in hi def on my TV, great picture and then the camera totally locked up with the red light on in all positions including off! I couldn't eject the tape, lens cover was stuck open, zippo.Left it overnight, battery was drained, plugged it in and it magically worked again! Charged up the battery again and took a likely Academy Award winning video of a Dunkin Donuts coffee cup on my kitchen counter. The camera again locked up so it is now on it's way back to the Amazon with the tape of my pug and the Academy Award winning Dunkin Donuts cup still stuck in the camera. Requested full credit, don't want another one.Bye Bye!

This book didn't have the same flow as the previous three and although good in it's own right it wasn't good for the series. After book three I SO wanted Bella to end up with Jake, for he was the guy that truly made her laugh and smile and gave her true happiness; he was her soul mate while Edward was more of an obsession - and a toxic one at that. Jake was also closer to Bella's age (I always considered Edward a bit of a letch, for while he was 17 physically, he was actually 100 ..... ewwww!) Instead the book has Bella & Edward marrying right away and instead of a love story and a consummation of passions we get shades of Rosemary's baby. (Ewww again). I have to say that this book broke the charm of the series for me, for it cannot be unread. Call me disappointed. PS.. In fairness the end of the book was summed up nicely and imaginatively, just not the way I'd hoped.

I have two big dogs and I was afraid that this would have to be refilled everyday however, it has a very large capacity.  My dogs haven't drank out of the toilet since we got this fountain!!!  I am very happy with it.  Only problem is when they drink after they eat so food particles get to the very bottom, but I read someone else's review about using a clean fish net to get it out and it works great!!  This is definitely a must have!!!

I like the movie, but they need to fire the person who designed the packaging. I get going green, but what's the point of a package that doesn't close? I had to cut the smaller carton out of the larger one. Just stick it in a sleeve like they did with An Inconvenient Truth. Just out of principle, I wouldn't have bought it had I known the packaging is uselsss for protection/storage.

This is unquestionably my favorite Disney movie of all time. Great music, great story, humor, this movie has it all. Snatch it up before it is no longer available!The DVD features on this edition of The Little Mermaid are wonderful! The deleted scenes are roughly animated, but are delightful. Each is introduced by the co-writers/co-directors, and the missing scenes even provide you with information about the story never before known (did you know that the Ursula is King Triton's SISTER?!) The making of featurrette is a 45-minute extraveganza that goes into all the details you ever wanted to know about the development, creation, and even ramifications of the film. And did you know that Disney at one time was developing a Little Mermaid theme park attraction ride? This DVD allows you to not only learn about the ride and it's development, but also to take a virtual ride on the attraction itself - as it would have been if it had ever been realized. The 10-minute Disneypedia is in my opinion the most valuable feature on the entire DVD (besides the film itself, of course). It combines animation with live footage of undersea creatures. It is especially wonderful for children because it not only entertains, it EDUCATES! And that is the most wonderful thing of all!This is a gem of a DVD... Don't miss it!

I bought one of these as a present to myself, it was the christmas present from HELL!  First, I am an IT professional with 20 yeas of experience so I know what I am doing.The one I ordered from Amazon worked great for about 20 hours, then quit receiving wireless traffic until it was powered off and back on.  This seems to be a known problem from all the reviews and forum posts I have read since buying this product.LINKSYS technical support was just awful, the foreign techs didn't know anything about the product or networking.  I had several two just hang up on me, the tech support experience was enough by itself to not buy this product.  This is becoming a major problem with a lot of companies that offshore their tech support to India.After seven calls with tech support, they finally gave me an approval for an RMA.  I had the RMA replacement shipped to me keeping the original one until I recieved it ( had to put it on my charge card and the price they wanted for it was $20 over the going rate).When I got the second unit, it was worse than the first.  It would only support connection speeds of 12-14 Mbps and had tremendous trasmission errors.  Tested it for three days against the original purchase, neither was worth my time and trouble.  I shipped them both back and probably won't buy linksys products anymore.  I used to buy all linksys stuff but after this experience it is time to look at other companies.I've had a Belkin wireless router configured as an access point for several days now and have not had any issues with it.  It was cheaper, had more functions, and is capable of 802.11n.Save your money, read more bad reviews on this product here and chose wisely.  I still have at least four or five more calls I am anticipating to get credited properly and I am out shipping costs for the returns and several hours each I day I had the product.

I am delighted with this product.  It is unobtrusive and exeptionally quiet.  It is necessary to virtually put ones ear onto the unit before the slightest sound is heard. The storage space is more than I can possibly use and I store hundreds of high quality photos. It also does automatic daily backups of all my other work.

I have 2 of these routers and both are junk. One the AP keeps failing if more than 2 wireless devices are connected too it, it causes the router to reboot. Contacted support for replacement and after 30-45 minute wait for support they had me reset it twice. and it still failed. They finally told me it was my laptop's that caused the problem. Funny because my laptops work everywhere else. The other after 3 months of working the AP log read  kernel: WLAN: MLME - Disconnecting (deauth) wireless client: ffffffffffff Reason 3 and that was the end of my use of any dlink product. I have use dlink for years and there products have worked great, I will no longer use there products. I am an outsource IT provider and I will no longer recommed or install any of there products. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP.D-Link DIR-615 4-Port 10/100 Mbps Wireless N Router

If you wish to create a beach, this product works great.  It is far easier to buy litter that clumps, remove the cover (which confined the space and works well if you have a very small cat) and scoop out the clumps yourself.  This device is terrific at scattering litter through the rolling action over a wider surface that the cat does alone.  Surfs up!

I bought this flash drive as a replacement for my 2-gig SanDisk Cruzer that decided to stop working (every file transfered to that drive for the past 6 months has been corrupted) and couldn't be happier. This 4-gig Kingston drive is MUCH faster than the SanDisk, and I love the sliding USB connector (no cap to loose). It didn't come with a lanyard, but there is a spot to add one if you like; mine just goes in my pocket. Overall, this drive is exactly what I was looking for and would recommend it to anyone.

I am constantly playing the MMORPG , City of Heroes / Villians! &I do not like hunching over keyboards to play, so was looking at getting myself the seemingly popular  N52  , but- I am "extremely picky" about colors / asthetics and therefore 'had' to get the  Saitek PZ31A Since (on default setting) it has the similar lovely "blue" glow to match my computer, speakers, keyboard and trackball, - all blue all the time- LOL.I had it custom set up and playing within 15 minutes of opening the box, and so far so good, (just got it) I have a strong feeling that this will make my game experience much more comfortable, and another plus, is that my speed/ movement/ skill will also improve slightly! I also have rather large hands , and it fits great, and the thumbstick is so much better than trying to press "WASD" for me. I have my attack chains programmed in just the right way, and have even made fewer mistakes already. Greatest gift I got myself lately!!!

This is my review after buying this fresh incarnation. I have the fifth generation iPod. Did not acquire the 6th gen because I feel that that update last year was not much of an upgrade. Now, this offers no major improvement as well, but I still bought it for the following reasons:1) At 120 GB and 249 USD, it still offers a good USD over gigabyte value. Good as an extra external harddisk for my other hobby: photography. 2) Im planning to buy the new in-ear iPod earphone with controls that might not be backward compatible with my 5th gen. Although I wasnt able to test this in-canal two-drivered, tweetered earphone (not in the stores yet), Im betting that Apple tweaked and appropriately consulted with expert sound engineers. Im still a believer in Apple's meticulousness in sound. I wont forget that iPod offered best mp3 sound (you would think it's coming from an audio-discman) in its first launch. The one with controls is in demo, control 'pad' is very thin and convenient, sounds about the same,  3) the battery of my 5th gen is now performing to just about 60% of its original capacity4) I like the new black color, it's not black black, but approaching charcoal. A rugged color to me that doesnt 'get dirty' easily. 5) Ive been wanting the song search function since my library is now 3000+. (why didnt Apple apply a firmware for this for the 5th gen?) 6) Substantial battery improvement as well. 7) There's a considerable reduction in size. With silicon case added, it's equal to my 5th gen's size.8) Less lags  compared to my 5th gen (although fed a library of 3000+ songs plus several movies and video podcasts)Now, my objections:1) Why didn't they include the shake/shuffle function. Is it because it's hard-drive based? Do people really shakesohard to do that big damage on the hard-drive?2) There's a general impression that this iPod classic is being `left out'," for example just with upgrades that's only firmware-based. The word "classic" in itself already connotes "old," and other negative things. I hope Apple doesnt put this previous flagship down so much. In forums, there's already much comment on how "this update is not included in the classic..." are all these intentional so the iPod Touch would increase its sales? No gratitude at all to this iconic model which brings so much memory. No gratitude when it comes to business strategy? Just for me, I wont consider iPod Touch until its flash-based memory breaks 60 GB at least and price gets below 300 USD. With all the video podcasts available, 32 GB (at 400 USD at that!) is just not enough.

I am a laptop DJ, using a macbook pro with one FW800 port and Native Instruments Traktor 3.2 software for DJing.  My sound card is using the FW400 port while my midi controller is on USB port.  My local hard drive is too small for my music collection so I decided to get an external drive for my music. The Lacie drive is sleek looking, solidly constructed, and quiet (fanless).  It is working quite well for me, as I need the speed of FW800 for realtime DJing.  The bus speed of 800Mbps allows me to load tracks as quickly as possible which is important when DJing live.  While it's not quite as fast as the local drive, it is fast enough for my purposes.I bought two Lacie drives, one for playing live and the other as a backup.  I really like that Lacie put 2 FW800 ports, allowing me to daisy chain both drives together for an easy backup.  I use SilverKeeper 2.0 (freeware) as my backup software.  V2.0 is compatible with 10.3.9-10.5.x.  It is easy to use and I am quite happy with it.  I did not use any of the other software that came with the Lacie drive.I am quite pleased with my purchase.

This review contains spoilers. I'm very sorry to give this book such a low rating, because I enjoyed the previous three books, and loved The Host even more. Having greatly anticipated, then inhaled this 750-page book as quickly as I could, I was highly disappointed in the ending.There were many things that I liked about the book, especially how the Edward/Jacob issue was resolved, but I had really hoped that something in the DNA would have happened between the wolves and the vampires to completely eradicate both traits and make everyone human. (Maybe this will happen in a future book if the Jacob-Renesmee DNA combines?) It seemed that there were clues leading up to this, then the ending was anticlimactic and flat, and it was all "happily ever after" forever. There's no happily ever after if you've defeated the volturi but you know they're angry and will eventually come after you again (and they know where you live).I have a HUGE problem with the fact that while the Covens and a few of their friends are "vegetarians", they have more friends who do kill humans, whom they purposely gather to their home to witness for Renesmee to the Volturi. During the weeks they were preparing, their friends hunted many times, although they respected the Covens' wishes to stay outside of a 300-mile radius of the area so none of Bella's human friends and family would be murdered. While Bella says that thinking about this made her "uncomfortable" she was still willing to sacrifice many innocent human lives to save the life of HER daughter and HER immediate family. Any good mother I know would not willingly allow this.It also really bugged me that even after she became a mother she said several times that if Edward died she would have to die also. Again, incredibly selfish to leave your child.There were many creative and innovative aspects to this story but these moral issues really grated on me. I could see there could be room for another book in terms of the werewolf/human/vampire DNA issues but basically I can't see any moral value in being or associating with a human-killing vampire--if I were one (and we KNOW that it's possible for a vampire to be killed) and I knew I was a danger to humans, I would arrange for myself to be killed rather than harm anyone else.

I am totally blown away by the large number of negative, and really mean-sounding reviews that are here, slamming this book/DVD.  There is a medium, Esther Hicks, who is able to channel a group of non-physical beings who call themselves "Abraham", and basically Abraham's teachings are what you will find in "The Secret", ie. The Law of Attraction, only in a more physical-human orientation.I heard a seminar by Abraham, and an angry woman demanded to know: "If I'm asking, (and I AM)....and the Universe is answering (and that's YET to be seen), ....then where the hell is my STUFF?"  And Abraham pointed out to her that in her anger and frustration, she was shutting off the stream of what she wanted, and attracting more anger and frustration.A lot of the negative reviewers here sound like this woman. They are negative, attract negative experiences, and so they "tell it like it is" with more negativity. Such negative reviews don't serve you.There are a lot of people who are upbeat, and therefore attract more of that. When such people use this law, the results can be breathtaking.  If you're going to listen to anybody in life, listen to the WINNERS.  Positive people are able to make this work with very little effort.  And as for the negative people? Once they get that chip off their shoulders, it'll work for them, too, if they choose.The DVD version is a wonderful way to quickly grasp the process. I recommend it.The book version goes more into detail, and is beautifully laid out.The audio book version features the voices of Rhonda Byrne and all the teachers reading the text. It's my favorite. Rhonda reads "The Secret" lovingly and eloquently, and it's a joy to listen to!

It works well and it's easy to store and clean. I just wish it had a timer for automatic shut off. The instuction manual is not that detailed either but this product can't be found in other brands like Cuisinart which I am very loyal to. I only used it once since I bought it but it had great results. The recipe for basic plain yogurt calls for an unnecessary ingrediant - dry milk. I didn't use it and I used less yogurt culture (just a third of what was recommended) yet the result was perfect.

Sonicare makes the best electronic toothbrush. 75% of that is the brush. If you let the brush do the work, and don't press too hard, each brush will last 6 months, just in time for your dentist to really take you to the cleaners. Expensive? Not really. $25 a year for brushes isn't that much when you consider how much you'll save on a periodontist.Admitted, I've seen the brush go up in price twice in two years, so now I buy six at a time if I find them on "sale."

Pretty bad,even considering the satirical comic book is essentially unfilmable. The idea of Howard in the completely phony looking duck suit was,to say the least,a bad idea. Something animated,along the lines of Roger Rabbit,or Mr. Limpit,would have worked better,but the script is horrendous in any case.I only give this 2 stars since Lucas has done numerous movies which are even WORSE,for example,the last couple of Star Wars movies.Howard the Duck was a pretty strong signal that Lucas was just a hack.

These drives have no fan.  A proper external case should have a fan. However this makes them noisier so some manufacturers have sacrificed reliability for "quietness". That means that they heat up a great deal. This will shorten their lifespan and in some cases (as other reviews here have mentioned) the drive electronics or USB controller will burn up and fail.

My wife & I got this as a wedding gift 3 years ago. My mother had this same mixer for over 25 years. We have always thought KitchenAid was the best brand you can buy. -Wrong! maybe 20 years ago. We use this mixer at most a couple times a month for light duties. After 3 years, the PTO on the front used for the attachments quit working. I was shocked to see it only had a 1 year warranty! It is because they make them cheap now, and probably in china. Like most US appliance companies, they are riding on their reputation in the past as a quality product, but make cheap garbage these days. Be aware if you buy this unit, it is half the product it used to be.

I bought this product after I moved to a bigger place and needed a Access Point to widen the signal range. After setting it up, I realized there were a few things I wasn't aware. 1. The device must be physically connected to your existing router (so it's not totally 'wireless') to be used as Access Point. 2. If you want the device to be completely wireless, it needs to be configured as Wireless Repeater. 3. To use it as Wireless Repeater the model of the existing router you have must be WRT54G. (not WRT54GC, WRT54G2, WRT54GS, etc.) After spending hours on chatting with Linksys support (apparently she wasn't even aware some of these restrictions) we found out this device won't work with my router so I decided to return it.

Wow, what can I say, once you go HD you'll never go back. Great camcorder from an ergonomic perspective and I mirror much of what others have said but I'm going to focus on a few things others have not yet said...mainly that I'm a MacPro user and yes indeed the SW to play & edit isn't included for Mac OS but it is for Windows.  You'll have to buy something like iLife ($79.95 on Amazon) to play your video (if you bought your mac recently it has iLife on it for free) on your computer and then edit it.  How crazy is that?  Free for Win, but $80 for Mac!   The bigger issue is that I can't seem to find an answer to what I think would be part of a normal workflow.  That is, I want to simply use my Mac to archive my .mts (ACVHD) files and then bring them back (unedited) to the camera so I can view them on my HD TV via the HDMI cable.  YOU CANT DO THIS!  I spoke with Canon support and they said and I quote "We claim no compatibility with Macs WHATSOEVER" but the Pixma software included does allow you to download to WIndows, play and move it back to the camcorder".  The only way to view a clip if  you have a Mac is to burn the archived video on to DVD and then view it.  HOW CRAZY is that!?  My kids just want to occasionally view an old video now and then and what faster way than to simply copy the particular clip back to the camera temporarily to view?  NO, you have to burn a DVD!  Per Canon support "copying from a Mac is meant to be a ONE-WAY process".If you use Windows, I'd say it worth buying.  If you use a Mac, WAIT!!  Shame on Canon for not recognizing an important user base when releasing a THIRD generation ACVHD camcorder!

Got this router to replace Linksys 802.11B.  Went between this and linksys, this being $20 cheaper.  Bad choice.  Router looks nice, but is inconsistent- can sometimes get to setup screen, other times have to powercycle 3x for it to work.  Router has actually slowed down internet (even with only one device connected) by 2/3.  I get 12 mbps directly off comcast modem, and when hardwired to the netgear only get 4mbps- I can understand a small drop,but cmon!  Support is no help...standard troubleshooting from india...tells me its something on my end.  Never again will I buy netgear...go linksys

I LOVED Twilight. New Moon was good but not better. I was waiting for Eclipse and purchased it the day it came out. It was drawn out and boring. Bella has turned into a whiny,ungratful and anti marriage. I don't feel this is an appropriate message to the youth I work with. Ms. Meyer has the world at her finger tips and she left it behind in the hopes we would follow her to her next project. Feed the lions NOW for they will eat!!

Bought this switch for the jumbo frames and supposed enterprise-level durability.  I found that the switch worked well for 5 months, but one day I found all the lights blinking and it no longer worked.  I gather this isn't a rare occurrence for the product.  It did seem to get pretty hot while it was still working.  Possibly it needs more air vents.

I should have bought this years ago.    I no longer hear my husband's snores, the creaks of the floor over head, nor the traffic.  However, if I leave the room, I can hear him snoring from the other side of the door!  I've had this for about one and a half months, and have not had to ask him to go sleep in another room because he was keeping me awake!   It is small enough to take on vacation.     I also have one for my office for privacy purposes (I'm a psychotherapist.)  It has a pleasant whirring air noise, and keeps things said in my office private from those in the waiting room.    Worth every penny!

Anyone who views the new Battlestar Galactica with objective eyes would have to agree with the idea that this show far surpasses the original. This is how remakes should be made: Not slavishly copying the original, or smugly commenting on it from time and distance, but discarding the chaff and retaining the aspects that of the property that remain relevant.Admittedly, I was never a big fan of the original show. I missed the first episode way back when (it aired the weekend I went away to college), and I never really caught back up. That, plus I harbored a grudge for what Glenn Larceny (as I remember author Harlan Ellison calling him) did to Buck Rogers. But Ronald Moore and Co. have taken the concepts of the original and done an incredible job of thinking them through.The most obvious alteration is the human-appearing Cylons. While this could be considered to be done out of budgetary concerns, it serves the purpose of increasing the dramatic tension as members of the Galactica's fleet serve as Cylon moles, sometimes against their wills. Additionally, the political and spiritual connotations have been played up this time, at no expense to the action. And I would even go so far to suggest that the conflicts among the humans here, especially toward the end of the first season, are nearly as hard-fought as the battles with the Cylons.One complaint about the series that possibly has some credence is that the show is relentlessly bleak. This is arguably true. I, for one, always watch the subtitle at the beginning of each episode that counts the number of human lives remaining on Galactica and the other ships from the initial 50,000 (on the 8/5/05 episode, the count was down to 47,000 and change). While things could lighten up a little for the fleet, we need to consider that the fate of the human race is at stake here at all times. Also, I have heard complaints that, among the racial/gender switch-ups done among the characters (i.e., Starbuck/that guy from the A-Team to Starbuck/attitudinal blonde chick)that African-Americans actors have taken a hit since Boomer and Tigh are now played as an Asian woman and a drunken Caucasian man, respectively. But the greater spectrum of races and sexes on display is encouraging. Just give us a good Black regular character soon!Finally, if great effects, powerful writing, and good acting aren't good enough for the diehard Galactica fanboys, there's this: the beloved Original Apollo, Richard Hatch, has a recurring role. So the new guys respect the old school, after all.

I have used the Omega Paw for about 3 months.  I am now throwing it away.  Here is why:1)just like a traditional litter box, urine can get caught and solidified in the corners.  The Omega Paw makes this worse because it can get gummed up against the grating fins.  That means you have to take the whole thing apart. 2)The box and fins get progressively disgusting as waste builds up.3)partially dried urine gets gummed up in the track that holds the fins4)it gets points off for daring to call itself a self-cleaning litter box.   You still have to maintain it just as much as any traditional box.Pros: You can be more lazy about cleaning the thing.  Using its rolling action, you can avoid most hand-scooping.Cons: the above mentioned congealed urine in the fins problem.I tried 2 kinds of litter: Arm and Hammer (which controlled odor well, but liked to congeal) and Cat Atract (which didnt congeal as much but stank quickly).So I rank this 2 stars because I would not get it again or suggest it to someone else.

I think Ray Stevenson is a great performer and I hope this film raises some awareness on his Rome role (an outstanding series where you can see two seasons of his ability to carry a show). The film runs at 103 minutes and has a variety of short documentaries to supplement. Disc 2 is strictly the Digital Copy in SD. In watching the documentaries, the crew was making a point of high color saturation and tons of darkness. Admittedly, I only recall two daytime shots outdoors and they were both of the precinct building, so white balance had little bearing. Other settings on this did not seem to matter as much since the grain and blurring of colors appeared entrenched in some scenes, especially the church scene where they had deliberately over exposed the rainbow reflections onto the skin tones. The picture does look good as a whole, but the display never seems to get tested that often. Several outdoor night shots were obviously filmed with a different camera and make for some nice slow-mo angles.The sound of 7.1 DTS is always a welcome addition, but really it only got used in the glass grinding sequence and a couple parts of the final shootout. The music was mixed primarily to the front three channels since most was hard rock and no real score.The extras were short and slightly informative, but could have been combined into one medium piece. The gun fans will get the most out of them. Definitely not a 5 star Blu Ray, but a worthwhile addition for fans of the film.

Bought this unit in 11/07 because of the great reviews.  Worked just perfectly, then in 1/08 came back after the eggs had cooked and found the plastic top had melted into the cooker.  Had to get a screw driver to get the ruined eggs out.  Called Customer service.  They were great.  Sent me another one and asked me to return the defective one.  Got the new one and after about 4 weeks same thing happened.  Plastic top melted into the base.They are sending another out, but wow twice in a row.

First, you should know that Open Office from Sun Microsystems blows away MS Works and is absolutely free.Second, Works still has features that it can't support. For example, it has greeting card templates, but does not have features like "rotate" that are absolutely necessary if you're going to make a greeting card!In fact, Works is sadly lacking in features. It looks fancy, but its functionality is very poor.I'm just glad it came free with my computer and I didn't pay money for it.

A couple of years ago I purchased the Zoji BBCCX20 because it appeared to be highly rated.  It was the worst breadmachine I ever purchased and a waste of money.  The loaves come out uneven, higher on one end than the other, and the top of the crust is lighter and thiner than the sides and bottom. I only use this machine for making dough, then, I finish the bread in the oven.  I've written the company a couple of times and received some general information on what to change but nothing I do seems to produce a good quality loaf of bread.  Did I just get a bad machine? Maybe, but I'm certainly not going to spend the money to get another Zoji to see if a new one would be any better. I have a little machine that I bought years ago at Williams & Sonoma that makes much better bread than the Zoji.

Bought the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet on September 27, 2008 and it no longer works as of today December 27, 2008.  To only work for 3 months is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!  Just like that there is no water pressure anymore.  When the Waterpik works, there is nothing that beats it for oral hygiene but this product or any other should not be allowed to be sold if it can not work MINIMUM one year...  Amazon's return policy is only good for 30 days so now I have to deal with Waterpik directly.  There is a 2-year warranty through Waterpik...

Our cat doesn't like to be FURminated. He won't let you touch him if he doesn't want to. Based on my statement, you may think that I'm one of the people who will say that FURminator is a bad product & it doesn't work. Not true. I think this brush is one of the best on the market, unfortunately, not every cat likes to be groomed, so I had to learn a couple of tricks to make it work. I hope some of them may be useful for your feline friends. Trick #1 Try grooming your cat right after it woke up or better yet, start while it is sleeping. It will take some time for him/her to realize & react to their enemy - FURminator. I usually have at least 5 minutes before my cat starts fighting & biting. Trick #2 Give you cat some treats, place them on the floor & while he/she eats them, groom as there is not tomorrow because you usually have 2-3 minutes max :) Don't do it too often, otherwise giving treats will be associated with constant unpleasant activity for them. Trick #3 (for indoor cats) put your cat in front of the window or door, preferably where it can see some action, e.g. flying birds & and start grooming as soon as you notice that your cat puts his hunting instincts above everything else, including FURminator.It sounds like a lot of work, but it's worth it: my cat has less hairballs & everybody compliments on his black, shiny fur!

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

Loved the movie, enjoyed the extras (especially the director's commentary), hated the package. I'm fine with eco-friendly packaging, but someone got cute with this one, and there's a flap on the inner box that catches on the flap on the outer box/sleeve, which makes removing the inner box a toughie. Solution is to insert the inner box backwards, but it shouldn't have been necessary. At least they didn't have the evil seal on the thing (you know--the one that's meant to guarantee that the DVD or CD is factory new and is hard to get off completely).

You see folks, when this movie came out I was a kid so naturally being in my mid twenties now I wanted to have another look at it. I was shopping a few weeks ago and picked it up in a bargain bin at a local shopping center. I got home and watched it. It was more horrible than I remembered. I suddenly remembered that I didn't enjoy it when it came out. The duck is so annoying you want to roast him and drizzle red-wine sauce over his corpse and chow down. Lea Thompson is a pretty good actress but this is no star vehicle for her. Jeff Jones is the only good cast member and that only happens after he turns into a demon from outer space. The only sequence I liked was the one in the diner when Jeff Jones freaks out. The rest is pretty bad. Zero folks. But Amazon does not have that star system. They need to for movies like this!HOWARD THE DUCKCOST ME FIVE BUCKSAND I THOUGHTWITH A LITTLE LUCKTHAT I MIGHT ENJOYHOWARD THE DUCKTHAT DIDN'T HAPPENSO HOWARD THE DUCKFLEW FAR AWAY FROM THIS SCHMUCKWHO WASTED HIS FIVE BUCKSON HOWARD THE DUCK

It took FOUR DAYS to do a virus scan (yes, I do have 800gb of storage).  And it did find a Trojan!  Thank goodness.  But, it would not tell me which file it was in.  No way to get the filename.I bought it for backup (since they took away the fair but functional backup that came with XP).  There is no treeview checklist for backup, no way to exclude or include entire directories.  Instead you get to say things like "Financial Files".  I have files named .XYZ what does it think those are?  After I courrpted a few files I thought I would try out the restore function.  "Enter Filename".  Huh?  I want to restore a whole subdirectory, and I dont recall the fargin filenames cuz the files are gone now.  Again, no treeview checklist for restore.  But you can view the list of all files sorted by name.  Remember I have 800gb, that was a joy.This may be nice for grandma, but not for me.  Give me back the old "free" backup that came with XP and I'm happy.

All this thing is is a poorly made Dremel or Rotary Tool. Long and short, my Cuz bought one and I witnessed him tormenting his pooch with this thing.He gave up after 10 minutes of  watching and listening to his Lab shivering and growling and this thing only removed a couple of 1/16th's from one nail in that ten minutes.It is to underpowered to be of any real use. Can I just recommend the easy and professional way. Get a good Canine Nail trimmer, one made in the USA or Germany and then pick up a inexpensive rotary tool with a small drum sander tip . Cut the bulk of the nail off with the mechanical trimmer and then simply use the rotary tool to round and smooth the nails.I have English Bulldogs and have been using this system for ever. If your Dog has Black or dark colored Nails simply get a very strong mini flash light and hold it against the claw to see were the Quick is. I have used this simple technique for over eight years on two English Bulls and have only drawn Blood on two occasions and those two times were my own Mea Culpa .And if it does happen ,a dab of Styptic powder  and all is well.Just use a fine grit  and a lower speed on the rotary tool, so that very little heat will be produced and don't apply much downward pressure.Your going to find that your dogs claws have never looked and felt so smooth, no more carpet snags or scratched legs and arms.Don't fall for this companys, if you try and clip your animals claws without there wonder Gizmo , it is tantamount to torture malarkey This thing is a cheaply made rip off product that will make your Canine hate nail trimming time. As far as Felines ( yeeeeck) I cant tell you.Oh, by the way if you are looking for a good grooming tool that really works try the Furminator. Yeah I know, nothing to do with claws or there trimming !

This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)
      

I had read review after review which hailed Tropic Thunder, but shortly before seeing it, a friend who has similar taste, said she literally fell asleep during it. Two extreme points of view that had me wondering which side of the opinion aisle I was going to stand on. Consider the two stars my answer. This movie was hugely disappointing. Critics seemed to love it because it skewers Hollywood, another of those insider movies that, for me, are far more smarmy and self-congratulatory than they are funny or memorable. Mel Brooks has always done this kind of thing well but Ben Stiller is not Mel Brooks and Tropic Thunder isn't even in the same ballpark as Blazing Saddles or even Silent Movie. The problem is that they spend so much time ripping on each other in some glorious back-stabbing fest that they forget about the rest of us who neither care about studio moguls, agents, or bloated celebrities nor find them people who are interesting, at least I don't. Whether Tom Cruise plays a great studio exec or Matthew McConaughey pulls off the loyal agent to Stiller's Tugg character are considerations that have no interest to me. None of the characters is that interesting and it is hard to care about the vanities of actors or the Hollywood pecking orders therein. There are no really funny jokes, the plot is ridiculous, the gags get tired very early on, and the best part of the movie is the opening pseudo-trailers. You know a movie misses the mark when the best it can do with Jack Black is reduce him to a smack-addicted Hollywood clich going through withdrawals in the jungle. Hilarious! I'm sure Robert Downey, Jr. found much to laugh about in art imitating life, but I sure didn't. This movie is as predictable as it is dull: Stiller is an aging action hero who believes his own hype, Downey, Jr. is a method actor who spends so much time getting into other characters that he has none of his own, the gangsta rapper-turned-actor turns out to be a closeted homosexual, and the one untainted guy, the nerdy nave newbie played by Jay Baruchel is the lone touchstone the rest of us are supposed to identify with. And yet, he worships the very people who are so unappealing to me! Everyone is a phony, brown nosed, spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. Why would I care what happens to any of them? Whether this movie is accurate in how it sends-up movie making and all the boorish people involved is beside the point. I simply don't care at all about that E! garbage and watching a two-hour movie that had all the thrill of being the outsider at a work party was a huge waste of time. The only thing I do care about is my entertainment dollar and Tropic Thunder isn't worth the money I spent to watch it.

I thought this would be the perfect solution for a 59" doorway with no molding in my game room.  It was very easy to put together at the smallest width and, based on a few tests that I performed, the tension seemed good and relatively easy to work with at that width.However, when I expanded the gate to full capacity (instructions tell you that it should be at least 1/2 inch wider than doorway)the gate became very difficult to manipulate.  I don't know if it was me or if the gate was defective, but regardless of how much I adjusted the length of the top and bottom bars I could not get them even and the gate was significantly lopsided/warped.  Also, the longer I made the gate, the less flexible it became for compression to fit into the doorway.  It took about 30 minutes before I could finally get it in with a good fit - and then it was still lopsided.It was very strong when in place - my 11 month old attempted to climb it and it showed no signs of budging.  However, when I tried (again) to fix the lopsided-ness, the gate popped loose leaving indentions in the drywall where it had been mounted.  I returned this to the store the next day.

I am running Office 2003 on a XP machine and bought Office 2008 for the Mac and hoped to be able to move the Outlook information from the PC to the Mac. I found out that Microsoft has disabled functionality for exporting from Outlook that was present in earlier versions of Office, and at the same time dropped Outlook in the Mac and provided an application called Entourage. Well Entourage cannot import data from Outlook .pst files.One can upload all their contact and calendar information to Plaxo over the  Internet and put all their private information onto a server that is who knows where and who knows who will be able to access the data. Plaxo states that they actively mine the data that is uploaded to their servers. So if someone is planning to use the Mac and thinks that by buying Microsoft Office for this platform they will have an easier time porting data than if they used 3rd party apps instead they will be disappointed.

I just returned my copy of TaxCut. Good thing they have a 60 day refund policy.When I saved my returns to an Adobe PDF file (see review below about the shareware utility they use), all of the worksheets were unreadable. The width of the worksheet content seemed to be set for about half the page width, which caused page overflow. Margins at the top cut off content. Not at all usable. The IRS forms were fine, so it's not me.I'm using a wide-screen display, maybe they took the display size and scaled it. Don't know. Don't care. I have a problem and have no way to fix it. TaxCut needs to test their software better. Back to TurboTax.========== Earlier review=======================Everything was going OK until I tried to print the return to a PDF file. Without my permission or knowledge, TaxCut installed a program called "pdf995". It's used to create PDF files. If you don't print to PDF files, the software is not installed.Run the separate program, installed as Software995 in your Program list. There are ads. There are IE windows with ads - it launches IE without my permission.The add/remove programs lists it as "Pdf995 (Installed by Tax Cut)". Like that makes it OK. It's not even a licensed version, it's the shareware version. They should have just installed the driver and left the software out.This little gem is going to reinstall itself if I run TaxCut and check for updates, without me knowing about it. I'll also have to manually uninstall it after I'm done with TaxCut.To be clear, this is not spyware or a virus. The correct term is "crapware" (stuff installed without your permission that does nothing but sell you products).

Remember that time that your high school boyfriend left you and you became despondent and started doing crazy things to hallucinate his voice in your head? No? That's probably because you're a sane person with a healthy identity that is separate from your high school boyfriend's. Bella is not sane. Bella is completely out of her gourd in this book, and we get to see exactly how unhealthily obsessed with Edward she is.I know that fiction is just that: fiction. I also realize that not all characters need to be likable or even have an iota of common sense. What bothers me about the Twilight books is that Ms. Meyer has created a world in which teenage hormones run free, completely unchecked by common sense, parents, or even reality. If I had a teenage daughter who slipped past the brink of sanity over a breakup with a boy she knew less than a year, I would be trying to rectify the situation. In Bella's world, her love (which is a sacred, pure, overwhelming love, the author assures us again and again) was so important that it's okay for her to just throw her entire life down the drain once Edward leaves her. School activities? Friends? Academics? None of it's important now that she doesn't have her man by her side (not that it was really that important to begin with; who could focus on being a strong and independent woman when there's a total hunk around?).It's one think to suspend reality to prove a point or create an engaging world. However, suspending reality to let me read about a teenager who believes in soulmates is absurd.

I would like to warn those who would like to buy this collar.  I bought the collar brand new, and was warned by others about the longevity of the battery.  I wanted to prove the reviewers wrong.. but guess what, I was the one who came out as a loser.  I lost over $40 dollars on this collar.  THE REASON:  The battery didn't even last for 2 days.  The battery went dead the following day.  The battery is exclusively made by Petsafe, so you will have to buy the battery at the store, well I am not going to bother to buy another battery which will just last for a day, and costs $10 each.  I now understand why others who have bought this same collar have bought 10 batteries along with the purchase of it.  I feel so cheated and disappointed by this product.  I hope Petsafe will make changes quick to this collar.  I'd hate to say it but its basically a r i p off.

I had used the original sonicare model for 6 yrs and finally it stopped working.  I like this new model because of the small brush size head which makes it easier to get to back teeth.  Only problem is the charger seems to get a build up of scum which has to be cleaned often - even though I clean the toothbrush base before putting into the charger.

Got it on gold box flash deal so price was great. first breadmaker . as a guy instructions were glanced at and used a box mix kit. the end result was great! a loaf that was bakery quality first time. learned about "dry milk" and "breadmaker yeast" . the thing just works perfect!only semi cons are the book does not "flow" well but if you take alot of time it is ok. the lcd could use a backlight. the bread done chime is not loud enough..all in all it is very nice and would recommend to all.I will update in about 10 pounds..

Great little piece of machinery.  I use it for running, biking, and general random abuse.  Just today I washed it with my running shorts, along with my Bose earphones and it not only still works, it responds to its dock quicker than ever.  Spin cycle worthy.  Get it.

2 days after I ordered this from Amazon, they dropped the price five dollars. I called them up for a price differential credit, which was refused by 2 customer service reps and their supervisors. They said that on September 1, 2008, Amazon had eliminated their 30 day price differential credit policy. When I asked where I could find this change detailed on their site (they have had this policy since Amazon opened), they said it wasn't there.I wrote to Jeff Bezos. His assistant replied to me, and politely refused the $5 refund. I asked where the updated policy could be found, and was told that since there was no longer such a policy, no mention of it can be found on their website.I suggest you buy this product from a merchant who is both more upfront about their policies, and more concerned with customer satisfaction, which sadly at one time would have been Amazon.

I have two yappy pomeranian dogs.  The larger one periodically wears the Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar (available from Amazon for approx $45).  It works wonderfully but it's only recommended for dogs over 6 lbs.  So I bought the Lentek to control barking in the smaller dog.  I've had it for two months now and still use it, but it only works minimally.  The dogs sometimes pause a bit when it's triggered, but most of the time they just continue barking.  I guess the Lentek's better than nothing, but I wouldn't buy it again.  Instead, if your dog is over 6 lbs, I would buy the citronella collar.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      

In "Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.That moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing "Dark Knight," which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. Nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for Gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against Scarecrow and some Batman impersonators.So unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. He starts blackmailing Batman by killing Gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until Batman turns himself in.But even when captured, the Joker has an ace up his sleep -- Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives. And after a devastating loss, Batman finds himself dealing with the Joker taking all of Gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured Dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. Only Batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the Dark Knight forever.Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in "The Dark Knight" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.And Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking Batpod and the tanklike Batmobile. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor ("That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people"," Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.This is especially true whenever the Joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. And Nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on Batman. His direction is painfully delicate as he explores Wayne's sorrow and guilt.But the most striking aspect of "The Dark Knight" is Nolan's delvings into morality -- The Joker has none and Dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. It's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being TOO overwhelmingly dark.Christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding. And he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose Batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.On the flipside, the late Heath Ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign Joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could. He's pretty spine-chilling, actually -- the Joker is a true "agent of chaos," whose intent is to seize Gotham, and corrupt Batman's soul along the way. There's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast -- Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.The two-disc special edition isn't quite as special as I had hoped (deleted scenes?), but it has a serviceable bunch of extras anyway, including a digital copy of the selfsame movie, galleries for pictures, IMAX renderings of certain scenes, a bunch of mocked-up news programs from "Gotham Tonight" and a documentary about the making of the film. I smell double-dipping in this movie's future, especially since the blu-ray is reportedly far better endowed with extras."The Dark Knight" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece. Utterly astounding -- and promises better yet to come.

I got the USA-19HS thinking it would be good to support a company that releases it's products with linux drivers.  Well, what a disappointment this was, even though there is a picture of Tux on the box along with the Windows and Mac icons this model is not supported in Linux.  I emailed Keyspan support and got an auto-repsonder that said they'll get back to me within 72 hours.  It's been 4 days and still no response from them.  Luckily this thing worked pretty well in OS X so I sold it to a friend of mine and bought myself another USB serial adapter, a keyspan USA-19, which is an older model with good Linux support.  Although I replaced this purchase with another one of Keyspan's products I wouldn't support this company in the future and won't recommend them to anyone else.

The first flip I got was defective.  Something was wrong with the screen and it stopped filming after 5 short videos.  I also had a lot of trouble downloading the pictures, so I returned it, thinking it was just a bad apple.  I got a replacement and thought everything was fine because it was filming well.  However, once I tried to download the videos, again, I could not save them.  It would say save error.  Nor could I email any of the videos.  I'm very disappointed and am definitely returning the camera for good.  Its small size and ease of use were nice and convenient, but it gave me so much headache as I try to download the photos that it is just a huge disappointment.  Last night it took me all night to try to save all the photos - what a waste of my time and a frustrating experience.

I absolutely love the chi flat iron.  I have used many store bought flat irons but could not get my hair completely straight or without frizz.  The chi actually straightens my hair like they do in the salon and there is no frizz at all even if it is humid outside.  I would reccomend this item to anyone with hair like mine, curly and prone to frizz.

I have ordered an external hard drive through Amazon.com; the seller is BuyNow.  I never received the drive. BuyNOw asked me to contact FEDEX. I contacted FEDEX and they asked me to submit a claim. I submitted an online claim together with a proof of purchase.  After some time FEDEX wrote to me that as a result of an agreement between FEDEX and Ingram Micro all claims must be submitted by the later. So I called Ingram Customer Service and they told me that BuyNow has to contact Ingram to arrange for an Ingram account number and a reference/claimant number to settle this matter.  I am extremely disappointed of how much time a simple order for an external hard drive is taking and for waisting so much time for a product I don't have but I have already payed for.

I love this little computer.  We can take it anywhere.  It works great for loading and playing movies for the kids.  It boots up super fast.One thing...I bought it thinking my daughter could play Webkinz on it and stop hogging our other computer.  Webkinz requires a larger display, so it just doesn't work.Another thing...it could really use an s-video output.  I think travelers and families might get some real use from that.  It comes with vga, and it has been a real trick to connect it to our televisions.

This DVD is irresponsible in that it implies one can heal one's cancer, vision problems (even blindness) by just not focusing on the negative and thinking about the positive. While I'm all for the power of positive thinking and believe it can be helpful, it is completely irresponsible to imply that that is all one might need medically.There really is no secret and after watching this expensive DVD, I felt taken for a ride. All they are really saying is that the universe gives you what you spend the most time thinking about and it doesn't know the difference between something that might be negative and something that is positive. So, if you spend a lot of time dwelling on and thinking about the negative things that you fear, that is what you will get in life. If on the ther hand you spend a lot of time concentrating on the positive, that is what the universe will give you because you would have spent more time focusing on the positive (ie. it's all just about the power of suggestion).You do not need to spend the money on this product to learn this. The secret is that there is no 'secret'. It's all hype to try to get you to spend your hard earned money on this expensive product, which by the way they state will be an entire ongoing series.

They should have a quick guide, two-page booklet summarizing how to set the unit. I had to read the brochure twice before being able to use it.  At first I was using the single test mode and for some reason it reset by itself to the Tru-Test mode which takes 3 readings within 3 minutes span and gives you an average. I had to go back to the booklet to reset it to the single test mode.  I used to have a manual inflate bp monitor and I never had trouble with it.  This one gives too  many error messages related to the cuff.  I don't like the fact the cuff doesn't lie flat. Next time I buy something from Amazon, I am going to read the one and two star reviews instead of the 4 and 5 star ones.

Small, slim, plenty of space, fast transfer and quiet!  Works with PS3 but needs to be reformatted to FAT32 (default is NTFS).  I stream videos/DVDs off this to my PS3 and it works silky smooth.  Amazing that this runs off a single USB cable. Just wish that the case (I have the black version to match PS3) was made of metal instead of plastic. Nevertheless, highly recommended.

Maybe I'm asking too much for a $250 product, but I feel a little misled.  In addition to the MiniDVD record capability it has a flash memory where you can take video and pictures too.  The product came out this year, so I thought I could use a couple larger flash memory cards and mainly record video that route.  Once I get this, I learn it only takes 2GB cards (no SDHC).  So I buy 4 2GB cards and a 3pack of MiniDVDs, figuring I'd just use flash memory and that would be easy enough for most of my recording.  The first time I put in an SD card and see that the screen switches from 16:9 to 4:3 on me.  I discover that it only records 4:3 on SD.  And I learn that it records in MPEG4 for SD memory (versus MPEG2 on the DVDs).  I understand their MPEG4 has proprietary codecs, etc.  I tried importing video into Sony Vegas, but found it would not read the format off of the MiniDVD.  I tried re-ripping the DVD using DVD Decrypter, but that still did not work as once I dragged the video file into Vegas, I got only video (no audio).  Also, in general I found the use of the MiniDVD's on this Samsung to be not very attractive.  Like many users, I pause when recording.  When viewing the recorded DVD, each pause at the end of a segment would show as a frozen image for 2-3 seconds before moving to the next scene, which is very annoying compared to using tapes to record to.  Thanks to Amazon's generous return policy, I'm not at a loss.  Am seriously considering going the High Def route, as it seems many of those products have less problems (based on reviews here) for someone like me who wants to be able to do some editing of the video I shoot.

I bought this camera to use in our business, mainly to produce high quality videos for use on our website and some youtube videos, as well. I realize I didn't have to have HD, but the camera was rated really well, so I sprung for it. The problem with most of the reviews I read is that almost none of them talked in depth about how to edit these videos. Essentially, you can't edit them in Windows Movie Maker and many of the well known video editing software. There are a few programs you can, but the video is so choppy that you can't effectively edit it anyways. You ca use VoltaicHD to convert it to avi or wmv then use common programs, but it's coverted and worse quality, which defeats the purpose of editing hd video for high quality purposes. To me, AVCHD is only worth a darn if you have a supercomputer with an expensive software program to edit it, and even then, it's not worth the hassle at this point, to me. So, I returned it, and bought the non-hd version of the same video camera instead, which I'll be trying out tomorrow. I'll let you know on the difference.

Bought this because of the top rating in Consumer Reports.Making and pouring coffee was great.  However I sent the first one back because the clock would go berzerk after a day or two and therefore the auto brew would not come on when it should. We woke up to cold coffee that was made in the middle of the night. When the clock changed you couldn't reset it because it would go from 1:00 to 19:00 (rather that 1:00 to 12:00 AM/PM as when first plugged in), almost like a timer. We had to unplug the coffeemaker for 30 seconds to get the clock to reset only to have the same thing happen in a day or two. Sent it back for a replacement and the new one did the same thing. Maybe our kitchen TV or Laptop was causing interference because they were close to it. Either way it didn't work for us. We sent the second one back for a refund and bought another Braun, just like the one we were replacing in the first place.

I have owned the same unit for 2.5 years and love it!  At first the programming was difficult, mostly because I am not a directions reader, but once I figured it out it was smooth sailing.  I travel a lot so am often changing it from "at home" to "on the road" portions and times, so maybe that keeps me trained on how to use it.  The only problems I have had with it were my fault.  The "kids" figured out one day that they could bump into it and get food out of it.  Imagine my surprise (not really) when I realized that when you put the container on you are supposed to turn it and lock it in.  Hello!  Me not reading directions again! lol I haven't had a problem again.  I also love how my cats seem to know when its about to dump.  They will start running toward it before I even hear the intro grind to food dispensing.  When I first got it, it took about 3 days for my cat to realize what the noise was and to enjoy and not be afraid of it.  Please, if you buy this unit, read the directions, give it some time it your cat doesn't warm up to it at first, and sit back and enjoy being able to walk into the kitchen without being begged for food.  When this one finally goes kaput, I will definitely buy another!

What a mistake! I have recently purchased what I thought was an upgrade for Dragon NaturallySpeaking Preferred 9.0 by responding directly to an upgrade announcement.  What I received was a mess in the form of Dragon Preferred 10.The company shipped software with a fatal flaw. The software would not load directly from the CD. Nuance knew this, but shipped anyway. They compounded the problem by making it very difficult to find out how to make the program work. Could have included instructions, but NO! Instead offered interesting alternatives: I could pay to talk to a tech service rep or I could pay to send an e-mail. Oh, but I can only send you an e-mail if I go through multiple steps of creating "a user ID." They must be kidding! This bears no resemblance to customer service.By spending significant time on their website, I finally found the buried instructions on how to bootleg the software. In fact they had to post two alternative in case their first "fix" didn't work! If I would copy the disc to my hard drive, I could work around the error of the software writers. Unfortunately this led to a new problem: either by design or on purpose the software could not recognize that it was an up-grade. As a result it deleted all my Dragon 9.0 files as a part of the installation process... including my user files. I'm sure you can imagine how delighted I was to spend time retraining the software.Don't buy

Pampers Swaddlers are by far the best out there.  I tried the Huggies and a generic Cosco brand and neither was as good as the swaddlers.  Less blow outs with the swaddlers.

I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.   I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...    Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs, and not me!  I paid quite a bit for 2 of them, and Ineed to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?

I've read the reviews, almost all of them. Few of them seem to have anything to do with the writing, directing or production.They seem to be pointed at plots that suit a predilection. Even mine, come to think of it. My predilection being for reason and relationships.The third season reaches for thought and nobility, though the first two did also. The third season rises above producers' "war and sex", without abandoning the importance of either. The questions raised in the third season are exquisite. Painful. And important. The single thing this series does magnificently is raise questions. Even early on. I count the third season as the very best, but acknowledge my dislike of war and sexual violence (humiliation) may be biasing me.The writing has been supurb throughout.Though I also notice: Joss Whedon made us laugh at ourselves.BSG doesn't.Mulholland

5 stars for hardware, 1 for softwareI had this camcorder and a canon HV20.  The HF100 a much better camcorder in several ways that are important to me.  1) Tapeless - that means I can transfer to computer a lot faster and earlier.  2) Responsive - little time lag between press of record button and actual recording, compared to HV20.   3) Same great image quality - i can't tell much difference in quality between HF100 and HV20, even though HF100 had higher recorded resolution, and the HV20 had a larger sensor.  4) compactness.   Similar to the HV20, the HF100 had not much of a wide-angle to speak of, but the wide converter lens (which i do not have) is lighter and cheaper.The HV20 does have better battery life.   The HF100 had about 1.5 hour.  I never had to worry about battery in the HV20.   The H.264 video recorded by HF100 plays fine on a core 2 duo 2.4 GHz, but cannot keep up on a dual core 2.0 GHz AMD box -- you need relatively fast computers.  Not canon's fault though.The bundled software is unstable to a point of being unusable (on two separate XP boxes I tried). After many attempts (amid reboots, etc) I finally managed to convert one video clip to a resolution for web use, but the image quality is shameful.  I tried several software that claimed to support AVCHD without success, and eventually worked out a conversion workflow that involves storing downscaled uncompressed video, which is rather painful.

I found this product reviewed in a magazine and did some further research. I found the best price on Amazon and purchased it. It has lived up to its billing. Very handy, versatile, easy to download, and takes good footage of all the activities I want to capture on film.

This little sucker packs a punch! I just completed a Wilton Cake decorating class, and was told by the instructor not to use a hand mixer becasuse the motor would burn up. Little did she know, Kitchenaid had this awsome mixer! I have made icing, cake, cookies and dough with no problems at all. I love how easy the clean up is. Don't pass this one up, just buy it now!!!

Very good book.  Has many good ideas as most others have stated.  However, I found it falls apart in giving definitive concepts for executing projects.  He touches project execution only superficially and any related details are not well thought out.  Thus, you are left with confusion in how to handle projects.I find this especially disappointing when he defines a project as any thing we need to get done that is comprised of more than a single action step.  Wouldn't that be most of our work worlds?  I believe so.  Especially, if you have managerial responsibilities.On pages 54 and 55, he explains that "most of the time" you only need the single step (horizontal) method.  He states "Sometimes, however, you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project under control" and "every once in a while you may need to develop a more formal structure or plan..."  Those appear to be the reasons he doesn't include a way to integrate projects, with their various sequences and scopes, into his system.  To state that you MAY need to manage a project or that ONCE IN A WHILE you will need a way to plan and manage them, is to ignore reality for most people, again, especially those in management.In summary, it's still a very practical and useful book.  But, you will be left on your own to figure out a way to plan and successfully get to the envisioned outcome of a project.

The mixing feet have scraped the paint and metal off the bottom of the baking pan.  The shavings get into the bread.  Customer service said that they were sorry, but the machine was past the 1 year time frame.  They would gladly sell me a new pan for $60.00.

If you buy this product you better pray it works.  I purchased this product and it didn't work, sent it back to Amazon to get replaced.  Then it still didn't work.You might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it wasn't, and that this is the 2nd 'faulty' switch.  However they have failed to send me an RMA number to send it back to them.  I have called every day for the past 2 weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'RMA confirmation email'.As of right now their tech support/customer service 800 number isn't even working or is overloaded.If you buy this product, I hope it works for you.  But if you think you might need some service from the company, you may want to think about going to a competitor (are there any in this price range?).

These diapers are the worst! I thought after all of the great reviews that these would be great. They leak terribly!! I mean a paper towel would hold more liquid than these! I ended up going with cloth diapers in the end but before I switched I tried these and was extremely dissappointed - I bought a case of them and ended up giving away 2 packs. What a waste of money. I had to change the baby every 30 min to an hour or he would be soaked clothes and all. I used what I had opened but to be "green" they caused more landfill material because you have to use 3 times more diapers than even cheap store brands. The only thing I did like abt these was the chlorine free and loved the color of the diapers but cloth Indian cotton is the way to go - cheaper in the long run and hold a lot more liquid!

Just as another reviewer has commented, there is a problem here for Mac users. MacBook Pro laptops have  USB ports on each side. I have successfully used an older silver IOMEGA external drive for almost a year -- thanks to the cable that came with that drive. The cable has the two USB plugs on long extensions, which allow you to plug in both on either side of the machine. But this hard drive arrived with a stupid USB cable that has the two USB plugs closely tied together. Upshot is that MacBook Pro users cannot use the cable. When I called IOMEGA concerning this, they first told me they would send me to tech support for $25. No, I don't think so. Then, I told them that my older IOMEGA drive worked fine. Why couldn't I simply get another cable like that one?The response I got was that they didn't have any more cables like that. (Personally I don't think this is true.) The customer support person told me that I  would have to go purchase a USB adapter. (These run about $20)Bottomline? Don't buy this drive if you own a laptop that has USB ports on each side of the machine. The cable won't work that comes with the drive, and I think it's crappy that IOMEGA then tells me, "Oh, we can't help you. Go buy a USB adapter."Gave them a second chance with my silver drive. But there is no excuse for this. Bye bye Iomega.

This is a great invention! I registered for the one in blue and ended up going back to the store to get another one in white to use when I'm washing the blue one. It's must less hassle than the receiving blankets. It keeps the  baby warm without having loose blankets around to worry about. My son likes to have his arms out when he sleeps. So if he's resisting me wrapping him all up I just wrap him just below his armpits so his arms are free. Then his whole body is still wrapped up and warm. I would recommend getting one or two of these for your newborn. This along with that sleeping sack type thing are the best for newborns since loose blankets with have you worried about SIDS. This keeps the blanket totally confined. I would recommend this!!

Next to the iPhone, the iPod touch is one of the greatest handheld devices ever conceived. I wouldn't call this an MP3 or even an MP4 player, because it is so much more. The iPod touch combines a portable media player, a portable gaming device, a PDA, a net-tablet/netbook, a VOIP phone, an internet radio, an ebook reader, and even a musical instrument in to one very thin, very beautiful, and very intuitive device.As a PMP, the iPod touch is fantastic. The built-in speaker might not be of audiophile quality, but it is one of my favourite features. I am now able to listen to music while doing things that wouldn't permit me to wear my headphones, and I don't need a docking station to do so. Also, the new Apple Genius playlist compiler works very well, and I find myself using it all of the time. Video quality is top notch as well. I definitely appreciate the ability to switch between the filled-screen and uncropped modes. The iPod touch handles skipping through long parts of video without lag, which is also impressive.As a gaming device, the iPod touch has really impressed me. The processor of the iPod touch 2G is far more powerful than the PSP (though the graphics card isn't quite as good) and because the touch relies completely on its flash memory, games load in seconds compared to wasting half of your flight waiting for the dismal loading times on the PSP. The graphics are far above expectations for an iPod, and can even rival some decent PSP games. iPod touch games are also far cheaper than comparable PSP and DS games. The biggest drawback is obviously the lack of buttons, but touch games overcome that with unique methods of game input (touch, motion, sound, etc). In my opinion, the iPod touch is like a cross between a PSP, a DS, and a Wii when it comes to gaming.Additionally, the iPod touch is a good net-tablet. The internet loads quickly, and most sites work just as they would in the normal Safari browser. I have yet to come in to problems with the lack of flash/java support, as many web developers create iPod/iPhone versions of their sites to circumvent problem. I'm sure flash and java will be supported in future updates, so it's only a matter of time anyway. Typing with the onscreen keyboard really isn't as bad as many are suggesting, and auto-correction can now be turned off if you don't like it (though I think it is brilliant).Some nice PDA features are pre-loaded on to the iPod touch, and you can download many more off of the App Store for free. The calendar is one of the better mobile calendars I have used, and it is much better than the one that was first launched for iPod touch in 2007. By far though, my favourite PDA app is Mail. It works just like the Mail app in Mac OS X, and it can read Word docs, PDF files, Excel spreadsheets, Powerpoint shows, and all of the iWork equivalents. It checks your Mail periodically and will alert you to new messages (you can adjust/turn off this feature). Contacts can be entered as well, and you can add pictures for your contacts. I like how you can specify the country of the phone number by adding the country code, and it will automatically put the spaces in the correct places.Other features on the latest iPod touch include the VOIP phone functionality (free 3rd party app required), though you'll need to purchase a compatible microphone. Other free 3rd party apps add internet radio; pianos, guitars, flutes, and drums; and an ebook reader which is also capable of buying new books on the internet.I've had my iPod touch 2G for a while now, and I am still constantly impressed by its excellent functionality.And yes Apple, it is the "funnest" iPod ever.

This should have been a very simple purchase of replacement parts.  However, Braun has seen fit to redesign the screen pattern on the foil.  This provided a noticeably less close shave in combination with the new cutter block as soon as I used it.  I put the old foil back on (but kept the new cutter block), and the closeness of the shaver improved immediately.So, looks like I'm using the old foil until it gives up the ghost.

After owning a couple of Sportlines that were usually inaccurate, and reading all the reviews about the Omron, I bought it hoping it would be The One. Turns out it's sorta OK. For one thing, it's larger than I expected, about the size of a small cell phone. If you look at other Omron products in the drug store, you'll see they use the same "cabinet" for most of their medical monitors, so it was not designed as a pedometer. Some reviewers said they could pop it in their pocket and they were all set. But it's too bulky for a shirt pocket, and any pocket below the waist -- other than a coin pocket -- gives a highly exaggerated reading. It's also more vertical than horizontal, so if you clip it to your waist it looks like a cell phone, which isn't too bad unless you already have a cell phone. Just like the Sportlines, you pretty much have to put it on a "sweet spot" near the front of one hip or the other, or in the coin pocket of your pants if you happen to have one. It is more generous than the Sportlines about where you can place it on your belt. Unlike others that can fold down so you can read them without taking them off, the Omron has to be slipped out of its holder, or you have to leave it in its holder and take it off. If you get a really good grip on it, you find out the reset button is pretty sensitive, and your day's results are wiped out. So instead of having a pedometer I can live with seven days a week, I only use it on Saturdays, because it's too much to lug around on the job. I'll keep it until I get some mileage out of it, and because I'm tired of shopping. But I won't recommend it.

Initially, I was going to wait to upgrade after reading so many negative reviews.  After using it, I think it a great product and the graphics are excellent.  It took me less than 5 minutes to decipher the new toolbar and locate some functions, but after that, no problems.  I've never been on a learning curve, with an expert certification, it took me no time to learn these programs.  Overrall, I would have given MS Office Pro 2007 five (5) stars, but they failed to upgrade the toolbar in Publisher.  I did not get that.  Great improvements to Outlook-color scheme, views of contacts, etc.  The transition of upgrading from 2003 to 2007 went smoothly.  Microsoft goes above and beyond, when it comes to customer support.  It's worth the investment.

Claims.   Some more gaudy than others but all products make claims, including this Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener which made good on all its claims.  It's easy to use, effective in what it does and the outcome is a sharper knife, even the ones with serated edges, than you had before.    Around my house, we LIKE easy!    We also like quality and effectiveness which this sharpener delivers.   To be fair for potential buyers, don't expect surgical razor edges after running the blade through the simple cycles.    If you press too hard, the grinding wheels will stop, but you'll get the feel for the right pressure within a knife or two.  It definitely beats the draconian hand held sharpeners that we've all used and, if your experiences are similar to my own, have cut ourselves by accident.  (I still have a Thankgiving sharpening scar from 1977 to prove my point).   No worries on this sharpener unless you're really trying to cut yourself eh?      Anyway, it's good value for the money and makes a good gift for your family and friends.    Let your enemies use those old hand held sharpeners and save this Pro EverSharp sharpener for the good folk!

I can't explain why that is.  I only want to make it known that I cannot get into this show or seemingly any of the others on.  I know a lot of people are into it.  I tried.  It didn't happen.  I'm not sure if I felt manipulated or that the show lacked a sophisticated realism.  Maybe not.  Something is just not right.  There seemed to be a lack of emotional depth.  A superficiality.  A lack of...of...I'm at a loss.  An ambitious, hollow, vapid endeavor, like Lost or Heroes or Stargate Atlantis or Firefly.  Since X-Files and ST:TNG ended, I'm not sure there's been any sci-fi series that has touched me.  I need something that will challenge me, perhaps, and none of this stuff is doing that.  They all just seem, I don't know, dumbed down, or something. No offense.  Maybe it's an overly fashionable, trendy, commercialized quality they all have.  Icky vibes.

I think it is certainly worth buying if you already own the other three books. Might as well finish the series. If you can get away with just borrowing the book, you'd probably feel a little better after reading it, knowing that you saved money.As a serious Twilight series fan, I feel terrible for disliking this book, terrible for criticizing Meyer, but I can't like the book no matter how much I try. Twilight has had a long battle between those who prefer the relationship of Jacob/Bella (Team Jacob) and those who prefer Edward/Bella (Team Edward). Breaking Dawn was going to be the big bang, and we were all ready and waiting. However, after reading it, I can't help but think: Team Jacob never had a dying chance, and Team Jacob didn't even have a chance at a *decent* ending. Team Edward got what they wanted, but it seemed to happen tastelessly and all too perfectly. I have two words for you: convenient coincidences. This book solely thrives on convenient coincidences.The book certainly does have a few good points. The mystery of Bella's half-breed child and Bella's "shielding" gift was exciting. The relationship between Jacob and his wolf pack was heartbreaking and noble. The new point of view from Jacob was fresh. However, that is all I have to say for this book...and with it's monstrous length (over 750 pages) you would think it would be very satisfying and thorough. In my opinion, it felt rushed but full of open gaps and loopholes at the same time. Not a good combination.Fairy tales are supposed to be full of magic, good coincidences, and lovely endings. However, Breaking Dawn just seems to work out all too perfectly. Problems are solved by a simple coincidence or by simple perfection. May I list a few instances? Bella has a mutant spawn inside of her body, ready to kill her. Solution? The baby is able to talk to Edward and vice versa, and when she comes out she has super intelligence and she has the power to make everyone love her. There was a tragic love story between Edward, Bella, and Jacob. Solution? Edward and Bella have a baby together, Jacob imprints on that baby, and they get to be one big happy family. Girls might have been able to relate with Bella Swan in earlier books...but with Breaking Dawn, I can't imagine anybody who can relate to her. If you ask any girl who reads the Twilight series about Bella, there is a 90% chance that the girl will say "Oh, I LOVE Twilight, but I think Bella is actually kind of annoying. I read the series for [insert other person here, such as Edward, or Jacob, or the Cullens]. Who knew it was possible to love a series but hate the main character? I think Bella Swan needs a change in character development. Besides, who can relate to Bella Swan now, now that she has had every single desire (plus more) fulfilled so perfectly without any loss?Also, you may hear from other Twilight fans that the final scene with the Volturi was extremely disappointing. Even though I wasn't too fond of the overall story, I was looking forward to the fight. Meyer even described the vampires who came to witness for the Cullens enough for us to understand their skills and personalities. I grew to like these vampires. All for what? The Volturi turning back and running away? Wow. Perhaps she should have just cut out all the pages about the extra vampires. They weren't really needed anyway.On a final note: you will either be very satisfied with Breaking Dawn, or you will despise it. Ultimately, I think it is worth reading to know how the series ends, but that doesn't mean you'll be left with a better ending than the one in your head. And when fans are left thinking of better endings than the one the author provided...that just isn't a good thing.

This is a very nice pod brewer.  It has a large water tank, and options to change the size of cup you're using.  It has a cup setting and a mug setting, and each of these has a small, medium and large setting.  Through a little trial and error, you can find a setting that works for almost any cup or mug you have.  The machine works well with Senseo pods, but other pods seem to be a little large, like the Melitta pods.  When using these, you have to use the larger two pod holder, not a big deal, but something to be aware of.  There is an insert you can purchase that allows you to use your own coffee rather than the more expensive pods, however it didn't work in my HD7832.  It probably works well in the older models and hopefully someone will come out with one for this machine as well.In addition to coffee and tea, we also use it to heat water for hot cocoa for the kids.  We still use our 12-cup coffee maker, but this is nice if you're in a hurry and just need one or two cups fast.

I've drank coffee all my life.  Even my mother use to give me coffee with milk in my bottle when I was just a baby.  I was probably a stressed-out, high-strung, irrepressible shaky little bundle of nerves all through my child life.  I can't remember any day in my life that I haven't had any coffee in the morning, although I will say that I don't care to drink coffee throughout the day like some people do.  I'll drink my six cups of coffee only in the morning before school or work and that will be it for me for the rest of the day.  I'll know I've had enough coffee when people see me glowing in the dark when I rush out of the house early in the morning. Some mornings, I've polished off a whole pot of coffee.   I don't have to be at work till 8 AM but I still get up at around 4 AM so I can start slamming coffee.  Sometimes, I may fall asleep again in front of my first cup of coffee, but when I snap out of my drowsiness, I'll gulp that cold cup down and then rush to the kitchen to make my next cup.  I may slam about 4 or 5 more cups of coffee into me within the next half hour before I bolt out the door to start my day.  I don't know how some people can just fly out of bed and then fly out the door to get on with their day without coffee.  Of course, some people will rush out to the local Starbuck's at the corner and buy that one four dollar cup of coffee and that will be all that they need for the day.  Just one cup?  And at about four freakin' dollars a cup?  Forget that!Now listen up coffee lovers.  This Keurig coffee maker is the greatest coffee maker I have ever experienced.  It'll heat up water instantly and will having you drinking your first cup of coffee within the first minute you turn your Keurig on in the morning.  It has a built in timer so that you can set it to be ready to brew your first cup the moment you approach your coffee maker if you're someone who just can't wait a whole minute for it to be ready. I've become more patient since I bought my Keurig.  Now here's what's really unique about the Keurig coffee maker.  It brews one cup at a time.  What you buy for coffee are called K-cups.  Pre-packaged cups of various flavored coffees that you put in the machine to brew one cup of coffee.  There are hundreds of different flavors of national and international coffees (caffeinated and decaffeinated), and  various flavored teas, and cocoas that you buy in boxes and keep in a basket or their original boxes next to your Keurig machine.  When you buy your Keurig coffee maker, you will get an assortment of various flavored coffees and teas to sample to get you started with understanding the beauty of this great new coffee maker that you've brought into your home.  But, like I said, there are hundreds of other flavored coffees designed in the K-cup format for your Keurig coffee maker.  You'll get order forms and website ordering information available with your Keurig.  I've bought my Keurig at a Linen and Things department store, but there are other stores that sell the Keurig as well.  I was told that you can get one at Target, but my local Target doesn't seem to have it.  Anyway, at Linen and Things, they also carry only a couple of flavored K-cup coffees sold next to the Keurig.  Usually, I'll see some K-cups from Green Mountain who I think is directly licensed and distributed with the Keurig coffee maker.  Their K-cups sell at $9.99 per box (of 18 K-cups).  So, at that price, plus California sales tax (7.75%) that works out to about 59.8 cents per cup of coffee.  That's really not too bad but you can still get it cheaper if you shop smart.  Even when you order these K-cups on line directly with the K-cup companies, you'll still pay about 55 cents per cup PLUS the cost of shipping, which makes each cup even more expensive. I've learned that the best deal available is by buying my K-cups directly through Amazon.  There are various sources that are selling K-cups through Amazon and still charge shipping costs, but there are a few K-cup distributors that sell K-cups at the lowest price possible, plus charge NO tax or shipping fees.  Through Amazon, I see that Target sells a box of K-cups for $59.99 and that's for 108 K-cups.  Even without the cost of shipping (yet to be added), that still works out to 55 cents per cup, minimum.  So, Sorry Target, I think I'll pass.  That is not the best deal.I buy my K-cups at $20 for two boxes of 25 K-cups each. (50 K-cups for twenty bucks). With no sales tax and free shipping so that works out to just 40 cents per cup.  Just forty cents!!!   And there are many flavors available to choose from.  So YOU tell me.  Would your rather pay four dollars for a cup of coffee (like at Starbucks), or just 40 cents per cup?  Sure, your cup may be a little smaller, but you can always have another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and then another cup, and so on and so on and so on...... How about 10 cups of coffee for four bucks, instead of just one?You can also buy a special reusable K-cup filter so that you can still brew your own coffee from the can if you prefer.  This Keurig is not just limited to manufactured K-cups.  So, check it out my fellow coffee lovers. You'll love having this Keurig in your house when you have guests.  They will love having options of which flavored coffee they'd like to try, if you'll keep various flavors available.  I still like trying new coffees.  I generally like to stick to the more BOLD flavored coffees.  Call me crazy but I enjoy a mildly bitter harsh burn in my throat when I'm drinking my coffee.  "Tres Intense" (which I guess means Extra Bold) is a common term I see on the boxes of my favorite K-cup coffees.  So far, my favorite K-cup comes from Van Houtte and it's called "Eclipse Blend."  I've ordered about six boxes of it last month.  I'm down to two boxes already so I better order some more soon.I love my Keurig!  If you're a coffee connoisseur like me, you'll love this machine too.

I was desperately searching for something to brush my new cat with to try to get off the excess hair.  I am not used to the hair shedding all around my house!  My Vet actually told me about this item that sold at their clinic for $40.  I searched on Amazon and found it for almost half the price.  The product works.  My only complaint is the mess it makes because it works.  I advise to brush the pets either outside or in the garage to not make a hairy mess in the house.  But I can't complain, it's only doing it's job!

My older Braun 8595 needed $30 worth of new cutting blades and foils, so being a typical dumb male, I decided to buy a new $215 Braun 9595 instead.Well, turns out that the 9595 provides the exact same shave quality as the 8595, but is a bit noisier, with somewhat lower build quality, and with a goofier LCD display than the 8595 has.And the 9595's packaging is an embarrassment -- it reminds me of Apple's original iPod packaging, simply a terrible waste of paper and plastic.The 9595's "Pulsonic" quality claims are meaningless. Believe me, it doesn't provide any better or closer shave than its predecessor, the 8595. I was foolish to purchase it.Its only improvement seems to be a "quick clean" setting on the cleaning base -- which seems to be the normal "economical clean" without the drying cycle. Big deal!Braun really relied on its marketing department for this 9595 design, instead of its engineering department. Bad Braun!! Buy the 8595 instead, save $100!! Don't get 'suckered' by Braun's advertising.

This little laptop (netbook) does exactly everything that I was looking for.  The portability is unmatched.  There is no need for a separate laptop bag as this computer fits into almost any bag you might already be carrying with you.  The screen is extremely crisp and and makes it easy to read text.  The Linpus OS is, however, extremely limited.  The system was designed for ease of use and access to the features that the laptop was intended.  Even with the modest processor and RAM allotment, the hardware adapts well to any OS change.  I switched to a version of Ubuntu, and aside from a couple minor (and fixable) incompatibilities, my Aspire One is now a fully functional laptop.  With the upgraded OS, I was able to easily network this computer onto my home Wifi and and have access to all the files on my desktop.  This feature really eliminates the need for a lot of physical storage on the laptop itself.  The 8gb SSD is more than enough space to run any OS and store most of the files that someone would want on a device such as this.  At the time that I purchased this laptop, I also ordered a 16gb SD card for additional storage, but I rarely use it.  There have been some comments/complaints on the internet about the incessant fan noise from this computer.  I am really feeling that this problem is limited to the XP version with the HDD.  The Linpus version with the SSD is extremely quiet.  Only con:  Battery life.  2-2.5 hours is the longest amount of time this computer will run on a single charge.  Be prepared to keep it plugged in at home or work and never stray too far from an outlet.4.5/5 Stars.  For the cost, it cannot be matched.

Today I sent the latest version of Quicken to the recycling bin. I have gone back to my old version - Quicken 6 (Yes, that's 1996) by running it using Parallels software.

Don't be misled by the negative comments on some of the customer photos.  It is true that too much coffee remains in the grinder for perfection.  If you need such perfection and you have the money, go for the more expensive brands.  If you're like me, and have to compromise for cost and time constraints, go for this Capresso.  I handle the problem by this compromise:  I load the bin to half.  When it's empty, I clean it quickly.  If it's the weekend, I clean it well.  I still get a morning espresso or capp that's better than 90% of the coffee shops in my town.  I use Caffe Appassionato organic espresso beans on Amazon's timed shipments for daily use, and buy the gourmet Italian for treats.I have used this grinder daily for more than a year and have had no trouble with it.  I particularly like the easy storage of the beans so that in the morning I only have to turn a knob and wait less than a minute for perfectly ground coffee.  I noticed the difference in flavor from the steel-blade grinder immediately.  I love it.

Makes good coffee in less than a minute.I can't really find any fault in the product, but I can tell you what I think would be better.A larger water tank, we often have to fill it twice a day.  I wish I could attach a 5 gallon water bottle to it.  If such a device or add-on exists, let me know.It's programmable, meaning you can set a timer to make that first cup of coffee in the morning, but it takes less than a minute to brew, so its an unused feature.Hotter, you can set the temperature to a maximum of 192, but I like my coffee hotter than that, scalding hot.Coffee runs you about 50 cents a cup.  If you're a heavy coffee drinker, maybe think twice about this device.  The coffee is very good and comparable to coffee shops, so it could be considred a discount price.  The tea's aren't bad either, Earl Grey, hot!I purchased the reusable coffee filter, this is an ok device but I wouldn't recommend it; unless your drinking some wild blend that you can't do without, I find using this device more work than its worth.I would buy this coffee maker again.

I switched from TurboTax to TaxCut for my 2007 IRS return. It seemed much simpler than TurboTax, and now I know why. I got a letter from the IRS saying that they found errors in my return. I opened up my review produced by 2007 TaxCut and realized that they did not properly handle the stock options given to me by my company. TaxCut simply did not list them because they were already included on my W2. However, they show up on my 1099. The IRS now thinks I understated my income and I'm going to have to hire someone to fix this problem for me. Yes, I did review my tax forms prior to e-filing. My error was trusting that TaxCut would properly file my return without me having to be a tax accountant to know that there was a problem. Yes, I also paid for H&R to review my return for errors. Oops, guess that doesn't work either. Stay away!

This book is about organization. It says very little about prioritization and time-management. It contains nothing about actually *planning* or *doing* anything. The system boils down to making elaborate "what I need to do next" lists for every project you want to accomplish in your life, and to review and update these lists often. For every item on your list, either trash it, delegate it, save it for later, or just do it. It's good advice if you find yourself stuck at a roadblock or overwhelmed by a sheer number of tasks.According to the book, pretty much every project consists of an endless string of simple tasks such as "call X", "email Y", and "attend meeting with Z". Unfortunately the book barely discusses the planning required for difficult jobs that involve significantly more time and forward thinking than accomplishing the most immediate step. It's all about "go go go" and "do do do". If you have five minutes to spare, it's time to check your list for a call you could make or an email you could write. The resulting productivity strikes me as borderline manic. If you need to keep a folder of Post-It notes in a filing cabinet to deal with your spouse (as the book suggests), you've got problems.Regarding the actual text, the book is too long (only Chapters 4-9 are needed, the rest is self-referential filler), too general, and written condescendingly in an annoying office-speak lingo that will make anyone who actually *does* work for a living (ie: not management) cringe.If your path to inner bliss involves relying on your CPA to remind you when to purge your tax archives so you can free up your mind to relax with a glass of chardonnay by your koi pond at sunset, then you'll love this book.

I can remember back years ago when I was about 10 I first saw this movie while I was sick at home.  I know it seems a bit ironic (it matches the setting of the film pretty well).  This movie really moved me then, and it has left a mark that makes me still smile when I remenisce.The plot generally follows a medieval/fantasy love story, but it is masterfully integrated with touches of humor at all the right points.  Anyone with children between 7-12 should definately buy this DVD or otherwise try to get a hold of a copy of this movie.  This film is perfectly focused on kids at that age, it's humor subtly goes along with the childhood psychi.  Even adults will find themselves smiling at the interplay between the grandfather and the young sick-at-home child.  The humor only opens up the oppertunity for the true theme of eternal love to be accepted by the audience.All in all this is a memorable romp through a fantastical and touching world.  The humor allows for children of all ages (even grown-up children) to become immersed in story.  This movie also portrays a touching theme, that we can all gain something from.

I purchased this product because my dog likes to take off and play in the street.  I am always outside w/ her so I decided to opt for this particular model rather than pay hundreds of dollars for an invisible fence.  When this product works it is very effective.  I have found though, that many times I will depress either the sound or the shock buttons and nothing will happen.  The batteries are new so it is my opinion that this product chooses when it wants to work.

What a truly amazing product this is!  I want to give them the Nobel Prize or something.  Here's how Feliway changed my life (and my kitties too!).Jake and Elwood were from the same litter, and played well together for a few years.  My devious neighbor decides that it's okay to feed Jake...and then all of a sudden, Jake stops coming home (gee, wonder why)  I actually thought he might have been dead, since I hadn't seen him for months.(Both cats are outdoor, btw). When I finally did see him, I snatched him, and confined him to indoors for a while.  That's when all hell broke loose.  Jake and Elwood started hissing and fighting with each other, and I couldn't have them in the same room as each other.  Elwood freaked out over this "new" kitty, and started spraying every corner of the house... and he's neutered!  So both cats were completely unhappy.  Enter Feliway.Within 2 hours of plugging this bad boy in....Jake and Elwood were mellow with each other, and stopped hissing.  After a full day, they were sleeping with each other and spooning.  Even cleaning each other's heads!   I can't even completely explain how magical this truly is.  I love this product.  I also bought the spray to wipe down the carrier before they go to the vet.  It's also just as miraculous!

What a lame ending to an otherwise fun guilty pleasure. Some spoilers ahead (if you have somehow avoided being spoiled up to now). Just so we're clear: I don't care about the "message"--I didn't need Bella to become a better being or stronger or less boyfriend-centric (I had already given up on that)--and I was pretty much over the fact that my preferred boyfriend (the werewolf) was losing because Bella, obviously, can't live without Edward. And that's fine for what this story is.  What bothered me about this book is that it was sort of just dull. And Jacob's story had a mildly disturbing resolution. The first third of the book is Bella's romance with Edward culminating in sex (finally!). Almost nothing happens except that she gets mysteriously pregnant (which seemed to go against everything Meyer had established about how her vamp world worked but I could roll with it if it was fun). The second part of the book--the only reason this gets two stars--is from Jacob's POV. Likely because his is the only tolerable POV since he's so full of angst and confused. The resolution of his POV is super weird and odd and a little creepy. He imprints on a deeply inappropriate character (made doubly sad by the fact that he had already expressed that imprinting meant he just got to make one less choice in his life so it seemed he was deeply torn about imprinting but since the POV changes we'll never know). In the final third of the book NOTHING happens. You feel like something is going to happen--and there are even subplots involving plotting with Alice that you think are going somewhere but they don't. The entire final third of the book is to provide Bella with stunning beauty, more power than any other vampire (seemingly), a "forever" love with Edward, a tethered best friend in Jacob (whom she IMMEDIATELY and repeatedly notes has NO pull on her WHATSOEVER now that she's immortal--Hey Bella? We get it, thanks), a gorgeous daughter (with a dumb name) that will live dozens of years (at least), a family, her human family--everything. The final third just drags on and on with every character heaping random praise on Bella's beauty and power and I was so disappointed with the lack of suspense--there isn't even a fight! Just some thematic conversations about free will vs. subjugation that is never answered or deeply explored--except for the fact that so many of the characters seem to not have any will when it comes to love that you can't help but feel that love is both wonderful and oddly horrible. There's no room to breath in the love relationships characters have for each other in this book. The entire thing felt claustrophobic and tedious.Really, they couldn't have cut that J. Jenks thing? It went nowhere! TWO WHOLE CHAPTERS of nothing!

I never liked James Bond and "Quantum of Solace" just furthered my dislike of the movie series.       Compare James Bond to Jason Bourne, two out of the three "JBs" in spy movies (Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer, and James Bond). Jason Bourne does not sleep with any woman he can find, he feels his kills and does not kill for no reason, and is not a cold-hearted killer. James Bond is all of those things and more. He strikes me as a very dangerous and unkind person. Why would you want to make movies about someone like that?     I'm not disparaging the acting talents of Daniel Craig in any way, or any of the previous actors, but I think the whole premise of James Bond is flawed. That doesn't mean they're badly made movies, they're not. But they're morally irresponsible. And, in the world we have today, we don't need more of that than we already have.

I have tried every collar there is for my 2 1/2 year old Rottweiler.  She has three head collars, 2 harnesses, pinch collars, choker chains and regular nylon collars.  NOTHING works on her.  She has been through 4 months of obedience training and my husband and I have spent hours working with her and walking her daily.  We love to go hiking but, she had a bad habit of lunging at people and bikes.  Once she got worked up from seeing another hiker or biker, we could not seem to calm her back down.  She just became crazy in the head and hard to control.  It became so bad that we had to stop hiking because she scared other people and with her size, 112 pounds, it was really taking a toll on our shoulders trying to keep her under control.  She was never aggressive, not growling or biting, just lunging and hard to keep hold of.  Several times, she pulled me off my feet.  This collar has been a miracle for us.  She is a perfect little angel now.  She gets over and sits on command when a jogger or car goes by and if I sense she is going to jump, I give her the warning beep.  It only took about a week of using the "shock" before she got it and now we almost never have to use the stimulation.  The beep is all she needs now.  I must admit, the price kept me from buying it sooner but, I wish I would have got it a long time ago.  This is the solution for problem behavior.  I highly recommend this product and it has been the only thing that has worked for her.  It is so nice to have a well behaved dog.  All the training she went through made a difference too.  She had the knowledge, she just refused to obey until we had this collar.  It is worth the price.

This is my first pump-driven espresso machine, although I have had several small, steam-driven ones (they seem to last about 4 years, then quit). It is a little more complicated to use, but the result is more than worth the additional effort. I have been using it daily for about a month and a half, and I have no real complaints. I wish there were more space between the coffee holder and the deck, since I have to use a really shallow cup, but that is minor. The plentiful crema is a luxury, and the steamer works really well and quickly. If you don't want to spend hundreds (or thousands) more, but you want a pump-driven machine, I think this is a great solution.

I loved my previous Flip so much, I could not resist the impulse to buy it in HD.This camcorder could not be any easier to use.  The personalization options make this thing even cooler!The HD Mino is light, making it easy to carry around to capture important moments.  As opposed to my other camcorder, I find myself actually using the Flip.  All you have to do it flip out the USB, plug it in (works great with Mac) and you can edit away with nifty software contained on the device itself.  The software is much better than the previous generation; easy to use, lots of cool features.  The battery life is decent.  I find that I plug in the Flip frequently enough to download footage that it's rarely low on batteries.The footage looks great, even in somewhat low light, although night filming was a little more problematic.  I found the sound quality crisp.  Distortion caused by breezes was surprisingly minimal.  You will not find better video quality for the money.  The autofocus works fantastically.My only complaint is that the screen is on the small side.  I'd prefer to be able to see the benefits of the higher resolution on the device itself.   A perfect present for the holidays in my opinion.

The Omron HJ-7201ITC Pedometer is a wonderful product.  I bought one over a month ago and had to buy another one recently for my daughter.  It has helped me in my weight loss program.  I make sure I walk over 10,000 steps every day.  The wonderful thing about this pedometer is that I can track my routine daily, weekly, monthly over the computer.  I highly recommend the Omron JH-720ITC Pocket Pedometer for anyone trying to get in shape.  I've lost over 5 lbs.  Thank you Omron.

This laptop is great. It is everything I expected. Ubuntu Remix works like a dream on it! Runs like regular Ubuntu but Remix has a nice little desktop with compact icons and transparent Windows ;) that run much better than Vista. I am glad I do not have to worry about spyware and viruses on this thing like Windows. Hey, Ubuntu is making Microsoft scared. That is why they are still rolling out Windows XP on these other netbooks you see! This machine is for the advanced computer user and people who just want to surf and be productive and can live without Windows apps. There are 100s of other Linux apps. that work just like Windows apps, so don't sweat it!

I Loved this show and hated it when it didn't air on television anymore!!! Now I will NOT get into anymore TV shows because once you like a show as good as " Moonlight" they take it off air...I recommend this to anyone that likes a really good Love story...

Set it up in 5 minutes and my iBook detected the router immediately, after turning on "Airport".  Didn't need to configure ANYTHING and is too easy to use, but maybe that's because I have a MACINTOSH ;>)  Only thing is, because I DO own a Mac, there is no mention of Mac-pertinent info on Linksys' website, so if you ever need support I don't know if you'll ever get it from them.  Especially troubling is no mention of firmware upgrades for Mac users, so in that aspect buyer (Mac user) beware.  Otherwise, this thing is working fine for me at the moment and as I mentioned earlier, installation for us Mac users is painless.

We have used a number of different grills, with different features, and I have to say...I was excited about this item, until I used it. The base is not inclined, which means the grease collects on, and overflows instead of draining into the grease cup. When you open the grill the grease slides off the top plate, and drips on the counter.  The only good thing about this product, is the panini press, but NOT $129 good.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)
      

The most annoying collection of bad jokes/puns/gags ever seen on celluloid.  The humor is dry, at best, and vaguely vaudvillian.  And if Buttercup has perfect breasts, them I'm Rod Steiger.  Could someone please  let me know who decided to give Andre the Giant a speaking role?  The only  remotely redeeming scene is the Wesley/Montoya swordplay, and it too is a  bit tedious.  The fact that this movie was even released is inconceivable.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I was looking forward to New Moon, since I surprisingly enjoyed Twilight.  Meyer did a good job of moving the story along and not lagging behind in old news from the first.  Bella and Edward are still very much in love, but when Bella is attacked in Edward's own home by family members from a simple papercut, he decides if he loves her enough then he will let her go.This novel transparently follows the Romeo and Juliet saga and even points it out to you in the book.  I didn't like that.  I don't like my authors to spell out the obvious to me.  Like Romeo and Juliet, there is a love triangle.  For Bella, that special other someone is Jacob.  Even though Jacob is two years younger, he is mature beyond his years, handsome, sweet, and head-over-heels in love with her.  Unfortunately, he's also a werewolf whose mortal enemy is vampires.There is lots of action in the book.  Someone is hunting Bella.  Bella must rush to save Edmond, etc.Overall, (regardless of the obvious remarks in writing) I thought it was thoroughly enjoyable and look forward to more.

The overall functioning of this laptop is adequate.  I have to keep reminding myself that Vista and Office 2007 are not hp's fault.  Eliminating those gripes shortens this list dramatically.  But the problem remains that (compared to my venerable hp zv5000) certain aspects of the layout and hardware of this laptop are very disappointing.  Here are my specific complaints:1.  The touchpad is a piece of garbage.  You cannot adjust the scroll speed and the pointer sometimes jumps around the screen for no reason.  Also, the buttons feel like they belong on a dimestore toy -- far too much play.2.  The wireless toggle (a sliding bar) is located such that it is not protected when I close the laptop.  It often gets accidentally and unwittingly turned off when I take the computer in and out of my bag.3.  The volume control touchpad is located such that when I use the delete key with my left hand, my ring finger rests on the volume controls.  This essentially renders my laptop unusable until the computer stops turning itself up/down for about two minutes.4.  After I've shut it down, the computer will often turn itself back on when I pick it up to store it in my bag.5.  Quickplay will sometimes launch for no reason -- usually immediately following a spontaneous reboot.

I have a white Shih Tzu that came to me with tear stains all the way down into her "beard".  I tried wipes and topical liquids with no success.  The only outcome was she ran when I got close to her face.  I tried Angels Eyes supplement and by her next hair cut (about 3 weeks) her face was completely clean and stays that way with a teaspoon of product in her food each day. She's much happier now that I'm not messing with her eyes all the time and has quit flinching when I get near her face.  Good Job, Angels Eyes.

Like everyone else who complained about this product, I had it for about a year now and then suddenly I could not access any data on it.  Symptom looked like this:  The drive made a clicking sound, Windows XP could see the drive when USB is plugged in, but could not access the data on it.The chassis mechanicals were put together in an awkward manner, so it was not easy for me to take it apart.  I finally took out the hard drive from inside, installed it into my computer main chassis as a secondary hard drive.  Powered it up, and saw the XP operating system detected the new drive and did a scan on it, it then fixed a file system inconsistency error found, and then booted into Windows XP on the computer's primary drive.  The XP could then see and access this secondary drive, and looked like all my data were there.   But the plastic chassis was sort of ruined when I opened it, so I'll keep it as an additional secondary internal hard drive.  Had it been easier to take the drive out, I could have still used it as an external.  Oh well, I am just glad that I didn't lose the data.Other people who had the same symptom may want to check and see if this would rescue their data.

The cycles are 1) mixing 2) rising 3) kneading 4) rising 5)baking.Our previous breadmaker was a Panasonic, which made nice, light, well textured bread. The bread so far on the Zojirushi is heavy on the bottom of th loaf and too light on the top, indicating that cycle (3) does not knead the dough long enough. The last loaf, made today, is still not right, but is better, probably because we used a fast rising yeast. We are now trying to reprogram the cycle times. We understand that each breadmaker is different. We are trying to find the right combination for the bread recipe we want to use. Since we have not yet found the correct (for us) program, we are ubnable to rate the machine at this time.

I moved up to this router from an older D-Link router- and added a new desktop computer with Windows VISTA at the same time.  Router set up and links to four other computers was made more complex by the D-Link supplied Network Magic software.  Until I removed Network Magic I had all kinds of connection problems, printing problems and the like.  With Network Magic gone, I am very happy with the D-Link router.  I don't know if the conflicts with Network Magic were due to mixed OS- (VISTA and XP) but it just didn't work.  Buy the router, skip Network Magic.

I didn't bother to read the reviews because it just seemed like time to update from a much earlier version.  Last year they only had a "deluxe" version with complex multi-tagged displays that were almost unreadable, so a return to a basic version seemed promising.  Now I can just return it unopened.This company apparently makes its profit from corporate clients because both Quicken Deluxe and Turbotax now require a specialized vocabulary and intricate accounting skills.  That makes sense for Turbo since they want to sell personal service and mimicking TaxCut without its occasional errors would allow normal people to do their own taxes.  It probably makes sense with Quicken too since they undoubtedly charge for help.  Given Vista, it is hard to imagine Microsoft being simpler, so we may be back to the old days of paper.It's a deceptively labeled product from a haughty company, but there may be no decent alternative in this age of mature markets with minimal competition.

I've used various versions of Word and Excel for more than 15 years.  This version looks quite a bit different, especially in the menu bar.  But after a brief learning curve, the functionality is improved and I use fewer mouse clicks and keystrokes to get a menu item accomplished.Several months ago I bought a Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 which is a great product.  I mention it here because Word and Excel both have specific menu functions related to Adobe Acrobat (a fully functional version comes with the ScanSnap).  The ability to create a pdf document from within Word or Excel with two mouse clicks is probably the feature I like best about this version of Microsoft Office.

This is exactly the device I was looking for: An external terrabyte hard drive that will play all kinds of media files, including DVD files & high-def movies. This is an improved version over the previous Screenplay, in that the rear connections are better suited for home theater setups. The interface is also improved greatly in look and feel, with some new features, like a DVR/Tivo type of functionality which I have yet to try out. HD video looks amazing, although so far, I've only tried HD movie trailers downloaded from Apple's website. I haven't tried any Blu-Ray content yet as I don't have a Blu-ray drive. I also like the verticle format of the drive, which is small enough for any computer desk or entertainment stand. My only complaint so far is when you hit the "stop" button on the remote, it would be nice if it returned you back to the root level of the folder, rather than 2 folders deep. But that is a very minor complaint- not enough to take away a star. Great product!

We had succombed to the microwave craze until recent reviews on the downsides of that indulgence and decided to return to the healthier air popped popcorn option.  We do use a spray on butter to give it a little boost of flavor with a dash of salt.  Still the great product it's always been, ready instantly.

before two months were up, the wireless part gave out.  My IT guy was very surprised by that, and so am I.

Thank you Jillian!  I just did my first 20 minutes workout - level 1 of 3 level options - and I don't know if I can carry myself upstairs to bed!  Ha!  I'm even having trouble lifting my arms enough to type on the keyboard.  This is a dynamic, kick your butt into gear, workout and I KNOW I'm going to get results in no time with this DVD.  I just got back on a fitness kick late last fall after YEARS of getting fat and flabby.  I have been using a "Firm" Stability ball workout - which is great - but I wanted to try something different and I am so glad I picked Thirty Day Shred.  First, I love the fact that there are three separate levels to this workout system.  I can start with level one and move on to two and then three when I'm ready.  They don't try to jam three levels into one workout.  Jillian gives you plenty of instruction along the way to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly.  Yea - a lot of the stuff is old school, but that's part of the reason it's easy to follow, no complicated dance movements here.  I'm not training for Broadway, after all.I also love the fact I can get a dynamic workout in just 20 minutes a day.  I don't have a lot of time in my day and it's going to be so much easier to motivate myself to put the DVD in and move my butt when I know it's only 20 minutes. The intensity packed into that 20 minutes had me begging for mercy after 10 minutes! I'm going to be crying in pain tomorrow, but I'll be back at this workout tomorrow night because I know it's working.

Pomimo faktu ze pare dni temu ugryzl mnie pies i moja lewa noga przechodzi przez kolejne fazy umiarkowanego zwatpienia, spiesze dostaczyc moj komentarz do filmu Clinta Eastwooda 'Changeling' (Dvd, 2009). Film z udzialem Angeliny i Malkowicza jest oparty na prawdzie historycznej o tyle, na ile wyglada wyglada sztucznie, niczym przyslowiowa 'proteza zebowa Cioci Kloci'.  Eastwood opowiada historie matki (Angelina Jolie), ktora poszukujac zaginionego synka mocuje sie ze skorumpowanym Departamentem Policji w Los Angeles, pod koniec lat 20-tych zeszlego stulecia. Na pomoc samotnej matce przychodzi lokalny pastor (John Malkovich), wytykajacy w swoich mszalnych i radiowych kazaniach polityczne kumoterstwo miejscowych wladz. Zdziebko napieta akcja filmu oraz wprawnie dobrana garderoba, nie sa jednak w stanie zamaskowac ordynarnego braku maszyny produkujacej gaz cebulowy we lzawych zblizeniach Angeliny. Rezyser wraz z producentami filmu wydaja sie obrazac jego odbiorcow w sposob jawnie nieskrepowany, wypychajac w naszym kierunku calkiem odwodniona chale.Pogryziony.

I've heard amazing things about the Chi flat irons, so when my cheap Conair flat iron broke, I chose to spend the money on this straightener. It worked fine for a while, but after 3 months it stopped working completely. There's no warranty for the product if it's bought online, so it was a waste of money. I went to Target and bought a T-Studio Tourmaline Digital Straightener and it works better than my Chi, has temperature control, and has a 4-year warranty. The Chi definitely wasn't worth the money that I spent for the short amount of time it worked.

WOW - I just received my FURminator (small blue one for a cat) and even after brushing her with a slicker brush this morning I now have a wad of fur 6" wide and 1" thick.  Granted this is a long haired cat with a thick undercoat but I brush her 5x a week - this is just incredible.  As long as I keep brushing with long, light strokes she loves it - even on her neck. Possibly the people who have problems are brushing too hard - I can see how that would irritate the animal's skin as the teeth of the furminator are heavy and sharp - not flexible at all.   Definitely 5 stars in my book!

The corners are now stretched and have torn and I have a REALLY hard time getting the sheets on. They are still soft and feel great, but now too small!!! I wish they stayed the same size!

After my old grinder stopped running and couldn't be repaired for less than the cost of the machine, I looked for the highest rated burr grinder under $100, and this was it (with Amazon's discounted price.)  My old one was messy and loud, and this one is really quiet for a grinder.  The plastic or acrylic that the hopper and ground coffee container are made of is less prone to static electricity than my other one, which makes the machine easier to keep clean.  And the coffee tastes better!  I agree with the other reviewers that say the grounds are more even and don't get as heated during grinding, which helps preserve the flavor.  There are only a few things I would change to make this an even better product, including adding a switch mechanism that wouldn't let the machine start without the ground coffee container in place - that would prevent a terrible mess when you're in a hurry and not paying close enough attention.  I would also add an "off" switch to stop the machine if the timer was set for too long so you wouldn't have to change the grind setting to make the blades stop.

Wow, I'm so glad I didn't listen to all the one star reviews on here! I've been using Quicken on my PC forever. Love It. I switched over the a Mac recently and needed personal financial software. Of course I looked to Quicken. I could not believe all the negative reviews! Could it be true? Could Quicken really not work on my new Intuit-chip Mac?? I looked around for alternatives. Finding none I bought Quicken despite all the scary reviews. I followed the guidelines for switching my data from my PC (nothing more than making sure account names and categories were no longer than 15 characters). I backed up my old PC data, crossed my fingers, and hoped for the best. Seemless. Worked like a charm. Not a hitch. Not one. All my data transferred over. And yes, I'm able to download activity from my bank and credit card company into my accounts. The interface is very similar to the PC version and I find it quite intuitive.So if you're hesitating over using Quicken on your Mac, don't!

Using this device as an access point only.  Connected to a D-Link DGL4100 Gaming Router.  Network of 3 PCs is wired with 1 laptop, also wired.  Before setup, I read about security, WEP v. WPA/WPA2-Personal and MAC address filtering. Security concerns were the reason for the wired network.  I used the CD to auto setup, and then manually configured after logging into the address my router assigned to the Access Point via DHCP (your router will change the default ip if you have it set to do so.  It's status page should tell you the new ip).At first, I used simple WEP encryption.  Connection was quick.  Then I played with the WPA encryption.  Had problems connecting and stuck with WEP. I then disabled SSID broadcasting.  Tried again next day and realized after making changes to the AP's login page, and saving, you must EXIT the page before you can make a successful connection.  Once I figured that out, I went right to WPA2-Personal encryption (the highest level for me), and filtered by MAC address.  No problems.  Connects my Dell Latitude immediately and excellent range on the second floor as well (AP is on first floor).Very satisfied.  Only complaint is the bright blue..wish it was all black to blend in more.  I plan on mounting it high on a wall in my basement stairwell, which will be a pretty central location in my house and will keep it out of sight.

I wish I would have listened to a few of the reviews that said to save up for a better option.  This thing is REALLY bad in low lighting.  The videos I have in low lighting are very pixelated and not even worth while.  And when I say low lighting, I mean not a super sunny clear day.  If it's as dark as a lit room of your house you will not get quality shots.  I have yet to use this on a nice sunny day, but so far I'm a bit disappointed.  I couldn't imagine using it for trail riding going from light to dark.  I realize it was only $90 or so, but it's still very worth while to save up and spend an extra chunk of cash.  The only redeeming qualities of this thing is that it seems to stand up to shocks decently.

Compared to the first installment of the series, "New Moon" absolutely draaaags on for about 350+ pages before any action resembling that of its predecessor takes place.My advice? Save yourself hundreds of pages of Bella being morose & moody, and find yourself a good "Twilight" spoiler site to get the main gist of this book. It's worth skipping over--or, at the very most, skimming over 85% of the book and reading the last few chapters only.

I'm still using Quicken 2005 which I upgraded from Quicken 2002 (or something like that). I'd heard good things about Windows Quicken. After reading the reviews of both the Mac and Windows versions and the hassles of converting, I looked elsewhere. MoneyDance was recommend by one of the reviewers. I checked it out, importing the QIF file from my Quicken 2005. Lots of duplicates, etc.--the types of problems described by reviewers. And I discovered in MoneyDance that changing the category list (merging, deleting, etc) and altering account information that had been imported incorrectly required manual editing of an XML (??) file (Thank you MoneyDance for useful user forums). IBank (sold here on Amazon) looks really cool. I downloaded the demo, imported my Quicken QIF, and it looks almost flawless. One account quicken no longer displayed correctly and I couldn't figure out the problem, was accurate  in iBank--come on Quicken, you can export the data, why can't you display it. Anyway, I believe my search is over. The demo lets you import all your data but limits sessions to 15 minutes which I think is a thoughtful solution for an adequate evaluation; also a 30 day money back quarantee.

What I like about this gate:It's wooden and more attractive than many of the metal or plastic gates I've seen.It's sturdy. I have no qualms about using it at the top of my stairs.It swings in both directions and can be swung against the wall when not in use to keep it out of the way.It lifts out of the mounted brackets easily - which allows you to remove it when not in use (or when you need to move large furniture up your stairs!) Because it lifts out of the brackets, you can buy duplicate hardware and use this ONE gate in several locations around the house!Cautions:I've installed this gate 4 times. Good installation is key. Three of those times, the gate worked wonderfully! The fourth time, I was sloppy and the gate was not as secure, was harder to latch, and slipped out of the bottom bracket as others have described. Taking time to install properly is worth it. You may need to get longer screws or other wall anchors - depending on what material you will install it in.I have found this exact gate sold in pet stores, too, but it is was cheaper when marketed for children.If you use it for a dog, the wood is soft enough that quite a bit of chewing damage can be done.

I was very disappointed in this book.  After beginning to read the first 3 books, I couldn't put them down.  I would stay up late and get up early just to read more.  This book took me a couple of weeks to get through.  From page 1 to the last page I wondered why I was reading it and what a tragic summation to the other 3 books.I was very disappointed with the whole baby thing as well as her becoming a vampire.  The whole thing with Jacob and the baby bothered me because he was settling for something that was only apart of who he truly loved.  I enjoy a good fairy tale, however this was simply a fairy tale.I would recommend buying the first 3 because you will read them over and over again.  I would recommend checking this book out at the local library before making the purchase.  I hope that Hollywood is planning on making movies out of all of the books.  My only fear is that they will take this book for what it is and not change it to glamorize the characters as they usually do.  I would like to see them make this better.  First and last time I think I'll ever say that.

The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums.  In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.It really is the worst Oscars ever.

I had just thought people who said it turned into a paperweight had been doing something wrong...until it happened to me.  I'm tech savvy enough to know that this drive is DEAD. Fortunately, I had purchased two of these clunkers and will immediately get a non-Simpletech product to offload all 36gb of my music files.  Gotta backup my backup!Anyway, notice that so far, 36 people give this drive only one star.  They are not crazy.  If I had reviewed it 6 months ago, I would have given it five stars.  DANGER:  If you care about your data, do not under any circumstances purchase this product.  One day, yours too will become a useless paperweight when Windows doesn't see the drive at all.  It's not my computer, it's not my USB port, it's not my software...it's the drive.  DON'T DO IT.

If your kitchen space is limited like mine and you are looking for a versatile multitasking tool for blending and chopping look no further!We originally got our smart stick to make baby food which it handled with ease. The blender works well and is the easiest attachment to clean. Our chopper has made LOTS of hummus - its the perfect size for one can of beans. I think I've only used the whisk once, and it worked just fine.Performance wise, I'd give it 5 stars; clean up costs a star though. The blender is easy to clean, run it in some hot soapy water and rinse it off. Unfortunately The "gear" part of the chopper (which we use the most) must be hand washed between uses - the rest of the chopper is dishwasher safe though.  I have NOT experienced any of the "quality control" issues other reviewers have griped about. We've used this handy smart stick blender a couple times a week for almost 2 years and its still going strong.Bottom Line: Would I buy another one to replace it? You bet!

I never really thought about great coffee convenience, but this is it.  usually great coffee is burdened by grinding, brewing time and equipment- this is not- i wanted hotter coffee than our cuisinart and i got it- it isnt scalding but it is just right and i like hot coffee-dont let it sit for twenty minutes and expect it to be hot still, but you get the point.  Everyone i serve it to is amazed how simple and quick- i get to be the perfect host since i can get a decaf for so and so, a tea for whomever, and a strong one for uncle joe.  my husband and i share different tastes and this suits us perfectly.  a caveat- k cups/coffee not in supermarkets where i am from so on line ordering is a must- and storage is best accommodated by sacrificing a cabinet entirely (well, since i got just about every kind under the sun).  Coffee people brand and green mountain rival starbucks- which makes me very happy- so far i have not returned to starbucks brand and i pass tim hortons ( which i was starting to anyway with starbucks elevated taste buds) now cause i know i get the perfect cup at home.

Yes, I read the other reviews (and you should too) warning about the issues with leopard. I proceeded anyway since there were also claims that the firmware update fixed the issues. I've had other western digital drives in the past and they performed well and I had no complaints so I took the chance. The day I got my drive, I opened the box and it had a notice about the issue ("Attention Leopard (10.5) users").  I then followed the instructions to find the support solution referenced on the notice but I could not find it.  After getting a response from western digital support the indicated that the solution had been deleted and the firmware download removed from their website. So the short recommendation is:LEOPARD USERS: DO NOT BUY THIS UNTIL THE YOU SEE THE FIRMWARE UPDATE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD. Hopefully by then new drives will just have the right firmware at that point but at least you'd be able to update it in the event it's not.And in case you were thinking of just using it anyway, take heed for the other reviews with warnings and finally WDC support did recommend backing up the data before doing the firmware upgrade (when it becomes available). Not a particularly useful solution if this was meant to be your backup drive.How any company can deliver a product intended for use by Mac users that has significant problems with the current version (10.5, Leopard) is mind boggling.

The router needs reboot every day, which really sucks.As far I can understand from postings on the net, it seems that Linksys around november 2005 (starting with rev. 5) changed the operating system in the router from Linux to WxWorks. This was problably so they could save HW as the ram has gone from 16MB to 8MB and the flash has gone from 4 MB to 2 MB.The older revisions should be very solid, but I can only recommend AGAINST buying this new version ... If you want Linksys: get an older one if you can...Also I seriously doubt that you can get the Linux based SW to run since RAM and flash is only half of the previuos versions.

It would be better if this book didn't even exist. After I read halfway through it, I wanted to put it down and pretend like I'd never read any of it. There were some good parts and plot twists, but other parts are too strange and simply unsettling to let go. This was NOT a good way to end the series. It should've been like the seventh Harry Potter book, with a battle of good vs. evil at the end with a few casualties on the side. It wasn't. It was a cop-out.I don't regret buying the book simply because I liked the wolf parts, but everything from the middle on was unbearable. I went from being the Switzerland of the Jake-Edward debate to being fully pro-Edward and feeling sorry for Jake. Stephenie Meyer ruined him. It was like she didn't even write the last book. Good ideas were twisted and mutilated into stupid and happy-go-lucky crap. Sorry, fans of this book.If you like Twilight, buy this book used. Save yourself some money. It's worth reading and keeping as a collector's item, but I wanted to go back and mark out all the idiotic parts. That would include blacking out all but maybe twenty or thirty pages.

I bought this camera for the simple reason that it was so small and can capture video to flash memory. The packaging is rock solid and you can tell the build quality is very good. I don't have any use for taking digital pics with this unit and the reviews are correct.. It lacks in that dept but is ok if your expectations are low. This camera takes great video but the auto focus is very slow and in most cases you have to hold the camera very still to get a good video shot. Also, if your in anything less than bright sunlight you will have noisy/grainy video. The zoom feature is also very very slow but it will reach out there. One more thing worth mentioning. If you buying this camera to upload videos to you pc like me make sure you have the horsepower to play them. The files are massive and if your trying to display on a high def monitor you might need a dedicated video card with min 256MB ram. I had to send this back only because when I saw the quality of the video it could take in bright sunlight then compared it to what I got in the house with a few lights on I was really disapointed. I'm going to pay the extra cash and try the new Sony...

This was really a great movie.  Usually when I bring my son to his movies, I just hope that it is entertaining enough that I can sit through it.  This movie had me glued to the screen the whole way through, and I am actually looking forward to buying it on dvd.  The tale is of a future earth that became so trash filled and polluted that mankind has left for the stars leaving behind the mess and a trash compacting robot whose only job is to try and clean up the mess.  Though he does have a roach for a friend, Wall-e is quite lonely and a bit eccentric after all those hundreds of years by himself.  When a probe robot is sent to earth to look for signs of returning life, Wall e finds himself falling in love.  Though there is minimal dialog, the actions of the robots speak much louder.  The animators really did a phenomenal giving such expression to Wall-e's robot face.  The whole movie really shines.  The short film with the magician and the rabbit was hysterical and a great kick off to the feature.  Reminded me of the classic Bugs Bunny shorts.  This is a can't miss.

I will skip over all the good things this player has to offer (battery life, optical zoom, features, 16:9 format) and get right to the showstopper I came across: The video images are skewed, i.e. the proportions are off! Practically speaking, if you record something in 16:9 mode, the resulting video is horizontally compressed and people look squeezed and too thin. I've done a number of experiments and research and also talked to Samsung tech support and it boils down to the following design flaw: Unless you use the web and mobile mode (meant for YouTube etc.), the image format produced by the player is ALWAYS 720 x 480, regardless if you record in normal mode or 16:9. 720 x 480 equals an width/height ratio of 1.5. A 16:9 image should be a width/height ratio of 1.78 while a 4:3 image should be a ratio of 1.33. But the player always reformats and distorts images to fit the 720 x 480 format. Therefore regardless of the mode, all images are distorted and there's nothing you can do about it. Tech support confirmed this. I'm not sure why nobody else has commented on this yet, but to me this is a killer because video always looks distorted and the proportions are off. I am now returning this camcorder for this very reason.I had bought it to document the birth of my 1st son and now all I have is distorted video. Very disappointing. I ended up purchasing QuickTime Pro which offers the functionality to resize video, but the resulting quality is obviously not as good as the original should have been.Do not buy this camcorder if you cannot live with distorted images/video!

This review is from: The Princess Bride (Special Edition) (DVD)
      

I'm a big fan of fantasy films from the 1980s, and after reviewing a couple here on amazon, this particular DVD came up. "Looks a bit girly," I thought, and so did my brother when he came over and spotted it on the coffee table. But for the most part "The Princess Bride", is actually fun for both boys and girls, and for viewers of all ages.A boy (Fred Savage from "The Wonder Years") is sick in bed, so his Granpa (Peter Falk) comes to visit him. He's brought a book for them to read together called "The Princess Bride", a book that's been in the family for generations, and has always cheered the family up when they're sick. The boy is put off by the name, but decides to humour his grandpa and lets him read. His grandpa tells a tale of a peasant girl, Buttercup, (Robin Wright) who falls deeply in love with a farm boy named Westley (Cary Elwes), only to be heartbroken when he goes on a trip, apparently killed by pirates on the way. Buttercup vows never to love again, but these words don't stop the prince of Florin from taking her hand in marriage. Before the wedding, Buttercup is kidnapped by a Sicilian, then counter-kidnapped by a fear some "dread-pirate". But things are not as they appear, love that was thought to be dead is actually alive, and many an adventure and story are had, in this land full of monstrous eels, giant rats, fire-swamps, giants, six-fingered swordsmen and horrible instruments of torture.Though there is a little bit of romance and melodrama in the film, it is a fairly light hearted piece. Everyone seems to be having a lot of fun. The score, which is mostly GM-like keyboard tones, by Mark Knopfler adds to the goofiness of things, though it is a tender track when it needs to be. The sets and costumes are pretty nice too, as is the character development. There's a couple of cameo appearances in the film as well, (like Billy Crystal as a "Miracle Worker") so keep an eye out.Worth a look for fans of fantasy and of romantic comedy. Don't be put off by the title, it's a lot more than (as Fred Savage's character puts it) a "kissing story".

I was a fan of Ron Moore and David Eick's reimagining of Battlestar Galactica, from the first few moments of the 3 hour pilot, back in December 2003. Their stated goal upon commencing production of the reimagining of Glen A Larson's 70's original was '...nothing less than the reinvention of the science fiction television series. We take as a given the idea of tradtional space opera - with it's stock characters, techno double talk, bumpy headed aliens, thespian histrionics and empty heroics has run it's course and a new approach is required...'  Their aim was to introduce realism into an aggressively unrealistic genre. Well I'm here to tell you - gentle Amazon shoppers - that they have achieved just that!! If you've not seen the pilot miniseries of this new Galactica then buy it immediately, watch the 3 hour epic that begins the show then all 13 suspenseful and masterly acted episodes, then buy this Season 2.0 - the first 10 episodes from the 20 or so run of Season 2.   I am a drama purist, I admit it, so I don't believe in preaching to the initiated. Those of you reading this review who're familiar with Season 1 of the reimagined Battlestar will know of the show's high calibre production values and stellar acting from one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled on ANY drama, let alone Sci-Fi. To the uninitiated I will simply advise this: If Star Trek and it's 4 spin-off shows were your idea of 'realistic' sci-fi visions of mankind's future in space, then the new Galactica probably won't appeal to you. But if you like to think of yourself as a more cerebral viewer - who likes to be challenged and absorbed by your drama entertainment - then I can't recommend this show highly enough. It is adult entertainment - tackling real human issues in an often allegorical fashion. It's dark, sexy, edge of the seat stuff that pays (in this humble reviewer's opinion) sufficient homage to it's predecessor.  Season 2.0 Boxset contains three beautifully presented slimline dvd cases with 10 Episodes between them, continuing where Season 1 left of - culminating with Pegasus, which is a two part mid-season cliffhanger that had be gagging for more. I can't wait for Universal to release Season 2.1.  Do yourself a favour and get both Season 1 and 2.0 boxsets today. You won't regret it - I promise.

The pump started out being fairly quiet with very little vibration. After only a week of usage, the pump noise become unbearably loud and the whole unit shook from how much the pump was vibrating. My cat refused to drink from such a noisy fountain and would only drink when the fountain is unplugged. I tried taking the whole unit apart, including disassembling the pump, and cleaning the parts, but nothing worked. Also the way the water stream hit the bottom of the unit would always cause some splashing. The flying specks of water further discouraged my cat from drinking from it.Now the fountain is sitting in a cardboard box, catching dust in a corner of my room.

I recently purchased a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router and several D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapters together. The DIR-655 installed without a hitch and works well with several Linksys wireless G adapters I have. It also works with the DWA-130s but not nearly as well as I had expected. The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130s reports that they are attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this setup replaces.

I just bought this mixer after 5 years of wanting one and never being able to find one on sale.  Somehow I lucked out and stumbled upon it on Amazon last week for $250!  I couldn't pass up that deal and as you can see, it was a very shortlived one.  I probably would have chosen Red if I were paying full price, but only Licorice was on sale, and I have to say it's very pretty and looks great in my kitchen.  I don't make a lot of bread normally because I hate kneading, but this thing kneaded pizza dough for 2 large pizzas in less than a minute.  I was amazed.  I'm sure it's capable of much more, but that is all I've had time to try with it.  Anyways, this product is well worth my 5 year wait for a good deal and I can't wait to make all sorts of whole grain breads, pizzas, and pastas.  This mixer is more than worth its hefty price tag if you make large batches of things.  The motor is huge and could be heavy for some, but with the bowl raising mechanism, you can use it right under your cabinets and not worry about moving it around too much.  I'm very happy with my purchase and look forward to using it for years to come.

I replaced this keyboard with the newer G15 (orange) and found it was much better all around. This G15 was so large that the mouse pad was scrunched in the corner, also had technical problems with it after some use- certain keys stopped working randomly. Not sure if it was a driver issue or something else (using Vista) but couldn't fix it. If looking for a great gaming keyboard, go with the newer G15 instead.

So I got his about a month ago and it worked alright. There were certain songs that when played would cause the player to freeze and I'd have to restart it which was a pain. The weird thing was that only certain songs caused the player to freeze, these songs had been purchased from the online wal-mart store adn were WMA formated. go figure. So then one day I was installing a firmware upgrade and because the USB cable was so short I had to rig something on the back of my comp. for it to sit on, but unfortunately the player fell off and the cord came out mid-installing. now whenever I turnit on it instantly freezes no matter what. Im so sick of dealing with all the bugs on this system. Also i had about 1700 songs on it and going trhough them all with the little buttons was a PAIN!

Last time I purchased a Netgear product it was a solid and competent wireline router in a blue metal box. That purchase influenced me to go for WGR614. Boy times change! What I got for my money was a soapbox made from cheap plastic. The setup was a slow and on-going battle. To illustrate the point - the out-of-the-box DHCP served addresses but a client could not ping the router back!Finally I was through all this only to discover that this pile of garbage cannot hold wireless connection. It was a total disaster for me considering that I had a naive hope to use it with VPN tunnel to my office network. All prior notes from other customers on instability of wireless connection are very true (overheating seems to be very likely the cause).Therefore, I cannot recommend this equipment, however, if you are stuck with it, you can generally make it a useable product by either a) leveraging a vaunted by manufacturer small footprint in your fridge, thus preventing overheatingb) sparely use wireless only for occasional surfing, do all work which counts using wireline.What I can recommend is a Cisco product called Linksys WRT54GS. Bought it instead of WGR614. The speed booster seems a marketing trick, however, for few extra $$ you get the last dinosaur of deservedly praised v4 platform of WRT54 series. It is fully free of all malaises attributed to WRT54G, which is currently retailed in v5.Finally, if you go for broadband router product - go for brick and mortar. Amazon.com restocking charges are hefty.

Two of us went to this movie last night. It was the first show on the release day and there were only six others in the whole movie theater. However, that fact was not indicative of the movie's worth.It was a very moving, yet joyful movie, set in the backdrop of racial tensions and violence of 1964 in South Carolina. Fourteen year old Lily (Dakota Fanning) flees her abusive father along with her caregiver Rosaleen (Jennifer Hudson) who is battered for claiming her rights as a colored woman.  Lily is also fleeing from her fussy and haunting memories of accidentally shooting her mother to death, during an abusive tussle between the couple. Guided by a honey bottle label they reach the Boatwright sisters. August (Queen Latifah) the oldest among the Boatwrights welcomes the fugitives. They put them to work in the mesmerizing world of bee keeping. Lily grows in loving admiration for the maternal figure of August and learns more about her own mother and her deep love for Lily. Dakota Fanning does a superb job of portraying the abused, at the same time, assertive Lily of fourteen years. All the other cast members do justice to their roles, though Queen Latifah, as a caring maternal figure to Lily and queen of the Boatwright beehive, is less convincing.  Overall, the movie tastes sweet in the mouth, but leaves a lump in the throat.  It's sure to appeal more to female audiences. Apparently that's what the ad is calling for: "Bring your girlfriends, sisters, mothers and daughters."

we bought this gate for the top of our stairs.  The very first time my 10 month old touched it the bottom popped out.  There is not way to adjust it to fix this problem.  It is very unsafe.  We are returning it.

Hi All.So we are quite a large family with 3 kids that all want their own laptops.  What to do?  Netbooks are my answer.  I have already purchased and reviewed a Lenovo S10 with Windows 7 and now I bought this unit and upgraded it to 2gb ram with Windows 7.You may be wondering if I loved the S10 then why did I try the HP...simple...I bought it at a liquidation sale and $$$ were the only thing on my mind.  I got it for less then $400 with the 2gb upgrade.I must say that I am equally impressed with this laptop.  The 2gb upgrade was a breeze and installing windows 7 from a USB stick was also very very easy.  Please google the windows 7 via usb stick method, it will save you from having to buy a dvd/cd drive and it works perfectly via a 4gb Sandisk Cruzer.  The box comes with the laptop, the battery, and ac-adapter.  The machine comes with 1gb RAM and only has 1 slot...so if you upgrade to a 2gb SO-DIMM then you are going to lose the 1gb it includes..it gets put on the side - just in case.  :-)You may be wondering why I chose a beta operating system.  Well, my opinion is that XP is dated, Vista is a Beast, and Windows 7 is a breath of fresh air.  Yes Windows 7 is a BETA....and wont be released any time soon (or so they say)...but it has great power management features that work perfectly on a netbook.  This machine scored a whopping 3.5 out of 5.5 on the ratings panel..and I believe the low score is due to the Atom processor being 1.6.  The memory, hard drive, video, etc was all around the 5 mark....  For those that dont know...windows vista and windows 7 have a hardware rating that they give to all machines....This particular unit is for my 11 year old son in 6th grade.  He wants something that he can play online games with, do homework with, and check the schools website for study guides etc....  Simple stuff.  I have loaded Office 2007 on the system and it works without a flaw.  Speed is not an issue and sometimes I wonder if it is necessary to spend thousands of dollars on a high powered machine like I have done with my Thinkpad...  Yes the screen is 10"...that is my only issue thus far..but you can get used to it, for once you pick this thing up and say "MAN this is LITE...."  :-)  We have used Microsoft Word and Excel regularly no issues.Wireless performance is perfect...no dropouts and no issues getting connected.Windows 7 found all of the drivers for this laptop, which I must say is amazing....and really helpful.  No fiddling around with trying to find latest and greatest drivers...it just works.  Windows 7 also has great power savings features for these machines....ie the hibernation which I have never had 100% success with....well 7 makes it work.  On a netbook when you close the lid the machine hibernates...press the power and it resumes to where you left off.I can keep going on and on.....Others have complained about some proprietary HP stuff...but I have one question to all that buy a Netbook.....what are you trying to achieve?If you need a laptop that can handle all basic and some advanced functions and you dont care about having a plethora of connections (ie. more then 2 usb ports) then this machine is for you.  If you need a lot of connectors and bells and whistles...buy a full size machine.The only gripe I have..and its not major...is that the headphone and microphone are on the same jack.....which is easily overcome buy using a usb based headset...  Thats it....I hope you like my review.

From all I hear, this is a very good product.  However, I could not get it to work on my system.  I wish I could give it a good report.  My attempts to get it to work corrupted my system so badly that I had to reformat my hard drive. Rather than struggle with foreign product support, I just returned it. I am not a computer illiterate, so I am disappointed that it did not work.

I had my baby for 3 hours now and I must say it's a dream to type on, the mouse pad is good too. My Eee also booted up quickly and I was able to access the internet fast.  I scooted around many websites in a flash. The only problem I see with this little guy is that I can't watch Hulu videos without it constantly starting and stopping and my volume is very, very low.  I checked the volume on the computer and everything is set to the highest levels. I also tried to watch an instant netflix movie and it said that my connection was too slow and that I could watch it in one hour and twenty minutes. Other than not being able to watch TV or videos I think this is a great little computer and I recommend anyone looking for a netbook to seriously consider this one.

I gave this one star because Amazon does not let you give zero.Can a product be so bad I will uninstall and go back to the clunky buggy Mac Office 2004? I think so. Also, do not do what I did and let the installation program convince you to remove all prior versions: now I not only have to go back and reinstall the old program, but all updates too. 2008 was supposed to be faster and fix all the bugs from 2004. And I believed them. It fixed one print bug and added many new bugs. One delightful one: parts of text disappear in normal and  preview, but reappear when you highlight the section. It seems that the text is there, you just can't see it. Plus, print view is screwed up. They arbitrarily reassigned the locations of several menu items, usually moving to another area and then to a new submenu. LOTS of new submenus. Stunningly, they no longer found space for RECENT in the main FILE menu, Now, to find your list of recent documents, you have to do to the FIle menu, then to a new submenu for recent documents.  Oh, and it is slower than ever, Universal Binary code notwithstanding. Apart from the bugs and clunkiness, it seems that every single change they made makes the program less suitable to the way I use a word processing program. If my clients did not use MS, I would go to Mac "Pages" and never look back. I won't even comment on the problems of going back and forth between the .doc format and the new .docx format. I am sure others have addressed that joy.One amusing note. Initially they arbitrarily replaced the toolbar icon for "Save as" to a new, stupid icon with a stylized MS "O" for office. Apparently I was not the only one who hated this: one of the two (so far) massive "updates" changed the icon back to "Save as"

We purchased this upgrade because Microsoft no longer supports the version of Outlook we had on our computer and we needed to link with other software so we had to upgrade. We decided to upgrade the whole suite--big mistake. The helpful folks at Microsoft have come out with another unintuitive product that makes more things "automatic", which is very unhelpful. It has removed or hidden some features I used in the former version on a daily basis (for example, the ability to add columns in a simple table in Word--now I have to import an Excel spreadsheet instead--although I can add all sorts of more complex formulas to a Word table--that's just strange). Yet again my Big Brothers at Microsoft have decided that THEY know what I need better than I do so they will make my choices for me. By doing so, they have also made the program much slower and, surprise, sloppier. It's pretty, though--lots of new icons instead of WORDS (imagine that in a WORD PROCESSING PROGRAM!). Guess it would be great if I were ILLITERATE!

Observando el tamano, la calidad de imagen y el desempeno no queda mas que aceptar que estamos frente a un gran producto, el teclado es bastante grande y se puede utilizar con la facilidad acostumbrada en otros mucho mas grandes, la resolucion de la pantalla y su resolucion son excelentes, muy facil de acceder a redes inalambricas a traves de wifi y sincronizar mi Nokia N95 con su bluetooth, aunque algunas cosas deben ser dichas para ser objetivo... se calienta bastante en la parte inferior, (tal vez es por ser enteramente de cubiertas externas metalicas) y lo otro es el sistema operativo... Windows Vista Business... Estoy esperando un poco mas para  migrar el equipo a windows xp, pero en lineas generales les recomiendo este equipo, muy eficiente al contar con su tamano y portabilidad.

The Norelco T-980 price was not much more than the cost of replacing the battery in my 10-year old Norelco Maverick T-3000 and I was excited about the addition of a vacuum feature. Be careful what you wish for! The vacuum does its job and sink cleanup is definitely faster. But the vacuum feature tends to obscure your view of the blade edge making it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard's edge while looking in the mirror. The vacuum must be emptied by using thumb pleasure to disengage one side of a rather flimsy, curved compartment cover that swings open on a hinge that looks so weak that I'm afraid it's just a matter of time before I accidentally break either the hinge or snap the cover in half. Equally delicate-feeling are the two sliding, plastic prongs used to hold the primary blade in place. Yet it must be removed each time one wants to use the smaller, more accurate trimming blade. And of course the trimming blade uses similar prongs to hold it in place. My older T-3000 had a self-contained trimming blade that slid forward with a simple thumb push whenever needed and then retracted just as easily. The T-980 is larger around and heavier than the older unit... enough so that I really miss the sense of control and precision I was used to. In short, the T-980 feels clumsier, less maneuverable, and less accurate. It takes longer to complete the job due to the hassle of changing the regular blade and the trimming blade. And it really tries my patience having to be so careful not to beak one of those delicate, sliding, plastic prongs or the vacuum-compartment cover. I'm really tempted to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old T-3000.

I love Pixar, but everyone preaching that Wall-E is some sort of modern masterpiece is making me sick.Now the movie wasn't horrible, but come-on folks - it's nothing to tell your friends about and I certainly wouldn't watch it again.I would actually say it's one of Pixar's poorest movies yet. Poor story, poor animation, poor music. Well ok, it was a horrible story. Haven't we seen/read/watched this same story a dozen times before? Add robots and it's new, right?Reviewman says: Bargain DVD rack if you really need to buy it, got mine used for six bucks and feel I overpaid.

We took this to the Dr's office and checked it against thier automatic blood presure cuff and it is within 2 mg of the same numbers.  Even taking your own more than once on the same arm will give that difference. We are very happy with the product. It would be nice if it's face was a bit smaller and or had a 'smoother' less angular design.

Three times I have lost papers that I've worked on four HOURS...and only when I was working from the Kingston.  Suddenly in the middle of writing it would try to convert the doc into another format, resulting in a document full of gibberish.  It doesn't matter if you save, either, it just replaced the original with the new document.  The first time I thought it was a fluke, the second time I had the paper saved in another location (thank goodness) and the final time happened this morning.  So I am writing this review, trashing the Kingston, and buying something better.  Save your money.

Saitek has always made good hardware, and the X52 was no exception. I briefly owned its predecessor, the X36, years ago, but returned it when I couldn't get the drivers to work (this was under Win98, mind you), but the feel of that hefty, chunky design stuck with me. When I found out about the X52 I just had to give it another go (having already bought and been quite satisfied with a Cyborg Evo), and I was not disappointed. Since the grip on the main stick is adjustable, even my wimpy hand fits comfortably despite the sheer size of the design. Control is smooth, with perfectly tuned resistance that does not hang when centered. The throttle is adjustable; on the lowest setting it glides smoothly while on the highest it takes a fair bit of push to move. The primary and pinkie triggers are both solid metal and feel like they could take some serious abuse; the toggles on the base also feel solid. The flip cover over the primary fire button just feels awesome and is a huge improvement over the flip-down button of earlier models in this line.The programming software included with the package is extremely useful; it allows you to create separate profiles for every game you play, changing button functions and even allowing you to switch which axis is which ( very handy, since not every game recognizes them the same way; just going with default settings I found that some games would actually recognize the slider and knob controls as the rudder or roll controls and not let me change them). Since I got the X52, I haven't had to mess around rebinding key commands to joystick buttons at all, which used to be a huge annoyance when reinstalling- now all I have to do is copy over my profiles and I'm set to go.I only have a few complaints about this stick:-The C button, located on the left side of the stick, is easy to press by accident due to its position and does not feel as durable as the rest of the controls.-The drivers provided on the CD are THE ONLY ones that work for me; every time I've downloaded new drivers from the Saitek website they have screwed up everything and made necessary a complete wipe and reinstallation of the SST software.-Some older games won't recognize the stick. To be honest, I've only had this problem with a handful of games, and they're all *really* old (Win95/98 old), but the problem does exist and the SST software can't compensate for it.Nonetheless, the few issues I have had do not detract from the quality of the product or my satisfaction; this is the best of its breed and it will take something truly impressive to surpass it. Because the price is so much lower now than it was when I bought mine, I'd recommend this version of the X52 over the newer X52 Pro model- the improvements to the new design are marginal and not really worth the extra $40-$50 unless you absolutely have to be on the cutting edge.

The SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Titanium I received is a disappointing flop. The product did not easily fit in any USB port, going in only by force or accident. The thumb drive catch broke and no longer holds the case back, allowing the case to slide forward and block the USB port. Additionally, the thing constantly caused computer hang-ups. Finally, after all the above frustrations, it managed to jam itself and will not accept or download data. I would have returned it, but I may be partly at fault by becoming impatient with trying to get it into a USB port. I will continue searching for a flash drive that is better machined to fit the ports it is designed to fit.

Before purchasing the Omron HJ-112, I bought a different brand, that cost more money, at a local sporting goods store. It was a piece of junk. It often was off by 50%. I did some research and settled on the HJ-112. It's fantastic. I verify accuracy about 3 times a week by counting 200 steps and checking the pedometer. With rare exception, the pedometer counts 200 steps. When it is off, it counts 199 or 201, which probaby means that I miscounted. I highly recommend this product.

So Steve expresses that we women need to act like a lady and think like a man! Honestly, Steve didn't tell me anything that I wasn't already doing as far a having standards go. I understood Steve's point of view when he stated that the 3 things men do to show women that they really love them are to profess, provide and protect and if he doesn't have his life together he probably will not be looking for a relationship. Well I must be a man then, because this is how I think. As a woman I need to do these things as well.      To me this book was one-sided, of course because Steve is man and he speaks from a male view.  He really didn't tell ME anything I did not know, in actuality most of the things he expressed were common sense. Now maybe I'm just an alien of a woman, but for women to come out and say that this book is SOME sort of miracle of a book is plainly ridiculous.  And to speak about this 90 day rule, what about those who believe in celibacy, or those who know the repercussions there are in premarital sex...This is really the type of book that you want to give your daughters? Oh Okay, right!!     So you must give in to the man's need for sex because he lacks self-control and has to have "the cookie"? And it's odd that as a Christian, steve would condone such actions. Again I'm no judge, I'm am stating my opinions.  Okay read, there were some good points made (again not that I didn't know but for the masses maybe) and there were some blatantly wrong statements made! His chapter on the independant woman being lonely made some sense but it also lacked some sense. My theory is that a man can profess, provide, and protect a woman but he can be just as much a man in being with a strong independant woman who can do these things as well. He should know he is a man, he shouldn't need affirmations and confidence boosts from a woman to define him and make him one. Bottom line, man or woman, Know who you are and what you stand for and you'll be fine.

Because I read such great reviews of this unit I picked it over the less expensive Krups and Cuisinart burr grinders. Having spent an hour trying to set the Capresso up, I now regret my decision.First, what people say about following the directions when setting up the hopper is true. It has a cheap, thin plastic collar that will break if torqued even slightly. I know this because it broke even though I was closely following directions. For $90, the company should have made the collar more durable, especially considering the hopper will be removed and replaced often.Plus, the hopper would not fit onto the base correctly. Again, following the directions carefully I could not get it to set evenly. Maybe the burr wasn't seated correctly as some have noted. I couldn't remove the "removable" burr, so I can't say.Anything this fragile and difficult isn't worth owning. It's a piece of badly designed junk in my opinion and is being returned tomorrow.Go for something else and forget the Caprisso 560.

This USB Drive is very poorly made.  I expected more from Kingston, who I always regarded as producing a good product.  The metal USB connector, which ejects out of the main body in a clumsy, non-smooth fashion, is too easily bent up and down, opening the seems of the plastic case.  Also, the body design itself seems to be too wide for some (admittedly older) USB ports.  Overall, I expected a sturdier outer casing.  In terms of data storage, however, I have no complaints.

How can LaCie stay in business?Needless to say, this is going back.

I bought this DVD as soon as it was available, as we used the first DVD in this series "My Baby Can Talk-First Signs."  Caitlin was about 14 months when she saw the Sharing Signs DVD, and made the sign for diaper the next day after viewing the DVD.My husband thought I was nuts, trying to teach Caitlin sign language, but he is a believer now.  We showed her the first video a few times a week starting at around 9 months, and she made her first sign around 11 or 12 months.  She has not learned ALL of the signs on these videos yet.  She tends to make the signs that mean the most to her, like book, milk, diaper, baby, and hat.  It is so cute to see her sign, and she is happy when we praise her.  Right now she is labelling things rather than asking for them with signs, most of the time, but she made the sign for book the other day and headed off to her bedroom to get out her books for me to read to her.  I don't think she is making genius progress with the signs, but she is learning words, and what things are, which is really neat and will give her a leg up, I think.  Even if you are not interested in the signs, the videos show the word on the screen, say the word, show the sign, and then show lots of examples of that word.  Caitlin just loooooves to watch these videos, and an added bonus is that she will eat almost anything while they are on.  We really have enjoyed learning sign language with her, and I think it has been a useful communication tool.  We are so tickled when she does a new sign.  She is about 15 months now, and did the signs for lion and monkey for the first time today.  Yay, Caitlin !

We have been blessed with new neighbors with three large dogs.  The dogs bark at everyone who passes, including my family every time we enter our back yard.  I purchased the Petsafe PBC00-11216 in an attempt to tone this annoyance down and left it in place for three weeks.  I mounted it on a post facing their yard and noticed no reaction from the dogs.  The indicator turned on in response to the barking, but the dogs did not seem to react at all.

i just got this to use for my n64 emulator on my pc.  overall, it's a great deal.  it's not going to be nearly as nice as one that costs more (there aren't analog sticks, for example), but it works well.  the shoulder buttons (similar to the r and l buttons on a ps2 controller) feel kinda weird, but with a little experience the feeling becomes less distracting.  inexpensive controllers with analog sticks typically break more easily, so this is a great budget gamepad.  i have only had it for a few days so i cannot vouch for its long-term reliability, but as with any product, if you treat it well, it will last longer.

I'm probably going to get flayed for this but this movie wasn't great because it had no where to get greatness from. I mean Twilight was 500+ pages of glaring, staring, growling, flinching and glittering so how does that translate into a film? Poorly. People complain that it moves too fast in the movie, that Bella and Edward fall in love too quickly. It only feels like it took longer for them to fall in love with each other in the book because the book had chapters of filler to make it seem like they actually had time to build up to their "epic" love...and they didn't. I'm giving this movie 2 stars because I actually did like the baseball scene...well, up until the end when it got cheesy with the crouching standoff. The graphics could have been better. The fast running was just comical and the glitter made him look like a muppet! And was it just me or was Carlise so pale when he came on screen that someone, ANYONE in that town should have said, "Um...Doctor, are you okay?" He looked like he should have been in a bed getting a transfusion instead of treating patients. I also gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because I like Robert Pattinson. He was worth at least one star even though most of the movie he looked constipated or intense for no reason what so ever. The bad part about this is that I thought Twilight was the best book out of the series so that doesn't leave me with much hope that the rest of the movies will get any better.

I'd been searching all over town for a practical air popcorn popper, and this was the answer to my prayers.  I ordered this popper based on the rave customer reviews and they were right on -- this is definitely a keeper.  About a handful of the kernels don't pop, but overall, it's pretty effective.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  Definitely less messy than the oil popper I had.

This is unbelieveably noisy. Wow! Sounds like a leafblower. It shaves half descent but takes longer than my old Norelco. It also has a tendancy to nick. Now that I have replaced my battery in my Norelco, I am going back to it. After a month of using the Remington, I am tired of being "attacked" each morning. I'll keep it as a backup - only.

I sent this back for refund. The design was cumberson and capricous. The food pusher had to go in one way, not the other way and had a hole in the bottom so you could not use for liquids...the cutting blades did a horrible job of mushing the food rather than shredding the potatoes. Very disapointed. Bought a Black and Decker and was happy.

The scale looks nice, and yes, its got kind of a nice feature set. But mine broke after only six months. Put in new batteries, nothing happens. No problem, right? its got a 1-year warrantee! Sucker. I called the company to get some help. They were brusque and borderline rude, accusing me of not knowing how to work it. I was at work, but they said I'd need to call them from home with the scale and to go out and buy four brand new batteries and put them into the unit while they were talking with me on the phone. Hey, I know how to put batteries into a scale, okay? The kicker was that if they signed off on that part, I'd have to pay to ship the scale crosscounty and back!! By the time I did that, it would almost be the cost of a new scale. No wonder they offer a "warrantee". Some customer service. I just trashed it.All in all, a terrible experience - crappy product and crappy, weasel service.

This drive was a huge disappointment.  I bought it some months ago because it was on sale, opened it and let it sit.  The first time I tried to use it - NOTHING.  Tried to format it, and even though it shows up in Explorer as "Removable Disk", formatting fails with a "There is no disk in Drive G:" "Insert a disk and try again".  No recovery software, no fix software, no help on the Transcend web site, and a manual that appears to have been written by accident.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!

Had I not have just purchased a very fine wire hair comb for $8 from Petco I might be leaving the high feedback you see for this product also.  BUT, this $8 wire brush from Petco is actually FASTER at removing hair/fur than theis FURminator is.  So, if you have a Petco near you or another pet  store, look for brush with small, stiff, fine, closely spaced wires and you will save yourself a bundle.

I recently purchased this mini food processor to replace a 25 year old "Cuisinart Pro" that gave up the ghost after some serious use.  While, I don't know if this one will last another 25 years it does look like a smaller version of my original.  The design and manufacturing seems identical and the results are the same regardless of capacity. If I remember correctly the "Pro" cost over $200; more than four times the current price of the smaller model.I just want to add a note of advice to would be buyers of this appliance or any other food processor....What these things do well is puree ingredients into sauce bases, tapenades, soups, salsas and the like.  Don't buy one expecting to throw away the paring or chef knives.  If you are preparing large quantities of sliced vegetables you're better off with a mandolin or a good set of knives.  I've always found the attachments to be generally more trouble than they're worth.  But for a small preparation of the aforementioned foods, I don't think you can beat the Cusinart Handy Prep.

I own the 2GB version of this drive. It is tiny, but still fits nicely into a USB port, but I have noticed a serious problem. The flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in (you can see it on the bottom). I have been very careful with how I store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from USB ports. Regardless, the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top, and the bottom corners of the plastic shell (that go into a USB port) have started snapping off in little chunks.

The Twilight series has been going down hill since the 2nd book. This book is even worse than the mediocre New Moon. The plot is completely gone, and Stephanie Meyer trudges on with reused material for 300 pages and DESTROYS all believable personalities left. I had to make myself finish reading the last 200 pages of this piece of literary purge by SM and her Morman housewife fantasies.

I purchased the Seagate Desktop 500GB, USB External drive to store music and video from my Dish DVR and it is working great! Set up was easy...just plug it into the USB port on your DVR and follow the instructions. Of course, you will have to pay your one-time fee of $39.95 before you can use the external hard drive. Transferring music or video is very easy. My husband loves it! He can stop worrying about having enough space on the DVR. I'm very satisfied with the product and Amazon.com!

I cuurently use a Sanddisk Cruzer 1.0 Gb flash drive to move my Quickbooks program from home to work and back. It is a very large file - 79 Mb's with many tens of thousands of transactions. I can't tell you what the data transfer rate of the cruzer 1.0 is, but it is so slow that it makes the program impossible to use. It takes three to four seconds to record one transaction! As a workaround, I  have to download the entire file to my hard drive, do my postings, and then re-save it to the flash drive.A 256 Mb flash drive that I had earlier, and whose name I failed to make note of, worked many times faster than the Cruzer, which is why I am so sensitive to the speed.In researching to find a faster drive, I find that only Kingston and Memorex post their data transfer rates under technical data. The rest seem to think that "Modern slim design" is a technical feature.I have ordered the Kingston Data Traveler as its transfer rates are 6.0 mb read, and 3.0 mb write. I really don't know if this is fast or slow, but in the absence of all the other brands leaving out this information, I am going to assume it is fast, and hope for the best.

This movie is likely one of the most ridiculous turkeys ever to besmirch the silver screen.  My only regret in reviewing it is that I was forced to give it at least one star.  The only redeeming quality of this movie (aside from a scantily clad Lea Thompson) is that it's a delight to pick apart.  Seriously, ignore all the positive reviews -- this thing is one of the worst movies of ALL TIME!  Hilariously bad at times, but never intentionally.Happy viewing.

I give this thing ONE star ... I wouldn't even give it "1" if I could.Let's begin with a little background. I've bought/use many D-Link products for home and my personal business and am very happy and 99.999% satisfied with its quality, performance, and price. I've used their A, B, G, & N wireless routers, network cards, and PCMCIA cards.First, Setup. This may not be so crucial to some. When using the setup CD, you must have it connected to the internet for you to complete the setup - LAME for those of us proffessionals who practice setup on a stand-alone pc before putting it into production level. Manual setup - the worst menu driven system. It is similair to the old ones - yet some of the basics is annoyingly placed. But okay - whatever. Not a big deal.Second, DHCP with assigned static IP's - I have a couple network printers with odd MAC addresses that begin with 08:00 for some silly reasons - this router don't like it and while it still assigns an IP, I have no control over it. A little irritating - but whatever.The first and second would only reduce my 99% rating (nothing can be perfect yet) to maybe 90%... however, the following issue well - destroys any attempt at perfection it may have had.The most important aspect for general users: It drops packets and has major issues with port 80 (your http/web traffic). After a few hours or if someone logs in, or a new wireless connection is made, you gotta reboot this thing to fix it. UNACCEPTABLE!!! I've updated the firmware and got a replacement with similair REV A. A totally unstable product release. It was like an alpha test. Minus 5 stars!This was the worst product I've encountered from D-Link for a very long time. I use their "N" series NIC/PCMCIA cards with no problems. However, this was the first Wireless-N router I got so I gotta go search some more. Gonna buy two other brands and a different D-Link and compare.

This brush is very similiar to the "As seen on TV" version that is avail at Wally World for $9 -- the handles are all that is diff -- this is simply the more expensive version. I've told several friends about the brush & they have all gone & gotten it. I have a long haird beast of a cat -- a Maincoon -- she's all hair! A mini-cousin It! The brush works wonderfully on her. No hassles. No fighting her. And we could mold a new cat from all the hair it's removed! It even works as well on our short haired tabby.Try it -- you'll love it!

i had this for about a week before it stopped working. out of that week i think i used it three times. i only used it to store movies from satellite receiver. it was hooked up to the same surge protector as everything else. one day i got home from work & noticed it was off thinking it went to sleep, unfortunately it died! this left a bad taste in my mouth as this was the first time i have ever ordered ANYTHING online. bad thing is i live out of the country so my return shipping and import taxes cost more than 75% of the item price and they wont refund that. at least i should have gotten the forty five bucks for the return shipping back from amazon!the only reason i bought it was the fact that it had a power switch on the back so when i wasnt using it i could make sure that it was off. i ordered the 1TB drive , i should be getting it today, hope this one works. amazon should have an exchange policy for stuff like this. i would prefer that over what i went through to get another one

I have used Quicken on a Mac since 1992 and, because of previous problems with upgrades, I tend to put it off. However, my Quicken 2000 now operates only in Classic mode and I'm at Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger). So an upgrade to Quicken 2007 seemed in order. Having used Quicken for many years the file size has naturally grown and Quicken 2007 repeatedly crashed during the attempt to convert my 2000 version to 2007. The crash code Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS Codes: KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE usually means the program is trying to grab memory that doesn't belong to it and Quicken 2007 has the memory fixed at 20 MB rather than dynamic as most programs in Tiger do.Nor is it possible to increase the memory size for Quicken 2007.  Quicken 2007 did successfully convert a 10-year-old file that was only 1.7 MB in size so there appears to be a programming error regarding memory allocation.  Quicken support was useless in this case, with ridiculous suggestions like converting to a .QIF file and importing that to Quicken 2007, which didn't work, or stuffing and unstuffing the file before trying the conversion. No concern about memory allocation ever penetrated to their support group.  Also, despite carefully backing up my old data, the conversion attempt somehow wiped out all the price information for my investments in Quicken 2000 dating back 15 years. Fortunately, transaction data was preserved in the backups. But my only chance at recovery seems to be a manual input of data.

Stephanie Meyer has said, on more than one occasion, that the story of Bella and Edward was one of true, epic, love. That it wasn't just a story of teen romance - that there was nothing else like it. And I believed! So I was completely blindsided (as I'm sure were the rest of the believers) to have this truly one of a kind love story turned into a truly depressing  love triangle. Bella has gone from a girl who has found and is capable of true love to a girl who does the kind of things only a person with a real lack of maturity and compassion is capable of. The Bella we met in Twilight would never have been tempted by what Jacob had to offer or done any of the horrible things she does to Edward in Eclipse. She's lost her relatability.  Not many people would do any of those things to a mediocre boyfriend much less the love of their lives. Jacob has gone from a sweet kid to a man-beast who at his best is immature and at his worst is truly villainous (the whole lying and I'll kill myself if you don't make out with me was repugnant - almost as bad as the fact that Bella - Bella! went for it and Stephenie - Stephanie! wrote this as a love scene!) and Edward is taking poundings from both of them at every turn.The author must really love Jacob's character - it's the only explanation for what she's done to all of us. But please, please, write a separate series for Jacob and do what you can to salvage Bella and Edward. Do it for those of us who believed.

This is our 3rd (and LAST!) De Longhi expresso maker.The first one broke after a month.  The replacement had a cracked water tank, right out of the box and the last one (this one) burned the pump after two months!  Even though we cleaned all relevant parts MORE often than the manual even suggests.  We are still waiting for a replacement...While it worked, the coffee was good but, 2 months is way too short a life span for a product of this type.  And three defective units out of three is too high an average for us to waste out time with De Longhi products again.

I have made my husband the happiest man alive when I turned his boring breakfast cereal eating days into an exciting breakfast experience! One thing run toasting cycle first before you toast anything or you will get a weird plastic smell. The smell wears of after the first toasting cycle.#1 it cooks egg Mcmuffins to perfection#2 clean up is sooooo easy#3 it offers a variety of other dishes to be made!So what if the meat from heating tray drips off onto the food. I am a cook and know that this gives it much more flavor! If you are concerned just pat the poached egg with a paper towel (easy).Recipes I have come up with:1. Try havarti cheese instead of cheddar and put some steamed spinach on top of the egg, yummy, use with English muffin or croissant.2. Try smoked turkey breast deli slices for lower fat, cheddar cheese and spread raspberry jam on the bottom of the English muffin.3. Try Cheese whiz over an opened faced English muffin instead of hollandaise sauce.4. Try an opened faced egg sandwich, use cheddar cheese, sausage patty and poached egg and pour sausage gravy over top.If you want a low fat cheese try a soy pepper jack found at Giant. MMM much lower fat! The recipes are endless!!!!!!!!!! And much easier and cleaner too!!!

This monitor is great when it works.  I bought mine 6 months ago, and now it has ceased working.  I replaced the battery, and still nothing.  I would complain to Omron, but because it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth it.  Especially if the next one fails as well.  Also, the chest strap is too big  for me (I wear a size 8 in US women's clothing, 32 in bra size).  Even if I wear it as tight as it goes, it slips around.  I should have looked at smaller models, so that's entirely my fault.  The short lifespan of the device is most definitely not my fault however.

I recently ate at a local Japanese Hibachi Bar and I was more amazed by how sharp the knives that the chefs were using than the tricks that they performed as they cooked my meal. I said, man I gotta get a set of knives like that!A few years ago I bought a new set of knives from Amazon (J.A. Henckels Twin Signature 7-Piece Knife Block Set). The problem with this excellent set of knives is that the sharpener that came with it is one of those steel wands. A Master Chef can clank that wand back and forth against the blades of his knives with great precision to create a razor sharp cutting tool. I, on the other hand, somehow seem to have made the blades of my knife set duller using the dog-gone wand. So sitting there at the Hibachi bar I had an epiphany! A voice! It called out in my head...."Buy a better knife sharpener."Where better to look than the place that I bought my knives: Amazon. Type in: Knife sharpener. Lo and behold: dozens of choices of knife sharpeners!!! Woo-hoo! The Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener has a lot of high ratings; it's inexpensive...give it a try.Try I did, and the knives in my set are now sharper than they were when they arrived new! The Presto Pro is pretty cool: a 4-slot little machine that looks like a mini-toaster. Turn it on. To sharpen: apply very little pressure...run your blade 3 times through both slots on the left side of the toaster...er...I mean...sharpener; to hone: again...not too much pressure...run your blade 3 times through both slots on the right side of the sharpener. And voil! You're cutting through meat and veggies like a Master Hibachi Chef!Great little product. Stop reading my goofy review and add it to your cart.

My first camera was defective.  Pure Digital was no help.  I'm not even sure they have real people working there.  Maybe other people have had better experiences with them, but I got the feeling when I sent my camera back that they just opened my box and stuck my camera in another box and sent it back to me.  I don't think I've ever been so frustrated with a company before.My hat is off to Amazon, who sent me a replacement camera.  This one works and is just as easy and fun as all the positive reviews imply.  I'm sorry, though, that I had to deal with the manufacturer.  One star for Pure Digital, three stars for the camera (the one that works), and five stars for Amazon.com.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] (HD DVD)
      

Unfortunately I was not aware that there were "HD" DVDs that do not play in regular DVD players.  I purchased the Planet Earth Series for my grandson who ABSOLUTELY LOVES Planet Earth.  My daughter called me after Christmas to tell me that none of the 4 DVDs will play in their DVD Player.  They just get a continual message that the DVD is "loading".  I contacted the seller only to be told that if they don't have an "HD" DVD player they may not play.  He went on to inform me that if I return the DVDs and they play in HIS "HD" DVD player I cannot be issued a refund.I suppose I am responsible since his information DID state "HD" DVD, but I think the seller should have explained the difference in his information and specified the part about the HD" DVD player being required to play the DVDs.I have since ordered a regular DVD set, and it may even be from this same seller.  I wonder if anyone else has ever encountered this situation.

I couldn't put the New Moon down. I read it non-stop. I finished in 1 1/2 day. New Moon stirred my emotions and had me crying with Bella. I am excited to see how the Movie will live up to the book. I understand that certain activities will be different but all & all, I do hope that they make the book proud.

twilight used to be story about a girl and a vampire.  then it became a more interesting story about a girl, vampire, and werewolf.   A lot of packages came with the supernatural aspects of vampire and werewolf and a lot of small town romance in between. With Breaking Dawn, Meyer definitely tried too hard by sticking to the supernatural romance while attempting a suitable ending.  Neither one really happened.In the beginning, Bella and Edward are setting up for a wedding. Bella's pretty young, but marriage isn't too hard to swallow. Yet. In first part, Book 1, there's bits romance, Edward trying to protect Bella, Bella being frustrated by Edward; the "bread and butter" of the Twilight. However, Book1 then becomes about making love, sex, and pregnancy.  That's when the head scratching starts to happen.Book2, starts out better but gets really awkward, really fast.  Book2 is more about Jacob, which actually helps a lot.  He starts to take a more active role in the pack and appears somewhat decisive.  Then, the pregnancy issues come back into play.  Bella is basically being torn about from the pregnancy. Everything about the birth becomes really really creepy, especially when Jacob "imprints" with Bella's baby at the end of Book2.  I suppose they're meant to be together whenever the baby learns how to walk?Book3 basically becomes a wrap up section.  The half human-half vampire baby is born, a little fighting here and there, and then the stupidest part: the werewolves in La push aren't actually werewolves.  They're shapeshifters!!  Of all the explanations...shapeshifting? Oh, and they basically can only morph into wolves.  I'm being serious about that too.  The ridiculous ending isn't necessarily illogical; it's just really really optimistic.  Bella says at the end: And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever.  Is that really what the fans wanted?For some reason, Stephanie Meyer changed course and didn't figure out she was lost.  Not only did she make her story really awkward with childbirth and pregnancy, she basically turned her female protagonist into a vampire housewife.  That, while basically making the love triangle into a non factor.  On her website, S. Meyer has said the fans need time to get used to the ending.  Really, now?  Way to accuse the fans of not understanding your work.  I think if she spent more time writing, a better book would have popped out(no pun intended).  The sad part, is that even if Meyer wrote a great final book, she probably wouldn't have sold any more copies. The hype was everywhere and the bookstores bought into it.  What's even sadder, is that she basically lost a really great chance of clinching the respect from an audience that loved her.

I set this drive as a Time Machine backup for my Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.5.  The drive is absolutely stunning especially with the pretty led lights in the front.  It was great for... two days, and it stopped working right after a simple unplugging of the surge protector that was connected to the computer and the drive.  I also have two other drives in the same computer, they both survived and they've survived these accidents before with no issues.  However, the MyBook Home Ed. could not be used by Time Machine after this.  Used Disk Utility to repair the disk, but it found NO errors on the disk (?), but Time Machine still could not use the disk.  So I tried to reset the drive by unmounting from the OS, then unplugging the power cord from the back of the drive and then back.  This time the drive simply did not even power up.  No lights; it was totally dead.  I have 6 other external drives.  I've never had this kind of failure with any of them.   This drive does get hot, and it has no fan in the unit; so I wonder if that contributes to the high failure rate of WD MyBook....

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I have to admit I loved Twilight series when I first read them. But, then I started to think about what it promotes. I think Stephanie Meyer goes too close to the line and uses too much sensuality in a book geared towards teenagers. Her second and third book are much worse. It's sad to see an LDS author lower her standards to reach the national market. She didn't have to. She had a great plot that could have been written without the "steamy sections".Here's some of the problems I had with the series:1. Bella is constantly lying to her father.2. Bella and Edward constantly flirt with going too far.3. In the 3rd book all Bella can think about is having sex with her boyfriend.4. Edward constantly stays in Bella's room overnight. They may not do "anything" but that is a recipe for disaster. How many teenagers are going to think that is okay or normal or that they can do that without getting into trouble.5. Swear Words (even though they are "mild", can't you write a book without them?)6. In-modest dresses that teenagers are trying to emulate. Stephanie Myers goes to great length to describe Bella's prom dress which was inspired from a runway dress she saw. How many mothers out there are okay with their daughters wearing dresses straight from the model runways?7. Bella just does what she wants without thinking of others.Don't even start the series! I wouldn't want my girls to get hooked and then read #3 - Eclipse! That one is definitely crossing the line. Too much sensuality and absolutely no morals! Not a good role model for our teens

8/10/2006: After some early and initial troubles with issues that seemed to be stemming from this router, after many more months of use, i have changed my mind about this router. It has actually provided solid quality during the past months. I don't know why it's not giving me the old problems it did...maybe it was too close to another electrical device or maybe I had some settings set incorrectly.2005-2006: I get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers. Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink. At first, i thought it was just one bad apple. However, I currently own 3 linksys routers and dozens of wireless pc and laptop cards, and all of them are giving me problems.Stay away from these linksys routers. At best, each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait 10 minutes to get back online again. if you're doing something important, forget it!

I ordered one of these boxes just before Christmas since I hate cleaning the litter box and this seemed like it would make the job much easier for me.  I had read the reviews and it seemed that the majority were good so I decided to try it out.  I was amazed at how quickly it arrived.  I immediately opened it and put it together.  I did have a little trouble with the clips, as mentioned in other posts, but it wasn't a big deal for me.  My 2 cats were wary of using it at first.  I already had one covered box and one uncovered box so I didn't think having the cover on would deter them, but they steered clear of it that first day so I took the top off until I saw it had been used.  I put the top back on the next day and they've been using it ever since.  I love how easy it is to use.  I got to the point that I hated having to scoop my other box when this one was so easy to do, so last week I ordered another one and now I can clean both boxes in less time than it used to take to clean one.   I use World's Best Cat Litter and have had no problems.  I had read some of the reviews that mentioned the poo sticking to the grill, so I just make sure that I don't clean the box right after they have used it.  My cats don't cover theirs, but the litter seems to draw out the moisture quickly so it has hardened by the time I empty the box.  So far I haven't had any trouble with anything sticking to the grill.  My husband always used to complain about the smell from the litter boxes and since I've been using this one we haven't noticed a smell at all.  That is probably due to the fact that I am actually cleaning it every day so it never has much in it.  In the past I would put it off thinking I didn't have time right then to do it.  Now, I just clean it when I get home from work and it's done in less than a minute!  I highly recommend this box.  The little bit of litter that may spill when you are turning it is nothing compared to the litter the cats used to kick out of the other litter boxes I had.  And because it is covered I don't find little "presents" on the floor where the cat missed the box while doing her business.  I've been looking for the "perfect" litter box for years, and I think this one fits the bill.

If a movie does not have English closed captions for the hearing impaired, then this house hold will not be able to purchase any DVD.  English closed caption for the hearing impaired is a part of the Americans with Disabilities act.  Movie makers (producers) and networks (CBS and HBO) need to wake up and realize the English hearing impaired are a huge part of the buying public.

I have been having problems shaving ever since I joined the Navy at age 18. Having course, curly facial hair, I constantly had to deal with painful ingrown hairs and irritation.  So, over the next 12 years, I ended up tried just about everything from top of the line Disposables, expensive safety and straight razors and even laser hair removal. But nothing seemed to work.I have also had my share of electric shavers and clippers. Over the years, I've grown disappointed with the quality of electric shaves. They either didn't cut all of the hair, which lead to ingrown hairs or really irritated my face, which lead to ingrown hairs :(After reading the reviews about the PocketGo p-70 and after seeing the price of it, I'd figured that I would give it a shot.Much to my surprise, this little, inexpensive shaver gives me the best shave that I ever had. Granted, I had to train my face, such as removing all of the current ingrown hairs that I had and using a facial scrub to help remove all of the harden skin, from razor shaving, off of my face. Note: being that my facial skin was hard, my facial hair difficulty breaking the surface and with either lay flat against my face or curl back under. I also used a electric eyebrow shaver to the trim the hairs that were too long for the razor to cut. After doing this for about a week, my face has completely cleared up and with no signs of irritation. I use the razor, as my primary shaver, everyday and would highly, highly recommend it.

I very much looked forward to viewing this movie. All of the reviews made it seem sweet and cute. However I was disappointed to find it is only more preaching of the politically correct. And further disappointed to see that the only negative reviews revolved around the way the dvd worked. Come on people!! When are we going to see that we are being led down a path of Hollywood and Disney's choosing.

I bought a WRT54GS a couple years ago and it still works well.  I wanted another, to run wired and wireless devices in my garage.  To save a few cents on RAM, Linksys changed operating systems and other details on that model, and advertised the WRT54GL as the model similar to my old one.  I bought it, put it away, and finally got to it recently.  I was shocked when I opened it:  the WRT54GL has no wired ports, only a wireless transmitter.  Maybe someone will find that useful, but it's unlikely -- someday you'll have a PC or laptop with a wired port that you want to plug in and cannot because this unit only talks wireless.  It's useless for me, and now it's been too long since I bought it to return it.  Why does Linksys cut corners this way?  Cutting the wired ports cut their costs by $1 or less. Argh.

I bought Breville juicer after using Jack LaLanne's.I feel very sorry when buying this juicer because it is extremely difficult to control. If pressure is light, fruits or vegies do not go through, and when more pressure is pressed, they go through too fast. And usually at the end of juicing there is a strong jerking motion because fruite or vegies go through UNprocessed, no matter what speed is.If you use Jack Lalanne before you will love Jack's much more than this. I think this machine is for someone wants to waste fruits or vegetables because the pulp in container is heavier than Jack's.I use it for 2 weeks and I come back to Jack LaLanne. Breville better RE-designs this one.

I don't know why I got rid of the last model of yogurt maker, we were remodeling the kitchen, and I thought I did not need the Salton Yogurt maker.I was wrong.I started making yogurt using a quart canning jar and the microwave convection oven as a heat source. I have a microwave convection oven which can be set at 100 degrees F. I used it to make the yogurt. Worked great except the microwave oven was tied up while the yogurt was being made. Also, the constant noise from the microwave convection oven drove me crazy.It's so much quieter to use the Salton yogurt maker. It quietly sits on the counter keeping the yogurt mixture gently warmed and about 6 to 10 hours later you will have a quart of homemade, preservative free, yogurt. Yummy!I use the enclosed recipe which calls for plain yogurt, dried milk, and fresh milk. You can use dried or evaporated milk too, if you choose. What I do is make up a batch of Nido whole milk using the milk powder sold at Amazon. You also need to use plain yogurt with active cultures. Pick a brand of yogurt you like as the flavor of your homemade yogurt will closely resemble the plain yogurt purchased as the starter. Follow the recipe directions which include heating the milk, allowing it to cool, and then adding the yogurt starter. Place the container in the yogurt maker, place the lid on the yogurt, and about 6 to 8 hours later you have yogurt.Very easy, very tasty. You can later make yogurt cheese by using a small strainer or by purchasing a yogurt cheese maker sold at Amazon. Yogurt cheese is thick, rich and delicious. You can spice it up with garlic and herbs or make a sweet cheese. Your preference.I am glad to have the Salton Yogurt maker back in action in my kitchen. It was missed.

The Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box was everything it promised. Just roll the litter pan over, the loose clean litter falls into the grate, the clumping dirty litter rolls over the crate onto the outside panel. When you roll the litter box back up right, the clumps of dirty litter and waste fall into the slide out tray.  Remove the tray by the handle, dump contents into the trash and replace. The clean litter falls back through the grate and Kitty has a clean litter the use. The entire process only takes a minute. Really! I only have one cat, so once every two weeks I unsnap the lid and empty the entire contents into the trash, spray the inside out with water and replace with new litter. You never have to pickup a scratched litter bag again. I have recommended it to all my friends.

Great Camera. the software it comes with is so bad. not like oh I cant edit sort of bad. more like you cant watch the movies or burn them sort of bad. so get ready to spend some more on a converter program and then an editing program. adobe premier is on its way to me. Second. the battery. if your dropping a grand on a camcorder you wont mind dropping a couple hundred on accessories. but the battery they supply with the camcorder should not even exist. We should all unite and write to canon demanding a free B-127. it should be a recall that you get a free B-127 if you have bought the HG21 or HG20. completely bogus. The sound sucks. get the mic. dm-100. don't try and get the dm-50. it doesn't fit. the lighting it bad also. make sure you have the sun on your side. the viewfinder is not great. it sits flush so there is no rubber that surrounds your eye. so nothing to keep the sunlight out. thats obvious. I think they just hastily slapped this viewfinder on and forgot the principles of camera making. I mean they have been at it since the seventies. did they forget you need to cover your eye while in the view finder? idiots. another design flaw. every time you stop recording it segments the videos. you should be able to put them together on your camcorder. you can break them up just fine. but you cant put them together if you wanted to. but thats why we get adobe premier. tripod is necessary. don't go without it. this camera is a dainty little thing. please try not to drop it. So get it if you don't mind dealing with the problems i listed. remember to write to canon and tell them the software sucks and you want a free B-127 battery.

I asked for this for christmas after thinking spur of the moment I wanted a bread machine, I read some reviews and then went for it.I love it. The first loaf was perfect. I have been making the basic sandwich with weat, white, walnut and a few other recipies that come with the machine. They have all been perfect and it takes about 10 minutes to measure and place ingredients in machine. The timer works great, I wake up to fresh bread.  Cleaning is so quick, it is quiet and easy to use.  It is tall, so if you have smaller cabniets you might need to measure. But it is light.  If I had known making bread was so easy, I would have gotten one a long time ago.  I look forward to trying more recipies.

The new installation from cd is Excellent. very user friendly and any one with out knowledge about router can install one. This great installation wouldn't help if the router it self does not work. It worked good for around 10 hours and there began trouble. At regular intervals the router is freezing . So I updated the firmware ( My ver. is 8.0.0.. and updated to 8.0.2...).  There was no use, the problem continued so, I ordered replacement which I got in no time. The hell with the new one is very serious. It didn't even last   five hours. I have to restart the router and again after 5-10 hours it freezes again.

I have used Pampers Swaddlers on my baby girl for 16 months with no problems at all.  Then, I finally switched to Cruisers (she's still small, less than 20 pounds, but is walking so I thought it was time to switch when I ran out of Swaddlers).  Well, my first problem with the Cruisers is how cheaply they are made!  The "sticky" closure tabs are a disaster.  In the first package, I must have had at least 5 or 6 that were either missing one or both tabs, or one of the tabs was "sewn" down to the diaper and unusable.  So frustrating!  I hate throwing away an unworn diaper!  Waste of money and just a waste of a diaper.My daughter also got her very first diaper rash of her entire life within about a week of starting to use the Cruisers.  Never had a single problem with any kind of irritation when she was wearing Swaddlers, but now she seems to get them frequently and they are so bad that they make her squirm and writhe and scream in pain, not only when I'm changing her diaper but any time that she is sitting down while wearing even a slightly dirty/wet Cruisers diaper.  I have 3 bags of these left (luckily I didn't buy a 6-month supply!) and I think I will throw them out.  It wasn't until I read other negative reviews about diaper rashes that I put 2 + 2 together that this must be the cause of my daughter's horrible rashes.  Going to Cruisers is the only change I've made with her and suddenly she is breaking out in open-sored rashes every week.  If I can prevent this agony for her, then it's good-bye Cruisers!!

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)
      

Why is it that most movie "classics" that are cheered and applauded today turn out to be incredibly lousy? I purchased Gone With The Wind on DVD for my mom nearly a year ago, but it wasn't until this September that we were able to sit down and watch it. And perhaps I've been spoiled by such epics as "Lord of the Rings" and "Spider-Man", but I simply did not find Gone with the Wind enjoyable at all. No, it wasn't simply because there wasn't epic battles or superhero combat, but because the story itself was not entertaining.THE PLOT: Scarlet O'Hara is a southern belle lady living in the lap of luxury with her mother, father, and two sisters on a plantation named Tara. She is the envy of all the ladies, and the desire of all the men. Yet she has her heart fixed on one specific individual, Ashley Wilkes. She is devastated to learn at a party that her Ashley has given his heart to another woman, Melanie. At the same party, famed philanderer and charmer Rhett Butler sees Scarlet and falls in love with her.Meantime, rumors of war are troubling the South. It is rumored that the Union Yankees are readying efforts of war against the South to free the slaves and defeat the Rebels. Celebration comes when it is confirmed that war is abound, and every man able rides to sign up. To get back at Ashley, Scarlet pledges marriage to a young man about to go into battle, but he later dies.Long story made short, they all fight a big war, lots of people killed. Ashley goes off to war, and leaves a pregnant wife in Scarlet's care. Scarlet must attempt to birth the baby in the midst of a huge battle. Rhett manages to come to her aid, but then deserts her to join the army, ashamed of his previous attitude of "only in it for the money" service for the South. Scarlet makes her way home to Tara, and finds her beloved home devastated by war. Her mother dead, her father half-crazy with grief, and the possessions stolen by the Yankees. The rest of the doggone tale is spent chronicling Scarlet's plucky and spirited attempts to save her house, and make true her pledge never to be hungry again, as well as her reckless lifestyle post-war.GOOD: Well, I know I SHOULD be able to find good in this movie, but I'm sorry! It's just that where I come from, we're used to having the main character or characters be GOOD. I can definitely say the acting is good, the music is good, and the scale on which this movie was made certainly reflects excellent quality. BAD: Scarlet is a self-centered idiot who doesn't care who she hurts as long as she gets her way. She callously marries a soldier who is killed in battle, and then despises her mourning clothes she must wear after that. She finally casts off her false mourning to dance with Rhett. She marries another man her sister was in love with, simply to get his money so she can pay off massive taxes on Tara. She stupidly clings to a love for Ashley despite his marriage to Melanie. Interestingly enough, when we are first introduced to Rhett Butler, he's a renown scoundrel, yet even his heart is saddened by the war, and moved by love. Yet Scarlet seems to obtain Rhett's attitude of "only in it for the money". Aside from the morally bankrupt characters, the movie over all is not a positive, upbeat film one might enjoy watching. Death, bloodshed, and violence pervade the film. Did all this stuff happen? Of course! Is it being reclusive and callous not to want to concentrate on all the evils that took place in the Civil War? I think not. THOUGHTS: There is something about this movie that seems to attract fans, despite being fraught with spiteful, cruel characters. Perhaps it is the massive scale on which the movie is shot. There is no question the cinematography is very well done. The music is gorgeous. The acting is commendable. The clothes are a reason often touted when I ask with genuine curiosity "WHY did you like this movie?" But I still must raise objections to good acting, music, and cinematography all surrounding a bunch of 1800's jerks. You decide. I personally was disappointed to recognize the actor playing Ashley Wilkes as the actor who had previously starred in an ancient TV serial of Sherlock Holmes. The man was perfect for the role, and carried it out brilliantly, so to see him as the sniveling Rebel soldier was almost sad for me. I've gotten my main point across, but being as this movie is a genuine classic, I don't doubt most of you will want to buy it. If you do, you'll probably prefer the DVD. *Note* The DVD contains hardly any extras: Theatrical trailer, and a few quizzes. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars.

Not good.  Excel / Word -- Microsoft replaced the old toolbars with "ribbons".  If you're new to Office, you may like the ribbons. If you have been using office for a while and prefer to use shortcut keys instead of the mouse, you will hate it.  I haven't seen any new features that make it worth the change.Outlook --  horrible.  freezes constantly and seldom opens correctly the fist time (I'm writing this review as I wait for Outlook to try and open for the sixth consecutive time).  more difficult to assign categories to calendar entries via shortcut keys.  Again, I haven't found any features that offset the drawbacks.Office has a "print to .pdf" add in.  This is good.  However, you can get the same funcitonality by downloading CutePDF for free.  The headaches of Office 2007 are not worth it.  by the way, I have always been a fan of Office products is the past.  This upgrade was a waste.  Actually, it has negative value becuase of the time I waste every time I use it.

Slingmedia has a notice on their support site that this is a known problem (the notice has been there for at least 2 months).  But they admit they can't solve it.See slingmedia support site subject "Streaming in SlingPlayer slows and doesn't recover"My advice...great idea...was a great product...don't buy.

I want to give this a 5* review, but there are a few very minor faults I have noticed in the past 10 hrs or so, so I think it deserves a 4.5... unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow that, so I'll hafta settle for a 4....  This review is based on  a machine with the 2 GB RAM upgrade.Pros:Love the multitouch for the most part... dunno how humans have lived without that for so long...Very small compared to laptops (and obviously desktops).Looks snazzy.Great screen... works fine outdoors (although it wasn't particularly sunny out).Very long-lasting, fast-charging battery (7.5 hr battery life for me with wireless/bluetooth turned off)  Charged out of the box to full charge in 55 minutes.Plays basic video games at the very least(ie PopCap games) flawlessly even when not in high performance mode.Networking is a breeze... fast wireless... and BLUETOOTH.Runs office programs, browsers, divx movies (fullscreen too), youtube fullscreen (not so much with HD), and lots of other stuff very smoothly.Upgrades for ram/hdd are very easy.Nice comfortable-sized keyboard (I have average-sized man-hands), with a good layout.Windows XP! And a disc containing XP!  Holy crap! Unheard of...Great price.Faster than my desktop (heh)...Cons:Spacebar gives very little feedback/very sensitive, and sometimes seems to get stuck (or it could just be that I leave my finger on it without realizing, because of the lack of feedback.)Mouse buttons somewhat hard  to click, but multi-touch interface makes up for it big time.Can't really get the hang of zooming in/out with multi-touch... im sure I'll get it down, but right now it seems to work only about 50% of the time... everything else about multitouch is excellent though.No CD Rom drive (but I already knew this, and so do you, most likely)-- I don't think this is a big deal though... pretty sure you could just use a program like poweriso or something like that, along with a large USB flash drive (assuming you have another computer).Online streaming audio tends to click a bit... MP3s, and the audio from my AVI movies and video games are perfect though.Fingerprint magnet.All in all, a great purchase!  I could see myself using this thing more than my main computer.  I love it.  Its totally worth it, so just buy it!  I would have paid 70-100 bucks more if I'd had the chance to give it a test-drive first.

I just bought a new computer that runs on Vista.  Installation of TurboTax was impossible.  I kept getting the UNHANDLED EXCEPTION 0x80040707 ERROR.  I went to the TurboTax support site for help.  The information they provided did not solve the problem and the only available next step was to submit my email address.  The Quicken reply message was not helpful and only stated that they will email me when they have a solution to the problem.  Cold comfort for someone who bought the product that is supposed to be Vista compatible.  Shame on you, Quicken!FYI...I installed it on Windows XP without any problem eventhough it did take quite a long time for the installation.  So, if you have Vista, perhaps you should find another tax prep product.

I am a huge fan of the founding fathers, and did not think there was any way that this series would disappoint me.  However, the story was dull outside of the real life large events.  The actors did not perform as well as other series and films in done in this era.  I very rarely give extremely poor reviews, but this series was just a disappointment from the first episode to the last.On the other hand, for anyone that knows history, I love Alexander Hamilton, and this series makes him look very bad.  So, my opinion may be slightly skewed, but I found very little to like about this series.Best Wishes.

I've had this for less than a year(9 months), and I'd say I use it about 2-4 times a week.  It doesn't work properly anymore.  I guess there is a shortage in the cord or something.  Some times it doesn't turn on, and I have to wiggle the cord and hold it in a certain direction for it to work.  Of course, as others stated.. if you buy it online/amazon, the warranty is VOID, so I'm going to have to buy a new one.

As a few people have already confirmed this is the 16 MB memory model that you can put custom firmware on.  I can't say much about the original Linksys firmware because it only "lasted" about an hour until I uploaded dd-wrt.  The router has been running perfectly fine ever since, I couldn't be happier with it.  If you know what dd-wrt is this is the device you're looking for!

Havent used them yet but I was a little disappointed in the quality. I only paid about 16 dollars for them so I guess its not a bad buy but I see where they are selling for much more now. Sateen in the same thread count would probably be more comfy and durable.

Yes the product is awkward to hold and operate at first but you can get use to that.  My problem is it does not get close enough to the skin.  I do not want any visible hair in my nose, and this product does not cut close enough to the skin to avoid this.  Furthermore, they claim that the product does not pull hair, but it does.  I have not used it one full time without it pulling some of the hairs.

I am specifically commenting on the latest Logitech Dual Action design. This improved pad, which is now widely available at retail and distinguished from its flawed predecessor by a new "shift" key with a red LED, is nearly perfect as a reasonably priced PC analog pad. I have used it heavily for over a year now with NO degradation in the analog switch sensitivity. Both sticks have a higher quality "feel" right out of the box. Perhaps I could wish for analog triggers or a more robust feeling D-pad, but not too much should be expected from a $20 controller. A few other users appear to be confused over the pad's compatibility. A PC game does not need to find this constroller compatible for it to be useful. The wonderful Logitech Profiler software, while a bit unwieldly when creating button assignments, emulates keyboard input as a background program while playing the game. The only game (out of hundreds I've tried) that blocked the Profiler software was Red Faction. No it's not quite as easy as the plug-n-play nature of console peripherals, but PC gaming is always a little more tricky. For $20, it's a great buy for the action/sports/shooter fan.I want to emphasize that this review ONLY covers the most recent model, and not the older design that  didnt have a shift key. That model used really cheap analog switches that deteriorate quickly.

I purchased this product thinking that it would revolutionize my financial organization -but I should have known better after I have started to read all of the product reviews.I can't even give a thorough review, since I can't seem to get past even downloading my savings & checking information from my bank.  The incorrect balances are showing, and the register doesn't show all of the transactions that my banking website shows.  I'm finding that I have to actually check my banking website to cross-check Quicken!  To me, that ain't so quick.I've just spent over 45 minutes on an online "chat" - which was more of a waste of time than anything.  The customer's support suggestions pretty much entailed deleting files, restarting, deleting files, restarting.10 minutes ago, he wrote this:Ashish R.: Thank you.Ashish R.:  Please  give me 2 minutes only.Stacey: I think I would just like to return the product...Stacey: It isn't working...Stacey: are you still there?Stacey: Right...Stacey: Hello?I'm still sitting here waiting.  I want to return this product - DO NOT BUY!

I too, wanted to love this camera.  Boots up fast, lightweight, great price, works great w/imovie 09.  Problem was poor indoor picture quality, very pixelly.  I did not even try it outside because the indoor quality was so bad, i just boxed it up and sent it back.  Bought from J&R, had no problem returning it, it just cost me $15 to return with insurance of course.  Great camera for internet video or just for youtube.  I can't believe this camera has gotten a four star average. I guess most of the reviewers have never had a digital camcorder.  Not even close to MiniDV quality. I guess I will have to spring for the HF100.

We thought this would be a fun Christmas gift for our two miniature pinschers.  But, the instructions to put it together don't have words (that's right, only picturs) which left us to our own devices to figure it out.  One of the beds is cockeyed because the screw that came with it was bent.  The other one is fine.

I got this shaver for a Christmas gift from my fiance. I read all the reviews online and on Men's Health and decided to get this instead of the Phillips.Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin.This razor did nothing like all the ads states. It was a rough shave. Had to go over my face numerous times and even dig the razor into the the neck to get at some whiskers.It left my face red and bumpy and my skins burned for hours after the shave.I ultimately returned it to Braun being very disappointed and now am searching for a new razor and looking at the new Phillips.I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone-especially if you have a soft sensitive face and skin.Sorry Braun....Sorry Amazon but I am just being very honest to try and help the other consumers who may look at this.Hope this helps......

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2)I first read Twilight in Hungarian. New Moon will only be released in Hungarian at April 2009, and I was so fascinated by the story that I could not wait until it arrives... :))) So I ordered immediately the whole serie from Amazon.com.I fell irrevocably and unconditionally in love with that really true love story. Not only it gave me a great practice in my English, but I was amazed how genious Stephenie Meyer was to give a wholly new aspect to the well-known vampire tales: placing it in our modern world. Like your neighbour could be a vampire, and you didn't even know about it... Seeing true love's victory over all troubles... I will always be fond of it. New Moon goes even deeper in that world. Thanks, Stephenie! :)))

They told me I just got a "bad" hard drive and that I would have to pay ~1,500$ for data recovery from them, even though they produced the product that failed.  The also kept me on hold for 2 hours to get another external hard drive, which I never got.

My laptop recently crashed and of course, I had to reload all the programs. I couldn't find my back up discs and so I chose to update my Office program. It is a huge improvement over 2003, more options, better navigation but be aware, you have to save things in the format that matches the format the people you are sharing with.  2007 Excel does not read on 2003, this was the only glitch I found but easily it was saved and resent.

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)
      

The one-two whammy of audience and critical indifference to "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia" killed Walt Disney's desire to experiment with the limits of animation in the 1940s. From then on, play it safe was his motto. This may be one of the greatest tragedies to beset popular American culture in the 20th century; despite the depths of pretension and kitch in "Fantasia," it was at least evidence of a spirited mind in pursuit of the unattained -- but "Pinocchio" must have broken old Walt's heart. There are visual effects in this movie that remained unchallenged until the digital age, and it's worth recalling that every single one of them was drawn by hand. It has one of the most beautiful and exciting musical scores in the history of the movies (I can't hear Cliff Edwards' high, pure falsetto holding that final note of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without chills), a deeply plangent sense of emotion that never tips over into bathos, and a wealth of detail that is still staggering after 65 years. But it may be too dark a movie to attain the popularity of more cheerful Disney cartoons like "Snow White" -- although even that one can frighten the tots. Now: where is the double-disc Special Platinum Edition???

I bought this laptop because of its portability and attractiveness. The configuration seemed to be good enough for my business, but it didn't. The first thing I want to mention here is the CPU. Be careful! You can be cheated, as I was, by the 1.6mHz CPU chip: it's not Intel or other brandnames, it's VIA and damn it! It's the worst CPU I have experienced in my life: warm up so fast and very very slow. I don't know why HP didn't put in there an Intel Atom chip, which is much more reasonable for a portable device like this.Secondly, the pre-installed Vista business really makes you crazy by its speed. It takes you at least 2 minites to boot up the machine and it forces the fan to work always at the highest capacity. Some people say it needs to be downgraded to WinXP, but why HP didn't do that for the customers? Because not everyone can do that with ease!In short, I think this mini-notebook would be great if HP gets rid of the VIA chip and put in the Intel Atom, and replace Vista with XP.Anyway, I returned my notebook only one day after I'd received it! Bad purchase.

I was just about jaded with all these new HD cameras, when I ran into this by accident, scanning through Google.I had purchased an Kodak Easyshare M1033, then a Zi6, they both failed miserably at even coming close to Standard definition, let alone high definition. They had alot of motion artifact, alot of graininess at any light exposure, and were useless in the dark. They went to new owners.I had about given up until I saw this when perusing products at 2009 CES. I have had it one day, but it surpasses the products that I have used and that are out there.First off, images are clear, for real, not grainy. It actually has 4 different light settings - sports, landscape, backlight, and lowlight. None of the other 'pocket cameras' have this. This is extremely important, or you can forget recording video in your home.Secondly, it has an led light that can be utilized to record in the dark...what a great idea!!! It maximizes battery life, and extends your video range. Amazing difference.Next, it has a real optical zoom, not some fake digital zoom. At whats more, when you zoom, it doesnt blurr, like the Nikon and Kodak video footage I have seen and made. Another gigantic leap.It has all necessary connectivity, component cables, usb, and it is very intuitive to use. After about 30 minutes with it, you can film your own documentary. But even in simple terms, once the clock is set you can start filming immediately. Just change from sports setting to another light setting before you start, or you will see a black screen indoors. Oh, and, take the lens cap off.Ok, memory, it has 12mb onboard, which will get you a few pics, and 15 seconds of HD video. Yeah, eh...But it does have a pro duo slot. I was certainly not excited about this, I have alot of SD cards lying around. But I looked for a good deal, and dealt with it. Video compression is nice, and you get about 1 sec per MB, or about 140 min with an 8gb card. This is actually better than the kodak compression, as far as storage.Also, videos are simple to use. Simple to play on a computer, just plug in the usb, you dont need a pro duo slot on your pc. I uploaded easily to Youtube, and also played them nicely on my 42" big screen. Another plus, it runs through all the videos with one click. Some folks may not like this, but I dont like to click on all 40 videos I recorded, just play em all, and skip if you want. Otherwise, you would be sitting by the tv changing them the whole time, while everyone else enjoys. Nice idea, Sony.Sony thought of other nice things as well, including wrist strap, concise packaging, lens cap strap, and nice charging setup. Leave those AAs at home Kodak Zi6. It even takes pictures!Take it from me, the Webbie does much more than anything else out there in the $150-$400. If you are going to spend $200 anyway, why not get a serious camera that blows away the competition. You wont be disappointed. This will be the camera everyone has within 3 months.

The sides and bottom of the freezer bowl build up with a THICK layer of inedible over-frozen ice cream that has to be chisled off. Meanwhile, the ice cream in the center of the bowl never even develops to the soft serve stage! AAARGH!

It was a cute movie but the political overtones to the movie were hard to accept. Without giving away the movie, I just don't buy the basic premise that the movie starts with and certainly not the ending. Realistically, you have to be pretty depressed or hopeless to create this kind of storyline. It might be ok for kids who won't get the political part but otherwise not recommended.

Transformers is a movie in the same way that my house is a movie. Which is to say, not.My house doesn't have a plot. Neither does Transformers. My house doesn't have characters.

This is the best wheel I've used. Its really nice. If your looking for a wheel you should really consisder this one. I use it for my PS3 and it works perfectly. The only downside is that it doesnt have a PS button so you will need your controller to exit the game or turn off your PS3. I would also suggest you dont buy it from Tigerdirect or Compusa. Its where I got mine and it was used. I have read many reviews saying the wheel in bad shape but I just bought it from them anyways. Overall this is the best wheel, just buy it from a trusted seller.

As long as I moisten the chest strap, this reliably reports my heart rate.  I checked it by comparing with gym machines that detect my pulse from handlebars.   Most gym machines will also pick up the signal from the chest strap, so the watch receiver isn't necessary in that place.  Some of the gym machines will display random glitches even when nobody else is nearby and the wrist receiver shows a believable pulse.The main problem is that the watchband is stiff.  With my narrow wrists, it won't lie flat against the wrist near the buckle.  It's not uncomfortable, it just doesn't fit right.

I am really impressed with this pedometer.  The accuracy is great, it's easy to use, the clip (and safety strap) work well, and the software gives you lots of data to keep you motivated.  I really like how the software displays number of aerobic steps and shows you the hour-by-hour activity of each day.  If you're wondering whether this pedometer counts "steps" on an elliptical machine at a gym -- Yes!  This little device has really motivated me to go the "extra mile."  Mission accomplished!

After weeks of still troubleshooting my connection, my cable company in an effort to prove this unit is defective, has hooked up two modems to my cable line in the office.  Both modems are identical, when mine fails, the comcast laoner is still lit up.  They are on the both line so I know it's not my wiring, the isp, or my signal strength.  For what ever reason this particular unit is defective.

I love the Acer; I've had no wireless problems, the keyboard is just big enough to be completely useable, and the screen is even surprisingly useable.  The installed OS is quite sufficient for most uses, but not quite enough for mine --- if they'd bundled a better email client (specifically support for s/mime and pgp, which most people don't use, but should), and a remote desktop and pptp client into it, I could have stuck with it, but I gave up and installed ubuntu 8.04.  I give up properly card slot handling, but a usb card reader is effectively as convenient, and the card slot handling will probably be fixed in the upcoming release aimed at subnotebooks.  I also got a Logitech V220 mouse to avoid the awkward mousepad buttons.  The v220 self-stores the usb dongle and is quite convenient.Another complaint is having to disassemble the thing to add memory.  It has a sodimm slot on the backside of the motherboard, but no cover on the bottom of the case that would provide easy access trivially.  Go figure.  Fortunately, linux is lightweight enough it's not really needed.Also: no bluetooth, which would be nice to enable a dongle-less mouse and a headset for voip chatting, but is far from a requirement.And finally, it would be nice if they built in whole disk encryption too --- with the frequency of laptop thefts, that should be a defacto standard.  I can't fault them for not doing what no one else is doing, but it needs to be said.So to sum it up: it's a nearly perfect lightweight laptop with these minor weaknesses:1.  lacking email and disk encryption/vpn/remote desktop software2.  awkward mousepad buttons3.  memory upgrade access4.  missing bluetooth

We purchased this product with high hopes of trimming our two dogs nails on a regular basis. We started using it and it took forever to get one nail done. If you press in on the sanding surface the rotation stops and you are stuck with the speed it is defaulted too. After many a treats to reward the dogs for putting up with the device...we returned it along with the replacement heads. For the 30.00 paid for everything...I am going to use the money and a few more dollars and get a real dremel tool which can serve other purposes.

I love nature shows and I really appreciate learning about the planet, but I could really do without all the global warming junk that is constantly infiltrating more and more of these programs. There is no such thing as man-made global warming! The earth experiences natural cycles of warming and cooling all the time. The sun is by far the largest contributer to weather patterns and not how much I drive my car around town or if the industry down the street is operating or not. There are much more important concerns for humanity to be concerned with such as the over 50 million babies that have been murdered in the United States alone since Roe Vs. Wade. I think that's a bit more important than anything.

This company in their infinite wisdom gave this unit the SAME address as the common ATandT yahoo modem. To correct this problem hook up the modem with the router and sign on to the internet, but wait...they dont work together because of the conflict. You therefore cant sign on with them hooked up to correct the problem. Does this sound circular? There is a customer support line for you to call LONG DISTANCE and be on hold for half an hour or better at YOUR expense. There you get someone that has learned a years worth of ENGLISH from a book so cant understand what you are saying. After several minutes of them not being able to understand your questions, they drop connection. You can either get BACK in the customer support line...on hold...long distance at YOUR expense, or throw the item in the trash. Please dont waste your money. Before you buy ANY router, please go to its support page. See if your DSL provider is listed there with NUMEROUS complaints. Though to be fair, I can understand how small the company AT and T is and therefore why THIS company hasnt bothered to put out a product that does not conflict. Also be aware that their web site has BLATENTLY written "We give NO refunds for ANY reason". Now if this unit were NOT such a problem why would they NEED to write that! Please ignore the GLOWING reviews written by employees of this company and go see their web page for yourself. BEWARE! The company doesnt give refunds so Im essentially throwing over a hundred bucks in the trash. Wanna join me or you wanna pass this by?

This camcorder is simply great. Small, excellent video quality, and an extremely convenient storage. Like many other costumers, I was divided between the HF100 and HF10 models, but here is a definitive difference that, after two moths, made my choice the right one: I've lost a very important recording with a defective Transcend SDHC 16gb card when plugging it to my computer. So, first of all, I recommend buying cards from traditional brands, to avoid headaches. Second, as the HF10 has 16gb of internal memory, you're able to record to it and then copy the files to the SDHC card with the camera, before plugging it to the computer. With this simple procedure, the operation of transfering files to the computer becomes safer, as you have a backup.

Spoiler Alert!!Everyone really needs to back off on Stephenie Meyer a little bit. Breaking Dawn was a wonderful book, a perfect ending to an amazing series. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that you just come to care about what happens to each character so much that the book is quite emotionally exhausting, and I don't even consider that as actually bad. It's great. Everyone on here is talking about the "message" the book sends that it's okay to get married, have kids, no college, whatever, by age 18. I don't honestly think Stephenie Meyer meant for this to be her "message." I think she wanted to write an amazing, exciting story about true love that involved characters that people really care about. If there's any message, it's about fighting to make things work for true love, as both Edward and Bella have always done, or the importance of family. And it does not always have to be college vs. marriage/family.  Bella is IMMORTAL, she has her whole life to get a degree if she chooses too. But honestly, she got everything that was most important to her in life--a almost-perfect husband who has made her the center of his world, a wonderful daughter, her best friend Jacob, and all the rest of her family. In the end, I think Stephenie Meyer realizes that these things are the most important things in the world anyway. Everyone is just reading way more into this than I think Ms. Meyer meant for it to be. I actually think Bella grew up alot in this book, esspecially after Reneesee's birth and her change. I love how, in the end, Bella and Edward more equal, and she got the chance to be the hero for once; she had the powers to take care of herself and all those people that she loved. Someone had a problem with Bella getting everything she wanted without having to sacrifice anything? Does anyone actually remember how many times Bella has almost been killed? The pain she went through because she knew she was hurting Jacob? Even though Bella did get everything she ever wanted and some things she didn't know she did, what's so wrong with that?!?! Do we need someone to die for this to be a good book? No. This was the ending I was expecting, the ending I had hoped for, and the way I think things should have all turned out.And Jacob...Book II was really hard for me because I have always really liked Jacob. Even though I thought Bella and Edward were destined to be together, I wanted happiness for Jacob. I completely never saw the imprint with Nessie coming, but strangely enough, it works for me. Everything works out and everyone is happy.  Stephenie Meyer--if you are reading these things anyway, I hope you read some of the good reviews too, because there are alot of people out there who really loved all your books! Thank you for what is probably my favorite books series ever. I look forward to Midnight Sun, (hopefully) all four movies, and anything else you might decide to write! Keep up the wonderful work, and thank you again!

This is good but I want it all. Why is the Discovery version not on HD DVD? The music and narration that I watched and loved is not available in HD outside US TV airings. The fantastic opening sequence and all the behind the scenes from Discovery is not on the BBC version either. Disappointed on these issues. On the upside, the HD Picture on the BBC version is almost Perfect.  If there is any extra footage in the episodes from BCC then I can't recall them.  I will look harder next time.  I will keep my "Pole to Pole" episode locked on my DVR to remember what I experienced the first time.

I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly nave and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.  At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around "repulsor lift" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more. And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!

I've only used the grinder once, and that was to grind round roast to make chili con carne.  The grinder was easy to use and clean.  All of the parts but the cutting knife and the perforated disc could be cleaned in the dishwasher.  A real plus for a device that handles raw meat.     The hopper fed the grinding mechanism easily resulting in an ideal thick grind of meat for this recipe. I used the larger holed cutting disc.  You do have to watch for silverskin membrane or gristle.  It can clog the device, but then you just need to remove the front screw cover, disc, and knife to remove the blockage and continue to happily grind away.  I would not recommend using this device to vegetarians or to the faint of heart. Grinding meat can be a disgusting process even to the recreational meat-eater.  After my children witnessed the grinding-of-the-meat, they are contemplating becoming vegetarians, the desired result!By the way the chili was delicious, but it gave me horrible heartburn.  I do not nold the grinder responsible for my heavy hand with the hot sauce.

It could not be easier indeed! After reding a lot of reviews from different brands and models, I finally made up mind to buy this beast. And boy oh boy, everything is easy! Just plug the power, plug the USB, and you're ready to roll! Just follow the intructions on the screen. What I like about this is it's very quiet. ;) The built of the unit feels very solid and compact. This is exactly what I'm looking for in an external hard drive. Transfering my movies was a breeze. It's fast! Everything was perfect for me! woot woot! ;) I recommend this to anyone looking for anexternal hard drive. I'm extremely pleased.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

I know the movie itself is terrific, but the Seller sold me a pirated copy after telling me it was new.  It worked the first 2 times then after it skipped, or froze up, or wouldn't play at all.  Then a screen came up then I knew it was a copy.  The disc's center [hole] was crumbling and scratches galore.The Seller has shut down his storefront and has disappeared.  "Shutuploli" was his handle and he is in Chicago.  Others had the same problem with him and he does not answer his e-mail.  He was a new Merchant and I wanted to give him a chance. I wrote to Amazon and fortunately they will refund my money after an investigation.If you see that name above,  report him to Amazon and stay away.PS  I LOVE WALL-E!! though.

I needed an easy way to transfer data from one location to another so a jump drive was a good solution.  I needed more storage than some people due to the file sizes I deal with.  I looked at quite a few 1GB, and larger, units.  The price (under $30) was a big plus.  I don't need anything fancy like password protection or biometric encryption so the pny flash drive usb is perfect for my needs.

I like to relax with something fun after a tough day at the office, after hearing all the news about the hurricane, all the news about the terrorism, and all the news about the war. It's always nice to come home to my family, unwind, and enjoy a nice Science Fiction escape every so often. I can't do that with this series. I see from this board that fans of the new series often consider fun shows like the original BSG to be "garbage" and those who don't like the new version to be "live in their parent's basement types". That simply isn't true. I embrace reality. I'm a fan of many older TV programs and do not consider them garbage. I also like newer TV series although this isn't one them. Not everybody considers this to be "a treat". Not liking this new BSG doesn't indicate that a person doesn't live in the real world. They could very well live in the real world and that's why they like entertainment they can escape and unwind with at times. I sure do. New BSG isn't that kind of program. The September 11th elements of this series are bad enough, but that's not the end of it. It then goes on to use the war in Iraq as fodder for what some call "fun" and "a treat" that we should "enjoy". No thanks.

This is my 2nd Drinkwell, and I can't say enough about it.  We had different brand pet fountains in the past, and none of them lasted longer than a few months.  Our veterinarian recommended the Drinkwell, and all four of our cats absolutely love it.  They drink more water now which contributes to their good health.  It is very easy to clean, especially when put into the dishwasher.  When it is in the dishwasher, the cats will sit and wait for it to come out.  I highly recommend this fountain over any other pet fountains on the market.

I bought this when my Network Router went on the blink.  Since I had a DSL Modem with a firewall, I didn't need another router and this product allowed me to connect 5 computers to the switch.  Installation took about 5 minutes and I noticed an increase in speed right away.  I recommend this product to someone that doesn't need a firewall.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I absolutely loved this book. From it's massively devastating beginning, to the fast-paced, action-packed ending. Stephenie Meyer's portrayal of true love gone forever, supposedly, will have readers crying along with Bella and just as anxious as she is to know what became of Edward. And you feel extremely sympathetic for poor, sweet, Jacob Black. He helps Bella so much throughout the story, that you almost wish she would "let him be happy" as she says in the story. But then Edward returns and even though you really like Jake, you really LOVE Edward and you feel as elated as Bella does when they get back together.My point is, Meyer's characters seem so realistic, and have so much personality, so much depth, it's enough to make anyone believe in vampires!

This is a neat little unit, produces what the manufacturer says it will. Just add your milk and add (any plain live culture yogurt will do !) your culture and in the 8-10 hrs you have fresh yogurt. I use mine almost daily to make the kids a good fresh fruit smoothy for breakfast. I love it because I get to control the sugar levels and no preserves or food dye's. the kids love them too. this unit makes a quart at a time which is enough for a nice family meal and reserve enough for the next mornings starter. No complaints!!!

My daughter had outgrown her Carter's sleep sacks, but still needed something cozy at night.  I bought this even though some reviews said it was HUGE, and it fit her just right.  She sleeps much better when she's unable to move her legs around too much.I would reccomend this product to anyone who has a baby that likes to be snuggled in :)

My cat spent 20 minutes at the this water bowl the minute I set it up and turned it on. I used to worry he never spent any time at his little ceramic kitty bowl. Thank you Drinkwell for making my kitty happy and keeping him healthy. (MUCH easier than the blue water fountain bowl by Petmate. My old roommates used to have that one for our cats and I would swear up a storm every time I had to clean that stupid thing. What a nightmare that was with all of it's nooks and crannies that you could never get into. The pieces were a pain to fit together even to fill it. Of course you could never fill it w/o needing to clean it b/c it was always dirty.)

turbo is unnecessary, and there does not appear to be a benefit...vacuum is great addition to product...trimmer setting can change while in use if you push the trimmer too hard against your face...trimmer settings different than previous norelco trimmer (not a good difference)...for my beard, the previous product set on #2 was too close and on the turbo trimmer, the setting is not close enough (#1 setting is too close)...Carrying case is so soft it is useless if you travel and want to protect the product, and the second trimming head...previous product had a cord that plugged directly into the socket...this trimmer has a bulky transformer attached...removal of trimming heads is not easy enough...on occassion the trimming head came off so strangly that it was dropped on the floor...not happy with this product although, as previously stated, the vacuum is really a great addition

Braun says that these blades work with the 8595 that I use. While it's true that the blades do fit and the razor will operate, the level of razor burn is OFF THE SCALE compared to the Activator blades. The best thing about the Braun system is the minimal to non-existent razor burn, an advantage that is completely lost with these. If you use an 8595, avoid these blades like the plague. (Frankly, I would assume that these blades would cause the same problems with other Braun razors, but I can't say for sure since all I have is an 8595.)

Purchased this computer and it began having power up issues within one month of purchase.  It is now DOA in less than 6 weeks of purchase.  Sony website indicates that this power up issue is a "hot topic" for this model.  One wonders if this is a design issue. Called Sony repair.  It will take a month to get my computer repaired.  With 12 mont warranty, a month off is 10% loss in cost of computer.  I need the computer for work and for taxes, but am out of luck for a MONTH.  Likely will be LAST Sony Computer I purchase...perhaps any Sony consumer electronics!

These ultrasonic bark "deterrents" drive my dog up the wall.  He becomes panicky, barks more and does his best to seek and destroy the source of the evil sounds.  I can't imagine what would happen if my neighbors tried this.  Not a good plan for someone else's pups.

Unlike my old 512Mb or 1Gb Lexar jump drive, this 4Gb is of poor quality.  It just feels flimsy and you cannot plug this into the USB port in your keyboard due to insufficient power.  This is a major flaw IMO.  Who want to root around on the back of the computer or monitor all the time?  That's plain annoying.

I was disappointed in this movie. The best parts were shown in the commercials. It was too gory, too vulgar, and too silly for me. I'm glad I watched it alone before I let my 13 year old son watch it. He is disappointed but he will not be seeing this movie for several years.

Like the other books in the Twilight series, the story was creative and interesting and character development was strong. However, those are the only good things about the books. In my opinion, I thought this final book in the Twilight Saga had the most flaws. One example was Bella. I've noticed that she doesn't have any self concern for herself, and it's even more clear in this book. After she had sex with Edward, he accidently gave her bruises all over. Instead of thinking about the danger, she got pissed because Edward's concern for her was ruining her fun. Even worse, she kept begging him for more sex and even wept about it, until he gave in. This showed how selfish she was and how far she would go to get what she wanted. She did not use logic, and all she thought about was sex. She even wanted to postpone the date of her transformation into a vampire because of sex. I guess the author was trying to say that sex is the only good thing about being human. That's a rotten message. So my point, I guess, is that there's nothing good about Bella, and is a bad role model. She was so selfish and whiny, I believe that Edward loved her only because she was the only person whose mind he couldn't read, which made her stand out from everyone else.Secondly, Bella's pregnancy shouldn't have occurred. Stephanie said that vampires were completely filled with venom, so there was no way Edward could have gotten Bella pregnant. This indicated that Stephanie wasn't a good writer, because she was breaking her own rules. Vampires don't even have tears, yet male vampires have sperm? It doesn't make any sense.I also agreed with some of the other reviewers that Bella got everything she wanted without much of a problem. This was unrealistic, because people have to fight for some things in order to gain them. But Bella easily got everything she wanted. A baby, which I already said shouldn't have existed based on Stephanie's rules about vampires (but probably included to make Bella and Rosalie happy) and the ability to have excellent self control and can be around humans. Yes, Stephanie Meyer used the excuse that Bella had better self control because she was aware of the conflicts of being a vampire, but she still would have suffered immense thirst when she became a newborn, which was natural. But no, Meyer made Bella have a lot better self control than most other vampires, so as to make her happy and still talk to Charlie. Like I said, unrealistic. So all in all, I thought this book was a disappointment. It has poor literary value. So if you want to read it, have fun but don't be influenced by everything Stephanie Meyer writes, because some parts are trash.

I have to say this is the best blender ever.  1)It's small 2)It's portable 3)Easy clean-up 4)It's powerful.  I have to say I was very doubtful that this little blender was going to do the job I needed it to.  I make protein shakes twice a day with full-sized ice cubes.  My big Cuisinart duet was too big for just making one shake and had not enough power behind it.  I gave it the ultimate test and put huge ice-cubes and banana in the mix with my protein powder.  To my amazement it made the BEST shake ever.  Not only did it blend the ice and banana into the shake, it made a frothy thick shake that was thick and yummy.  I normally let it blend for about 90 seconds.  The key is putting the correct amount of ice into your drink.  I figured I'd test it out for at least a couple of weeks before I put a review up.  It is still going strong.  I even bought a second one for work.  I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $14.95.  It was the best money I ever spent.  The sippy cup top is perfect because now I don't have to transfer my shake from blender to cup and miss a drop of shake.  The cup top is soft and perfectly shaped so you don't get the "dribble-cup" effect.  If I am running late in the morning I just make the shake and take with me in the car.  It's even good for mixing salad dressings or other wet things together.  I highly recommend this little blender...and I am the most picky person ever.

I recently bought this ice cream maker because of the great reviews!  I thought I was receiving an exceptional product.  However, the very first time I used it, the machine stopped after about 10 minutes as if the motor overheated.  I used it a second and third time and the same thing happened, in fact the stopping became more frequent!  Maybe I got a reject but I am hoping I can return the item as I am VERY disappointed in it.

I bought this because of two reasons. Huge capacity (8gb) and Capless design (Never have to worry about loosing a cap). I really enjoyed using it and really really liked it. But sadly and luckily, it stopped working exactly after 30 days (I bought it from Bestbuy, which had 30-day return policy. SO I at least got my money back although what's stored inside was priceless....!!!) I ALWAYS use safe removal feature of the Windows. I saved all my critically important data and documents, but the device just wouldn't be recognized. Not even a "Device not recognized" ballon on the lower right hand corner when plugged in. It just refuses to be recognized as if nothing is inserted into the usb port!!. Tried every possible way to retrieve the data, but ended up loosing all my experiment data. Should have done back-up regularly. Hope others had a better luck with this device.

Problems right from the start. First, we couldn't get internet on any computer. When we called customer support it took half an hour to get it working. But there was no network security, so we spent another 2 hours setting that up. Then, when I connected the laptop to the network, I kept getting "Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" messages. So we spent another hour trying to fix that. We couldn't. So we tryed to call tech support again, but we never got an answer. All in all, DON'T BUY THIS!!

This is a fantastic camera but people need to have more realistic expectations of what to expect from AVCHD. It is a highly compressed format so using this camera in low-light conditions is going to produce pretty "grainy" results. In good lighting AVCHD output from this camera can produce some really great looking results in HD but don't kid yourself into thinking you're going to get professional HDTV quality. This is a point-and-shoot.I love the camera, especially how fast it focuses in good light, so I'm going to concentrate on what some of the other reviewers said to correct some misconceptions.I use both Macs and PC and I have to tell you that you that PCs suck for AVCHD - you will waste a lot of time and pull your hair out. I'm sure PC video software vendors will address this eventually, but seriously folks if you want to do this the easy way get an Intel-based Mac (caveat: only Intel based machines using Leopard support AVCHD) and use either iMovie or Final Cut Express 4. Both of these programs (iMovie 08 and FCE4) just LOVE this camera (and two other Sony AVCHD cameras I've tried as well) and they work like a charm. Video making has never been this easy.  FCE4 lets you mix AVHCD, HDV and SD video on the same timeline and save in whatever format you want so it's worth the $200 if you want to do that or have more exacting control over your videos. It is basically a (lightly) stripped-down version of Apple's excellent professional video software (Final Cut Pro) and it is very good. For most home videos iMovie 08 (which comes in iLife 08) will be just fine. I've had no problem transferring the movies directly from the camera but, as mentioned earlier, you do need to have the camera plugged into the AC to do it. You can avoid plugging the camera into your Mac to transfer the files if you're only recording on SDHC cards, rather than internal memory on the HF10, but it works just fine. For this reason I would recommend buying the HF100 (over the HF10) and getting an extra 16Gb memory card or two. You will save money that way and have more flexibility. I bought the HF10 because I had to have it the next day and, at the time, the HF100s were delayed a bit. Transcend's excellent 16Gb SDHC Class 6 card comes with a nifty little card reader for only $78.98 here on Amazon, you can get two of them for less than the $200 difference in price between the HF10 and HF100 so you'll have 32gb to work with instead of 16gb for less money. I don't mind having the internal memory as a backup but you pay more than it is worth for it. The video camera is just acting like a USB reader when you connect it to your Mac anyway - it is the file layouts that the software recognizes. When read in and converted to Apple Intermediate Codec at 1920x1080 they will balloon in size. If you want to store the raw video in a more compressed way you can simply copy the root directory of the card to another directory and copy it back again later. If you're working with AVCHD you need to buy the biggest hard drives you can afford. 60 minutes of video will use up something like 50Gb of storage on your Mac when converted to 1920x1080. If you just want great looking home video to show on your HDTV, but don't want to go broke on hard drives, Apple offers to import the movies at a slightly lower resolution (960x540) which takes up a LOT less space with very little drop in quality.  I have been making home videos and showing them on an Apple TV at that resolution and they look stunning. The quality difference between that resolution and full HD isn't that big of a deal.  If want to try to get truly professional-quality video you should avoid AVCHD cameras and stick to the HDV format concentrating on cameras with larger sensors.  But this is great camera for HD home videos at a great price. The user interface on this camera is slow and clunky. Sony's AVCHD cameras have a better interface (using a touch screen) but you can still watch back the videos (which is the main thing you'll do) and it beats the heck out of a tape camera.  I wish they had added a dial or button set for adjust exposure and/or backlighting control on the camera. The joystick works surprisingly well for this however in bright light the screen gets washed out enough that it is hard to tell if your exposure is really that great or not. This is where a viewfinder would really help. But these are minor nits because the camera does a good job at exposure control on its own. As I said earlier this is a very compact point-and-shoot camera that shoots HD video and for that it's excellent.

I am not exactly sure why Stephenie's books are so riveting - there is just something about the way she tells the story - simply amazing! This book is pretty much a downer of a book, yet I continued to turn the pages at a rapid pace, waiting for what I could only hope would eventually happen, and I was not disappointed!As I stated in my review of Twilight, I do not believe these books would be half as good, written by a man. Stephenie is somehow able to pour the intensity of her character's emotions directly into the written word, where you yourself end up directly feeling the agonizing pain or extreme joy, as if you yourself knew these characters personally.If you have not yet decided to read this series, I highly recommend that you do so!!

Purchased the Nano 4g to replace my Nano 2g.  Overall, I like it but it could be better.Pro's:  Nice bigger / brighter display (compared to 2g)  Cover flow is nice  Accelerometer is cool for gamesCon's  Battery life not as good as 2g (probably because of the larger display)  Scroll wheel not as accurate or responsive as 2g scroll wheel (wheel feels like it is made out of flimsy material).   Must disconnect ear buds before connecting/disconnecting dock connector cable because of space constraints.    On Windows Vista, ITunes runs like a frozen t**d.  The folks at Apple recommend you migrate to a Mac to overcome this hurdle.

I had high hopes for the Flip and bought one right before my baby boy's first Christmas. It's easy and no frills. Great stuff. Then I tried to download. It was a mess and the only way out was to reboot. After hours of tries I never got it to work. Finally I checked and learned they had a patch to fix these problems. Only.... the Mac version wouldn't come out until January. OK, it's February now and I found the patch. IT'S ONLY FOR LEOPARD! What? The idea with this camera was to make things simple. My experience was anything but.

I won't lie - I had to convince myself to spend the money for this brush - even after all of the good reviews.  I'm glad I did.I have a pug/chihuahua mix.  You'd think he'd only have so much hair to lose.  But every day, I'd be cleaning tons of hair off our hard wood floors.  I used the Zoom Groom (rubber brush) and it was fairly effective at removing loose top-coat hairs but that's it.  He has a very thick undercoat and I wanted a way to remove a lot of that hair that was going to end up on my floor.First - about the brush - it's very solid and well made.  Comes with a plastic guard to cover the teeth which is great because the last thing you want to do after paying for the brush is to bend them.  Feels well made and not like I just paid to get a cheap piece of plastic so that was good.So!  I held Little Filthy and Furminated him.  I felt like I was sheering a sheep.  I'd run the brush down him in long strokes and a wad of hair would come up on the brush.  It must have felt good because he sat still (no small accomplishment).  I was definitely careful around his sides and legs where the hair is far less dense as the metal comb part could hurt his skin.  I had to convince myself to stop because it was pretty rewarding.  Instant gratification, like mowing the yard.  More and more hair would come out.  I sort of shudder to think that he was going to lose all of that hair on my floor otherwise.[...].Now, I brush the monster about twice a week and I'd say it has reduced the amount of hair on the floor a good 90%.  Overall review:  It's pricey for a dog brush but 1) it works and 2) it is well made.  I'm recommending it to other pet owners.

This fourth book of the series by Stephenie Meyer was wonderful!  I just learned about this series this summer, and finished all 4 books within a month's time!  The story is so intriquing and really puts you in the characters' lives.  I recommend these books for everyone of all ages, I am 25 and seriously enjoyed this series!  I hope Stephenie Meyer decides to continue with these characters' developments in the future for more books to come!

This thing is perfect for the nice fuzz to heavy beard trimming. I've always prefered trimming short than shaving mostly because its easier on my skin and doesn't give me acne. It also sucks up the hairs better than I've ever seen it. With the turbo setting on, I only had 3 tiny hairs that missed the vaccuum. In my impression and with previous experiences, thats the best selling point for this trimmer. No one wants a mess to clean up with.

After returning the Capresso we tried the Zojirushi.  Wow it is so much better!  Coffee stays hot and fresh for a LONG time.  The fill-line indicator is easy to see.  It does take a smaller #3 filter but we push a #4 paper filter in with no ill effects. The only negative is that it is difficult to get a good grip on the carafe cover because it is flat and fairly smooth.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      

Please! DO NOT waste your money buying this moronic drivel. It's all very pretty but it's what Hollywood "entertainment" has become: irretrievably STUPID, dumbed-down eye candy, sound and fury signifying NOTHING. And Nicole Kidman is the reigning queen of embarassing, overwrought, paint-by-numbers "acting". Calling this film BORING would be rewarding this 2 and 1/2 hour load with heaping praise.This movie (I only rented it, fortunately) is SO bad I could stomach only about 30 minutes of it before fleeing in despair that American movie-making could sink this low in its furious quest for a big-dollar ROI. The cartoonish beginning was an early tipoff: "Help! Not anotheridiotic, two-dimensional Indiana Jones clone!" But sure enough....This is the absolute perfect vehicle for a generation that thinks watching "The Simpsons" is time well spent. Toss this clunker into the Hollywood Cultural Sinkhole along with 99% of everything else it foists upon a gullible, apathetic audience. Don't soil your consciousness on this "Zero stars" nonsense. You'll be sorry.

I highly recommend this sharpener! I checked around (a lot) and after reading many reviews I gave it a try. Wow! Super easy, fast and really sharp knives!! Honestly, I can't believe it is so affordable and does this good of a job. This thing goes to town grinding so I don't think I'd want to do it all the time. I have expensive J.A. Henckels knives and they are like new again! Follow the directions exactly because it doesn't take much to really grind these things. I did manage to take out a bit of the beginning of my blade (closest to handle) on one of my knives but this was user error. Just do what the instructions say and you'll be fine. If you have a few older knives that you don't care about as much, I would practice on them first.I will never have dull knives again and slicing tomatoes is a whole new experience - amazing!I am really picky and research everything before buying so if I'm pleased you can feel confident in ordering this.

I've been using Office 2007 since early January 07 and am still struggling  to locate Excel and Word commands that I use to be able to execute in split seconds while drinking coffee and talking on the phone. While some of the deeper functions are now more up front with this revamped format, the side affect is that the top level command interface is now significantly diluted with all the infrequently used features and functions. What really I miss in Office 2007 is no longer being able to use many of the common key-stroke commands, and being able to modify the Toolbar (now called "The Ribbon") interface from within the application.  I really liked being able to customize the toolbars in previous versions of Word and Excel according to my own needs. While previous versions of "Office" had their problems, this latest version, so far, has definitely been a drag on my productivity.

After reading other reviews about toaster ovens in the same price range, we decided on this one and so far we have been very pleased with it.  It toasts evenly and quickly and bakes/reheats well too.  The top of the oven does get very hot so you wouldn't want rest anything on it or have small children near it when its on, but I've found that that is true of other toaster ovens I've owned. I love how the shelf "pops" out when you open it so that you don't have to reach in and risk getting burned.  It does have "odd" oven temperatures but I have found that easy to work around. It could be slightly bigger--4 slices of toast is a very tight fit. The stainless steel look is nice and matches the rest of the appliances in the kitchen.

I've had 2 of these... not because I love it so much but because I had the first replaced. I bought the first one and loved it for almost a year. The brew interrupt (water flow temporarily stops so you can grab a cupful) stopped working but as long as guests knew to wait until the pot finished I didn't care too much. Then one morning I came down to a flooded countertop (piping broke). I called Cuisinart (no easy task) and finally arranged to ship it back (at my expense ((they wanted UPS)) and including a $10 check for a replacement). Cuisinart promptly cashed my check but didn't send the promised replacement. After a month I called to check and was told that they didn't have any in stock. ??? Stores were full of them but the manufacturer didn't have any. I was also told that it was "company policy" to cash the check immediately, but that they had no idea whan I'd receive a replacement. Another month went by and the replacement finally appeared. Yeah. A month later the brew interrupt on the new one stopped working (big shock there ;-) and now I'm loosing so much water to steam that 12 cups of water nets me 7-8 cups of coffee, and time from start of brew until finish (i.e. when you can get a cup without coffee spilling everywhere) has increased from ~5 minutes to 30 minutes. *sigh* I'm looking around for a replacement since the warranty only applied to the original (not the replacement) and I would have to pay for the next one myself. I just know it won't be a Cuisinart.

I've used this 8GB flash drive dozens of times in the very short time I've had it. It's held up perfectly.On my windows xp system it goes a little slower than some flash drives I've used, but the lack of U3 more than makes up for it.On my windows vista system it goes like lightning. I can dump a full 8GB on it in just a few minutes. I could have never done that with my old flash drive.On that note, I had no problems switching back and forth between xp and vista. Simply plug it in and fill it up, then unload it on whatever other system you want.Considering how cheap it is, I don't think you can find a better deal.

SPOILERS:Let me say that I loved Twilight. However, I was seriously perplexed with the direction of New Moon and Eclipse. Honestly there are so many other plots you can concern yourself with then making a love triangle and the various subplots it can proliferate. I really hated it and I was wondering how SM was going to resolve her love creation. This book was about 3 books in one, and it showed. BD was a departure into a bit more adult situations, which is refeshing bc sometimes I was so frustrated with the sexual buildup in the previous books or tweeny situations. Of course SM builds us up again in BD, and the characters finally get to do it, but then thats it, fade to black. Almost as if she did write the whole scene, but then hacked off the middle gooey parts. Even though I know she can't go into the nuts and bolts of sex, the act can be described in a vague way but still thorough. Oh well. I am a Vampire girl. I read Anne Rice, Laurel K Hamilton, encyclopedia of vampires, tons of stuff. There are things you do and things you don't do. Honestly, I was gettting more upset through the series bc these supernatural things were really beyond imagination and just plain senseless. It seemed SM just made up stuff as she went along, and then contradicted herself later on. Bella pregnant? How? Where the hell did this come up before in the other books? So Edward's sperm was frozen for about 80 years till he decides to use it? Her plot devices were grossly oversimplified. And, now Jake imprints on Reneesme (don't get me started on the name). Gee, SM wrapped that love triangle up like a bow. How did I know this was going to happen. Way to convenient and yes just a little strange. But, in truth, BD had more action, and more character development, Bella does think about something besides Edward, Jake or herself. I was happy to see her in a motherly role and let's face it, the powers of her new found vampirism are logical. All in all, it was a fitting conclusion to an ill-conceived series. She should shy away from series whether she does young adult or adult fiction.I would have gone a completely different way, but alas Im not SM.

Alex you have no right to say what you did about Battlestar Galactica. They shouldn't let you haters here. The new Starbuck is the best character there has ever been. Lord of the Rings? Battlestar is better than Lord of the Rings. It's better than Star Wars, or SG-1. So are Desperate Housewives and West Wing. They also aren't science fiction and that's what makes them great. Science fiction is lame and old. You need to update yourself and get with the modern program Alex. Lord of the Rings could never happen. It's just plain bad compared to Battlestar.

I juice pretty much every day, about 2 grapefruits a day. I have had this juicer for less than a year and a few months after buying it, I am ready to trash it. In the beginning it worked fine but now whenever I try to use it, the motor catches and pauses frequently and makes a weird grinding noise before it will start rotating and juicing again. So it takes a long time to juice anything, and the noise is very irritating. I guess to get a truly durable product that works seamlessly, I will need to spend a lot more. I guess this is good if you are not into frequent/heavy juicing.

I upgraded my Linksys 802.11b (which always worked fine) to this "g" model for the improved speed.  I have been disappointed with its performance.  Initially, I noticed it was SLOWER than my old router.  After reading reviews on the internet (which I should have done before I bought it) I learned of many complaints about version 5.  I hurried to my office and flipped over the router and there it was, v.5 on the bottom.  Reading on, I learned about the firmware updates so I downloaded them which helped improve the speed a bit.  Now, the problem is streaming video.  With my old router, I used to be able to watch movie trailers and other streaming feeds.  This v.5 stutters and locks up the video.  If I can't resolve this problem I will likely find another router.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

This is the latest version of MS Office.  If you need it, you need it.  But why would you as a noncommercial user buy this instead of the Student/Teacher edition, which is usually cheaper and can be installed on 3 computers?There are three reasons.1) This package is updatable, where the Student/Teacher edition is not.2) This one is sometimes priced lower than the Student/Teacher edition.  It goes on sale fairly often.  If you have only one computer, get this one if the price is right.3) You want the special media edition stuff.  You get two items.  One is a set of useful but not worldbeating Automator actions that support workflows.  The other is a drag and drop media library/management tool. Both items are nice, but if you have more than one computer, go with the Student/Teacher edition.  One more note:  Office 2008 doesn't support VBA macros.  If your work depends on macros, stick with Office 2004 or get Office 2007 Student/Teacher for Windows and run it under Windows on your Mac.  Macros are supposed to be back in a future version.  Let's hope so.

Potential customers using Windows Vista or XP should be advised that these disks have been preformatted for Mac and will need to be reformatted for the Windows file format (NTFS). The instructions for reformatting the disks are buried deep inside the User's Guide (page 29). What is worse, if you are using Windows XP and follow these formatting instructions, the format will fail. Only the quick-format option (which is not recommended as it will not run a disk check) will work. In fact, neither Windows disk check nor disk defragmentation will work. A workaround for defragmentation is to install another disk defrag software. I successfully tried Auslogics (freeware). The disks are delivered with three sets of cables: (1) USB; (2) 6-to-6-pin (Firewire 400/IEEE 1394a) and (3) 9-to-9-pin (Firewire 800/IEEE 1394b). If your computer (like most PC notebooks) has a 4-pin Firewire jack, you will need to purchase a cable or adapter (costs about $30) separately. LaCie offers support if you register the product. The communications take place through a cgi-bin on their website; they will not call you on the phone. Their attitude has been helpful, which is nice, but didn't solve the technical problem. The bottom line is that LaCie seems to have launched this product fully aware of the existence of this problem, but have chosen not to advise Windows XP users of it. The latest word from LaCie is that they are working on a solution; there is no telling when it will be solved. Until such time that LaCie comes up with a solution, Windows XP users are strongly advised to avoid this product altogether. I will update this review if and when LaCie solves the problem and notifies their customers about it.

The special purpose buttons are preset mostly to media functions (eject, play/pause) and document functions (copy, paste, etc.). Most of the backlighting bleeds between the keys, and the function keys barely light up at all.Basic keyboard functions such as sleep are absent and cannot be added to using the included software. Microsoft's more basic media keyboard has more special keys as well as having five programmable keys that are easier to program.The main defect of the Reclusa is that the extra keys are full size and sit too close to the standard keys, making it easy to hit them by mistake. This was particularly the case with the Eject button which is right next to the numeric keypad's Enter key.The key faces are flatter and some will find this less comfortable.Apart from the USB ports, this keyboard does not have much else to recommend it. I sent mine back for a refund.

Frankly I'm dumbfounded by the positive reviews here. This was pure flimsy plastic junk and I just returned it. It didn't work for me at all. It shaved about 10% of what I asked it to, and no matter how many times I went over certain spots this thing could not hack it. Also, according to the cheaply done instructions, it can be overcharged if you don't unplug it. Hello? What year is this? A little more sophistication please! I suppose if you are accustomed to shoddy poorly made products you'll find this thing acceptable. Definitely one to avoid.

Yawn.... if you think real weddings are boring, try sitting through scene after scene of toasts, smiling kissy face or teary face bride and groom, overly looooong and contrived scenes such as the one involving a contest between the groom and the bride's father to see who can load the dishwasher the fastest-which was only used as a plot device to sneak in a child's plate ( I do not want to give it away) ... I could not believe this movie has been touted as so exceptional. There were some clever scenes but few and far between.We have seen this before- 20 something screwed up misunderstood waif with a heart of gold who does not take any responsibility for herself ..oh yes she is in rehab but merely uses it as an excuse for more pity. Ann Hathaway was OK, certainly better in this than she was in Brokeback Mountain or that horrid Prada movie, but this seems to be the kind of part pretty actresses get raves over- smoke, sulk, have bad hair and smeary makeup, and act out for attention. I do not think it is Oscar worthy but she is the It Girl of the Moment and will probably get the award. Had there been more meat to the story and less blabbering toasts and scenes of partying guests dancing, had the great and underused Debra Winger been able to actually have a stronger role in this movie, especially since she was the pivotal cause of Kym's ( Ann Hathaway) pain, it would have been interesting.  The father was featured way more than necessary... he was a super co dependent which was hammered in over and over. Yea, I got it. After learning about the dad, I wanted to know more about the Debra Winger character especially given that she was so important a factor  I would have loved more scenes with her and actually less scenes with the bride Rachel. Also, whenever Debra Winger was on the screen, man, her charisma and star power is still there, I swear! Hollywood, give that woman another movie to star in would you!? The great stage actress Anna Devere Smith should have been given more to do than smile or get teary eyed, there could have been some deeper scenes with her, how she was fitting into this family, but we did not get deeper with her either. This was a movie that didn't know what it wanted to say beyond the cliches. And a movie that needed a lot of pruning and editing!I will say it was fantastic to see a movie with a multicultural cast, although they were each so earnest and artsy I got the feeling the Lumet and Demme families had gathered up all their indie friends to party. Good music.The movie  had that naturalistic style so many movies from the 70s had, I wondered if writer Jenny Lumet's dad's influenced her ( Her dad is the great Sidney Lumet, which also had me wondering if that was how such a self indulgent script got made into a movie). A huge plus was the cinematography, each scene was completely beautiful, I will say. A visual treat. I did not know beforehand about the handheld camera work and for some reason, I did not get nauseous or dizzy, it really did not bother me, in fact I did like it-The sets were exceptionally captivating. The scenery , the houses were lovely, Connecticut looked magical. Even the gosh-awful toasts and party scenes were made watchable by the cinematography. The wedding cake was spectacular. Fast forward to that part.

I tried 3 different espressos from 3 different sources--all ground for espresso--one even ground extra fine and the espresso pulled came out weak every time, with just a little crema.  I don't know if I got a jinxed machine or what, but it just wouldn't work.  And Amazon just keeps raising the price on the little wonder.  It's gone from $79.99 to over 100.00 over the past month alone.  I sent mine back for a refund.  I might try one from a department store to see if the problem was just the one I got from Amazon.

Replaced my shaver foil and blades - very quick easy work.The foil is the new design, holes aren't just round...more triangular for making it "better for grabbing hair from various angles".  So that was a nice surprise.Made my shave faster and closer.   My first set lasted like two years+.

I love this pedometer.  I have been through at least 20 of the cheaper pedometers.  The doors break, the clips break, they aren't accurate.This one is fantastic.  Since I do my online step recording at work, the memory feature is incredibly helpful.  I don't have to remember to do that right before bed, just pull it up the next day.  It's comfortable to wear (you can even toss it in a pocket) it doesnt' have to be perfectly straight to record properly, and it's the most accurate one I've ever owned.And for everything that it does, the setup is incredibly simple.  This is definitely worth it's price!

Breaking Dawn was such a huge disappointment.  I really loved Meyer's other three novels, so when Breaking Dawn came out, I was first in line...well, not really.  But I did go out and buy it the next day.Meyer has broken a cardinal rule of writing: you can't have it all.  A character with no consequences to their actions makes for a very boring read.  I don't like to see people hurting; but characters just tra-la-la-laing through the novel is dull.There were also quite a few weird scences that I won't completely give up for those who haven't read it: broken bed and weird baby...but that's all that I will give away.It's a must read for thos who have read the previous three books.  But it's not at all like I expected.  But not in a good way.

I bought this as a playpen substitute. It's as advertised, so I don't have any complaint about the quality, but up close it looks even cheaper than it does in the photo. The person who said it looks like a dog kennel nailed it. So if you're looking for something that will go well with the decor in your living room, don't bother with this.The way it looks doesn't bother me that much; what does bother me is that my son, by the age of 12 months, had learned how to push this thing around. It doesn't anchor to anything, so he started to shove it all over the living room, making it tip and generally creating chaos. My solution was to attach those removable non-marring 3M "Command" hooks to the wall and tie coated wire around them, then lash that wire to the play yard. It doesn't look beautiful, that's for sure, but it works; the play yard doesn't budge any more. If your little one is walking, you too will have to jury-rig a solution to their tendency to push the yard around and even lift it if they're strong enough.I also recommend you get those colorful interlocking foam tiles to put under the play yard; it makes the play area a bit safer. Amazon sells the "Edushape" brand, but you can get various brands just about anywhere.All in all, it's not an elegant solution, but weary parents who need a break will love it with all its flaws.

I purchased a new Aspire 5100 and it broke within 8 months of normal use. Dealing with Tech Support was a nightmare. I have, all told, spent over 12 hours on the phone with those people, mostly waiting on hold. First, all repairs are done in Texas and the expense to send broken items lies with the customer. They repaired it, returned it to me, and it had an entirely new set of problems. I sent it back. They repaired it, returned it to me, and on day 89 of the 90 day warranty it broke again. This was on a Saturday when Tech support is closed. I called on Monday and they claimed that the warranty had expired but that they would look at it if I first paid them $400 up front for "out of warranty service" and shipped it Texas yet again.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! BE SURE TO PURCHASE A PRODUCT THAT HAS A RELIABLE AND DECENT SUPPORT TEAM AND POLICY.

Here are two things Phillips will not tell you about their Sonicare toothbrushes and heads. 1) The collar that holds the toothbrush to the handle will disintegrate in a couple of months. That's what prompted this review, because they would not replace mine after it fell apart two weeks after purchasing a replacement. They manufacturer these things to disintegrate so you will continue to buy replacements - planned obsolescence. However, I suspect their China supplier is skimping on the plastic specifications and they fall apart in weeks instead of months. (Do you think China would really do that?)2) UNPLUG your base until you need to charge the toothbrush.  If you charge it up overnight, then unplug the base, the toothbrush will work for four brushings per day for about a month.  Then, when it signals or stops, plug the base in to charge it. This method will allow your toothbrush to work for five years or longer. If you keep the base plugged in all the time, these NiCad batteries develop memory and will stop functioning after 18 to 24 months.A bonus, if you travel a lot as I do, you don't have to pack the charger.  Just make sure it's topped off and you're good for a month's vacation.

I needed a new coffeemaker after my Faberware Percolator (cordless/programmable) died within a year of use. I didn't want to go back to the standard drip machines, because I had gotten used to a really HOT cup of coffee from the percolator.As I searched the internet for a replacement, I came across the new single serve machines. They sounded so attractive, but I was skeptical.  After researching here's why I chose the Keurig B60...-excellent reviews!!!-a HOT FRESH cup of REAL coffee ANYTIME-huge variety of coffee/teas(even organic/environmental options)-hot water on demand (hot choc, teas, and soups, instant oatmeals...)-filter available to brew your own coffee(extra purchase)*other machines  don't have this option*-easy to no clean-up-brewing temp. adjustability-K-cups locally available-time saver(no more washing coffee pot or filter)-NO MORE WASTING COFFEE-3 cup sizes (cup, mug, travel mug)*other machines don't have this option*-time display, and on/off programmable-purchased w/20%coupon at LinensnThings-looks nice on your counter(that's a lower priority, but a nice "benny")-if you like warm-ups you are still able to do that by using a larger mug and just brewing smaller cup size the second time around.There are 6 people in our family from 8yrs-42yrs and all are able to use this machine easily even the hubby : ) WE ALL LOVE IT!!!

I have found this product to be everything it is supposed to be. The balance is good, the reaction time is quick, The wireless controller can be operated from across the room. I have not had any button problems as far as sticking or not responding. Some people may not like the little green light flashing all the time but I find this as a sign that it is working.  I still haven't had to replace the batteries so battery life is as avertised.  In my purchases I have not had a bad Logitech product. I hope it stays that way.

I bought this to replace my aging MiniDV ZR200, and thought that stepping up to the newest format would be a good step since I copy the videos to my computer and then burn them to DVD.  I loved the MiniDV format, but thought that this would be a good move since I could hear the tape motor in the background on my old camera, and with flash there are no moving parts.  Bad idea... I got it in hand, charged the battery for 12 hours and then fired it up and the image quality was terrible.  I have a cheap Canon SD1000 digital camera (Which I absolutely love) that can take short movies, and it blows away the videos I got from the FS100.  Also the five year old ZR200 can record short videos to it's flash card, and that video is again far far better than anything I got with this FS100.  At first everything was good, I could see the wall, floor, etc.  But then my son walked in and asked me what it was, and as he talked and moved around the image ghosted so bad you could not recognize him at all until he stopped moving.  I had bought a brand new class 6 SanDisk SD card for it, so it is the best flash card money can buy right now so that's not the issue. Bright light, dim light, different flash cards from other cameras etc. etc. and still no change. After playing with it for two hours and reading the entire English section of the manual I boxed it back up and shipped it back to Amazon and bought the ZR950 MiniDV camcorder instead.  It's image quality is incomparable to the trash I got from the FS100, and it is $100 less to boot.  The one thing that amazed me the most was walking into my kitchen and simply panning side to side about once a second for a bit.  As the image moved the camera dropped to maybe 5 frames a second at best, and then came back up to a more acceptable frame rate once it stopped, while blurring out everything in the frame as it moved.  Maybe in a few more years they will have the flash format to the point where it can be useful, but it is not there yet.  If you want video quality that is on par with a cell phone or cheap web cam, this is your camera.  If you want a camera to record birthdays and vacations to watch on TV later you will be disappointed.

This keyboard is an excellent keyboard, however not so special for gaming.     -The "G" keys: the G keys are 15 keys on the left side of the kayboard that allow you to program in macros. This is useful for programming, IM or whatever, but really isn't all that useful for gaming; all you can do is type messages more quickly     -The LCD screen: yes, this seems like a cool addition because you can keep tabs of IMs and whatever, but its functionality is limited and uses up a lot of ram for such a small little toy     -The backlit keys: pretty nice, but not that easy to see from an angle. I still think that the powerbook/macbook backlit keys are the best. The LCD screen also lights up.     -Key matrix: The key matrix is the internal brains that says how many keys can be pressed down at a time and which ones can and can't. This is poorly designed because it only allows the W, A, S and D keys to be pressed down at one time, but if you like the arrows or have another configuration, you're screwed for gaming.     -Other stuff- The typing feels pretty good- not a lot of stress and feels comfortable. The two USB ports are nice (although they aren't high powered) and in general is constructed well.      -software: fairly easy to use, however there are only a couple of games where you can monitor ammo that are pre-installed. Macro programming easy.Overall: A great keyboard for whatever you're doing. It doesn't help out a whole lot in gaming, but still has a lot of cool features. If you're a hardcore gamer, get both this and the Wolf Claw Devour FPS Keypad ([...]). They work great  because you can keep track of IMs, whatever, have very easy to use keyboard controls for gaming (wolf claw) and also be able to type to people quickly with programmmable macros.

This product does what it claims to, and I've never had any mechanical problems with it.  Be forewarned, however; for the most part, this machine will NOT work as a mixer and sometimes not in blending applications either.  As a guy in his mid-20's, I figured it would do it all.  No such luck, but it's great for its intended purposes!

I gave this one star mainly to bring attention to a common MBP problem.  My MBP arrived with a dead pixel(s) near the top.  It would have been such a hassle to send it back I figured I would deal with it and maybe take it to a Mac store it became bothersome.  I learned that Apple does not consider this to be "Materially Defective" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.  In all other ways I am very happy with the MBP as I am a convert from Dell.

I decided to step up my game and damage my pocket and purchase an Apple laptop and software. This is because people said this was the ideal if doing video production (and that is my dream). Since getting the thing and installing the software I have had problems. My imovie would not work...i kept having to force quit the programme...i took the laptop software etc to the Apple dealer in the Country and they reinstalled and charged me for this...took the laptop home and now the iphoto keeps hanging up. It seems i would have been better of not going the Apple route as I am yet to get ANY value for the money I paid.

Okay so i was all excited to get my copy of Breaking Dawn on the midnight release. I thought it would be so much better than the other 3. Sadly, I was mistaken, HORRIBLY mistaken.Heres the main thing about Breaking Dawn that pissed me off:WHERE THE HELL IS THE PLOT!?Yes i know it has hot guys, passion, love, sex and all that jazz, but wheres the plot? Around the second half of Bella's book 3, it started to feel very compressed, rushed, and boring. I think while SM was writing this she remembered that she forgot a plot and just started to throw a bunch of things together to make something. It got so confusing in the end, I had to read it three times to get it. Reading it often felt like a chore.Somehow, I managed to finish it and quickly picked up Wuthering Heights so i can completely forget about Breaking Dawn. I was so disappointed, I hyped up and lost like 4 hours of precious sleep for this. Now I'm not saying that SM is a bad writer, (actually her other novel, The Host, is 15x better than the entire Twilight Saga) its just Breaking Dawn, it was just, *sigh*.

After searching a lot of places and reading reviews I decided on this one.  The size is good especially for pizza.  I like the size because it is taller instead of wider like some ovens since the controls are on the bottom instead of the side.  It seems to toast well and cooks well.  The only thing I wish it had was an interior light.  It is pretty dark inside.  The outside can get a little hot but not enough to damage the wall that it is next to on the counter.  The handle stays pretty cool on the door but I still use a mit at all times.  The construction feels tough and durable, not flimsy like the cheaper models.  I have had this for a few months now and it is working great!

Not only does this thing perform like the reviews say,it also is maore than easy to clean.  The price may be a seem a little steep, but the way I look at it is this.  Why buy three cheap juicers that will eventually break, when you can buy a stainless steel juicer that will last you for years to come.  EnjoyChris

I've never owned a yogurt maker before so I don't have too much to compare it to, but I really do like it.  Making yogurt is really easy and being the novice that I am, it still turns out perfect everytime.  I also drain it using cheesecloth to make a thicker "Greek style" yougurt and can substitute this for sour cream.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in making their own yogurt.

The most salient issue I observed in Rachel Getting Married was the complexity of what it means to truely love. We can see the obvious love between Rachel and her finace, the betrothed and their friends, and the father for his children. We are challenged to consider what part forgiveness, guilt and responsibility play in these complex relationships, and how we can better show our love for each other.Rachel Getting Married is an emotional rollercoaster, showing us unparalled joy and destitution, making both more palpable. This movie is sure to enter my list of long term favorites.

This unit performed beyond expectation; I'm writing this on an inexpensive laptop some 50 feet from the transmitter. Setup was unexpectedly simple, thanks to genuinely helpful and instructive step-by-step clearly illustrated guidance (in actual English) from the installation CD. Worked the first time around.Not so good is the companion dual-band USB receiver that is virtually useless with desktops. Don't be fooled by the glowing picture on the box of all-around the house reception. This unit works best with laptops having builtin WiFi capability.Worth noting (and not clearly indicated) is that setup is for Windows machines only. Mac users are out of luck. On-line help is an atrocious 'Catch-22' with no way of email interaction with tech help [try asking for help setting up a Mac]. Overall, an outstanding Windows router - fully deserving of PCWorld's top ranking.

It's a good camera for the price and it's easy to use. The problem is in downloading the files. Files get so big that it freezes my PC (my PC is new and super-fast) if I download all the files at once. I had to download on groups of smaller files to make it work but takes a long time. Also, once you unplugged Flip from the PC, the Flip screen still shows "Connected", and the power button couldn't turn the unit off. I had to remove the batteries in order to shut it down. The problem doesn't seem to go away everytime I download files. It's cheap but I thought I wasted my money buying it.

I've owned this machine for a bit over a year.  I didn't make much coffee until my girlfriend moved in. It's been brewing 1-2 pots a day for the past 9 months now.  When she first tasted the coffee that came out of it (I also use a Braun burr mill grinder), she was amazed.  Better than you can buy at most restaurants.  So, it's saved me a lot of money by just making great coffee here at home.  Slow?  Yes, a bit.  But that's because the water has to stay in contact with the grounds for a while to extract the flavor.  I have a couple of complaints about the coffee maker, however.  The hole to pour the water in is rather small, but once you develop a bit of patience with it and have a paper towel to sop up the little water that my not have hit the hole, it's not bad.  The next is a good feature, but I do get a little careless at times.  The carafe fits tightly on the warming plate and if it's not placed in correctly while brewing, the brewing coffee can spill over the edge of the filter basket when it fills up.  That makes for quite a mess.  But I've only done that twice and the last time was about 6 month ago.  Now I check it if I'm going to pour a cup before it's done brewing.  The tight fit is a nice feature because you know the carafe is place properly and won't leak, but you can't be so lazy as to not make sure it's seated right.  So I've learned.  But I'd buy this one again, and recommend it to friends.

My old waffle iron, circa 1970, took about a half hour to warm up and then about 10 minutes to produce a square 4 piece waffle.  The waffle maker is a big clunker and can be converted into a two part griddle for making sandwiches and other like items which I never used. My new machine is quick - quick to warm up and quick to make a small, round waffle a bit thinner than on my old one.  My Norwegian lady friend likes my waffles so much that I am going to buy her a Cuisinart waffle maker just like mine.

The whole joystick worked well for a short while (2-3 months) until it started going off center.  You can watch it go off center (Windows XP) in the control panel and see what your range of use is without being able to correct it in any way.  The only way to recalibrate is to unplug/plug back in.  Sometimes works...most times doesn't.  Gets VERY jittery and forces you to use a high x/y dead zone.  Throttle and twist never gave me problems.It would be a great joystick if it didn't break so fast.

I'm with an animal rescue group so we have a lot of cats.  Needless to say we loved the original Drinkwell because it attracts the cats over to drink more water.  The new design of the Platinum Drinkwell is even better as far as attracting the cats... however, there are a couple of design flaws which are making these more work for us.  The reservoir cannot stand up independently like the old one.  You have to hold it or lean it against something sturdy in order to refill it as it is curved shape.  Additionally, when we flip it back over no matter how careful we are water leaks out.  The opening to the reservoir and shape of it also do not allow for easy cleaning.  The only new feature we like a lot is the little "gate" in front of the motor area which helps us keep cat hair and fuzzies out.  A plus to any Drinkwell would be if the top of the unit actually snapped into place and could not be removed by the animals.  We find the cats think the top of this is a new toy and they bat it all over the house - we have had to remove it entirely - which unfortunately only leads to more hair / fuzzies being able to get into the unit.  As a rescue we refill the Drinkwells 2 or 3 times a day and while we like the Platinum one because it holds more water the fact that we can't stand the reservoir up by itself is a deterrent.  We won't be purchasing more of them and will probably go back to using the original version.

I am very disappointed with this product.  It is a great concept -- brewing a single serving into a thermal mug.  However, it doesn't work well, at least not for me.  The hot water is expressed very forcefully into the filter basket where the coffee grounds are.  So much so that it scatters the grounds throughout the entire inside of the product -- into the water reservoir and into the brewed coffee.  Cleaning this mess up is a real drag.  You end up with a cup of hot coffee that is filled with coffee grounds.

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      

"Iron Man" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in "The Incredible Hulk.")Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, "Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.So go see "Iron Man."  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, "Iron Man" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.

I am very upset after having the hair iron for three months it no longer will heat up. The red light will come on and off and no longer heats up. I contacted Amazon to exchange for another one that is not defective and they denied to do so. They said that I had to have returned it within 30 days or have a warranty. Well in 30 days it was still working so that wasn't an option. Had I known it would break 90 das later I would have never spent the money on a high end Chi iron. Then I asked about if they even offer warranties for hair irons, they checked with a manager and said no. So how am I supposed to have a warranty for an item they don't even offer one for. Basically I spent $100 on a hair iron I expected to last me years and had it for 90 days, which is as long as a cheap one lasts. I am very disapointed with Amazon and there inability to rectify a a defected product and replace it with a new one. I still think the product is great, my hair dresser uses hers everyday and has had her for years. I think the one I got might have just been defective. What I am upset over it the way Amazon has handled this situation. VERY DISAPOINTED!

I have tried numerous pedometers.  They are very difficult to program.  As I am 50+, technology is not my forte.  This pedometer has large buttons, the instructions are clear, and it was easy to program.  Highly recommended for the technology-challenged like myself.

Outlook with Business Contact Manager is a misnomer. BCM is in reality a bolt-on application that works alongside Outlook with a similar file structure. This would be a fine arrangement except that Outlook and BCM do not integrate together. For example, contacts with the same name in both Outlook and BCM are different contacts and do not share information nor do they synchronize in any way. I use a hosted Outlook Exchange service that keeps my desk and mobile email and contacts synchronized. When I moved a contact from Outlook to BCM I lost visibility of that contact through Exchange and the contact became visible only through my desktop. This is an unacceptable backward step. I just wasted the hundred bucks I spent on the Outlook with BCM application. As best I can tell, the best contact manager/CRM systems are now the web 2.0/hosted applications such as Salesforce, Zoho, Sugar, etc. I suggest using one of them. Good luck.

This is the product I've been looking for since junior high.  I have thick, coarse hair with a strong curl, and no matter how I blow dried it it's always come out straw-like and puffy.  I tried flat irons when they first showed up at drug stores years ago, but they barely made a difference.  Ten minutes with the CHI flat iron and it's sleek, glossy, smooth, gorgeous.  A complete transformation.  And it *stays* that way, for days.  Unreal.  My one complaint it that is gets the hair so hot, I'm burning my thumbs by moving the just-ironed hair.  But it's worth it.  I just wish this thing had been around when I was in high school, so those frizzy haired pictures wouldn't exist.

While I found the software easy to use, I was quite irritated to find (at the very end) that to e-file, I would need to pay $17.95...and an ADDITIONAL $17.95 to e-file my state return!Why on earth did I pay $40 for this software??  I downloaded a free version from the company's website last year.  The purchased version doesn't include much extra.Now I have to print out my return and mail it in, because I'm not willing to spend a total of nearly $80 to do my taxes MYSELF!  I notice now that this fee is buried in the description above, but it certainly is something you'd have to know to look for.  It should be in giant letters right below the price!Irritating.

Unfortunately, Norelco really messed up what they had right to begin with. The length adjustment does not snap into place like my old Norelco trimmer and will shift while you are shaving. If you want to get a clean shave, go ahead and purchase this product, because that is exactly what you will have to do after using it. Disappointing build quality!

I got this shaver as a surprise for my husband. It seems to work really well for him. The vacuum part works really well and doesn't leave too much hair in the sink, and DH gets a nice, even trim. Plus, it's nice to have a comb that varies in height rather than a set of combs that could get lost.

We bought this product, Flip Digital Video camcorder for our sons, aged 35+, as a christams present. We were worried once we had purchased it as both of them have I pods and other camcorders. We had no need to be worried they were both highly satisfied with the gift, it gives them instant access, via the computer or TV,  to the video they have just taken. It is so easy to operate just switch on and point. The quality of the recording is exceptional considering its small size. As we have just said, the beauty of the Flip is its small size, it will fit into a handbag , pocketbook, golf bag, beachbag or whatever you are taking with you. Think how many times you have seen something you would have liked to record in that instant and have not been able to, this solves the problem. Would I reccommend it? in a heartbeat. This is what we call value for money.

When we heard about this blanket, we were very excited.  Our daughter loves to be swaddled, when we get it right - however, the blankets that we have (even the ones that the hospital used to swaddle her) were not very helpful for easy swaddling.  And she works herself loose because she's getting stronger every day.We hoped a blanket cut for swaddling with the velcro would be the solution...However, two problems:1.  It doesn't fit properly and she works herself loose despite the velcro - the velcro contact patches are very small - there should be a broader strip of velcro to attach to so it is more adjustable.   Our daughter is small, and it is just too big on her.  She swims in it.  We hope it will work better when she gets bigger.2.  Fleece - decent winter solution, but terrible in the summer.  And terrible if you keep your house over 60 degrees.  If only it came in a lighter material (we haven't found it).Oh well...  it definitely seems to work for some, so don't use our review as your only basis.THAT BEING SAID, HOWEVER, we now (as of yesterday) use a large waffle weave blanket from Target (~$5) and it works wonderfully...  we can wrap it tight, and she does work herself loose after about 3 hours, but it is better than any of the previous solutions.  We also just ordered the Amazing Miracle Blanket to try (another swaddling blanket), which came highly recommended.One other note about swaddling - whenever she has been properly swaddled (usually by an expert) she loves it...  We initially told some folks who have a lot of experience with children that she liked to have her arms loose.  the response we got is that most babies behave that way, and it really is the small minority of babies that don't really like swaddling.  Now that we know how to do it properly, we would agree.

I love the compactness of this waterpik.  I had the larger one and this one is far more convenient.  You don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model.  Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik.  It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has.  I most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great.

It is simply inconceivable how bad Ooma's customer service is. I signed up at the beginning of January. Two months in, and they still have not ported my primary number (which means I'm paying both AT&T for continued service and Ooma for their so-called premier service). I've submitted more than a dozen emails to customer support and have never received a single response from a human. A request for a tier-two technical support call-back was promised within the hour.  That was three weeks ago.  Since mid-February, their customer support line has either been continually busy or simply unanswered. Their system lets you sit on hold for 30 minutes and then automatically hangs up on you. I tried three successive times last week for a total of 90 minutes on hold only to be kicked off all three times. There is simply no excuse for this. None.   Stay far, far away from this product.

I bought this item when my daughter was 9 months old.  It was only good for few days.  When she learned to stand,  she also learned to climb it!  Her toes fits perfectly on the holes.  I put on her shoes, but then she had a strong grip and uses her hands and pull herself up or hangs on it.  Manufacturer should redesign this item, by making its poles into horizontal like most gates, and not the diamond shape holes.  This product is only good for infants learning to crawl, but not when they learn to stand... and figure out that they can climb it too!  I would say this product is only appropriate for 0-9 months old; those who are learning to crawl; and those infants who cannot stand yet.

This review is from: High School Musical 3: Senior Year (DVD)
      

'Cuz this movie reeks!!  Anyone with half a brain can see that Disney has shamefully resurrected the clichd teenage musical films of the 70's that make real people sick to their stomaches.  At nearly two hours this vomit-inducing garabage heap will only appeal to nave, preppy tweens with nothing better to do than sponge off their parents money or gullable soccer moms, who instead of sitting around with their Hannah Montana clones all day, should be looking for a job.With the innovating title "High School Musical" we follow the same politically correct ensamble of so-called actors from the first two installments into their senior year of high school.  This cast of perfect little dittoheads then sing and dance their way through all the lame problems of their senior year and graduate.Are you sure somebody didn't fart?  'Cuz this reeks BAD!

I have used TurboTax for a number of years. I've never been crazy about its unintuitive interface and limited error checking  -- I had to refile last year because TurboTax did not flag a fairly obvious omission. I never had this problem when I was using a simple spread sheet to compute my taxes. Nonetheless, I had been sticking with it because I had figured out their idiosyncrasies and liked  the tax year carry forward feature. I had even signed up for their "TurboTax Advantage" program where they claim to send TurboTax for " low direct-from-Intuit price" for which Intuit charges substantially more than you can buy it from Amazon or a local retailer. My most recent bill showed a charge of $63.55. I'll be switching to another product, probably H&R Block's Tax Cut which is less expensive and also includes state tax preparation. Failing that, I'll go back to using a spreadsheet. Goodbye Intuit!

The Chi is not for people who have already gotten used to their old hair straightener, especially if the old one is of a good brand. But first-timers will be amazed by the ability of the Chi.Although the box says that the Chi straightens, flips, styles, and curls, all the Chi really does is straighten.It works only slightly better than the regular, drugstore, cheaper hair straighteners.

I would give it a minus star if you had one to check off. It is so slow. I thought I was back in the 15 MHz CPU era. It is only good for copying small files at a time, hence why would I even use a 32 GB for them? I might as well be using a 512 MB drive instead. I went ahead and bought two 16 GB drives instead and they serve my purpose much better.

This movie was so difficult to watch! It was a story I had not heard before so went to the theater blind to see it.  What went on to happen was unexpected and heart wrenching. Angelina Jolie's performance was phenomenal. She made this movie what it is. Without her emotion and reverence throughout the movie it wouldn't have been half as moving as it was. The film was exceptionally well written and equally well shot and directed. The imagery was moving and the shots epic.Watch this movie.

This review is from: Tropic Thunder (DVD)
      

This is one of the few movies that I view multiple times (6 to be precise). Downey steals the show here with his portrayal of the hippest brother ever to grace the screen: "I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude."  Please rent this if you like to laugh. One of the few films that get funnier with multiple viewings as you begin to appreciate the incredible subtleties and genius of Downey's performance.  The guy is simply more black than black dudes! The portrayal is done with taste and I hope it is not offensive considering the legacy of blackface.  It would be a shame if someone was hurt by this film.Downey deserved the Oscar for this instead of Ledger.  It is much more difficult to portray someone when the audience has a frame of reference (a black dude), as opposed to Ledger's obscure portrayal of a psychopath. Ledger had the luxury of playing that role however he saw fit, and we would never know if he was off the mark or not.  If Downey's performance was off, it would have failed miserably.

This drive is by far one of the best designed USB flash drive that I have ever own or seen. I'm an architecture student and I constantly need to transfer drawing and image files rangeing from 100kbs to 1+Gbs between a series of computer; this drives size and acceptable speed deffinately enable me to do this. I need to have a flash drive with me constantly and I have found that the only way that I can remember to bring it with me in the morning after 3-4 nights with out sleep is to leave it on my keys.I also work construction and in the past, most drive that i have left on my keys have only been able to last ~1 month before they were just completely non-functional. Thus I found myself going through flash drives like M&M's.  It is larger than most drives however its about the same length as my trucks key. It is TOUGH. I've had it quite some time now and ever part of it is just as tough as ever. Be aware that "aircraft aluminum" will be very suceptible to cosmetic damage hower i find that i really just gives it a more convicing arugment for its design. It's water proof design allows me also to do my laundry with my keys in my poket witch is also quite a frequent occurance. All of this and it's backed up by a 10 YEAR warrenty. You really can't go wrong with this drive.

This review is from: Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition) [HD DVD] (HD DVD)
      

Transformers has great potential and some moments that show you it could've been so much more than it turned out to be and yet it disappoints by what it mostly is. There truly is more than meets the eye to this film but I don't really like what I see.Transformers falls victim to being another typical Hollywood project that's chock full of the standard thoughts and beliefs of a humanistic, secular and liberal society. Michael bay and company stuffed this film with so much Hollywood fluff that the story about the Transformers broke under the weight of it. There are so many places where this movie goes wrong. First, it focuses waaaaay too much on everyone else in the film except the actual Transformers. The movie is called Transformers isn't it? We're not given much of any story, background or character on the Transformers themselves. There's almost no connection to the old 80's cartoon and the most history we get to see is in the form of a short flashback. They give us a hint of the conflict between Starscream and Megatron but couldn't give anymore because the movie ran so long on human stories. There's just so much time wasted on the human characters that we're not here to see. If you take out Megan Fox and her character altogether, the movie becomes instantly better. I didn't put down my money to see how hot the director thinks she is with the close up shots of her or to see another movie about teenage romance. About them getting to know each other, getting past their differences and falling in love. I really don't want to see it as I really don't care. Sam's parents are annoying and also get more time on screen than they have a right to. Even the soldiers are on for too long. I think there was so much confusion here as to how to build the humans around the robots that they ended up building the robots around the humans. As a kid, I was a huge fan of the cartoon in the 80's and the show did well enough with very little human interaction.Second, it's obvious that the writers and director here are very leftist liberals who are bent on preaching their secular humanism. Here are a few of the things I picked up on. Sam's mother asks if he was masturbating in his room because he had it locked. She then proceed's to tell him that "it's ok" if he was. His parents then discover that a girl was hiding in his room and congratulate him for it. So it's ok for a teenage boy to have a girl alone with him in his bedroom with the door locked? Okay? Then there's a few instances that reflect an anti-government, anti-authority attitude, but then they still remain pro-military as is popular today. Plus a little knock at President Bush, (yeah we know who the voice is supposed to sound like), and it's always popular to mock and insult him. Add to that the fact that the only person wearing a cross is the most unlikable character in the movie and it's readily apparent where the people behind this movie are coming from. Before you tell me "it's only a movie", don't deceive yourself into thinking that the media doesn't promote it's own ideas through it's mediums. Hollywood tells you exactly where it's coming from through t.v. and movies. I also didn't care for the cussing. They could've removed it altogether and it would'nt have changed a thing. The people involved in this movie know darn well that the audience will be a largely younger one. But I guess filthy language and sexuality are also some of our promoted and accepted traits in this country, so here they are. Third, they want to bring the Transformers into our world today but make alot of the people and situations unbelievable. I'd like to never see another movie where "joe nobody's" are suddenly allowed to be involved in a military resistance or are suddenly allowed to see and be included in the plans of top secret, underground, government agencies. Megan Fox's character isn't scared when she first sees a giant Decepticon coming right for her and Sam. She doesn't scream or freak out or anything. Not only that but when she and Sam are being chased by the smaller one, she immediately looks for a weapon to fight it, then does. Come on, are we really supposed to believe this? It's not only her though as it seems everyone wants to be the hero here and has no problem fighting with these giant alien robots that no one knows about. Everyone seems to just jump right into action. Like the earth is populated with superheroes. And they make Optimus Prime our biggest cheerleader. He's full of comments of how great we are and how they need us and couldn't achieve victory without us. Since when did the Autobots ever need us?Fourth, They only got one of the original voice actors for the Transformers themselves. You could pull it off without most of them I guess but they should've got the originals or at least sound-a-likes for Megatron or Starscream, as they had classic and recognizable voices. I'm glad that they got Peter Cullen to reprise his role as the voice of Optimus but he should've been able to also do Ironhide as he used to.Fifth, the product placement went to a new level of shameless with the cars and just about everything you see in the film. They could've used some clips of the movie for commercials.Sixth, there are some moments here that just feel juvenile. The teen moments in school, at the park, with the parents, and the rock music on two of the action chases feel made for a teenage audience. Even as a young adult, I found them hard to sit through. And don't even get me started on the lame dialog. There's not a smart or insightful spoken word throughout.The things I do like here are pretty obvious. I like the action, the graphics and the Transformers themselves. When they're on screen, the movie is alot more interesting and it makes you just want to see and learn more about them. Why didn't they just start the film with their war on their world, instead of just a flashback? It would've bee so much more interesting. This really should've been a straight up, sci fi action film. I accept the new look of the robots and the transforming animations are incredible.Which brings me to the disc itself. I have seen both the standard and HD DVD versions and there's a pretty noticeble difference between them when comparing them. They're both very good though and your gonna be fine with either one you choose. The standard disc still looks and sounds very impressive. On a good t.v. and home theater, you won't feel like your missing out if you don't have the HD version. If you want the HD DVD version, which will be the same when it's released it on Blu-Ray, you'll want to have a very good HDTV and sound sysytem to make you happy you paid the extra money. It looks and sounds great to be sure but not so much that it makes the SD version look and sound bad. The 2 are actually pretty close and will equally satisfy.I really wanted to like Transformers more than I do. But the things that bug me, really bug me. So much, that I find myself skipping through the slow, human story parts to get to the better stuff. That's not good. I don't own many, if any movies, where I have to do that. Those parts just bog the film down, make it longer and make it feel alot longer than it is. I hope they do better with the upcoming sequel, I don't think they will but here's to hoping. I give this one 2 stars for the effects studio who provided the excellent graphics and battle sequences, without those, it gets no stars. If you want a movie about uninteresting, stereotypical people (spineless loser guy, losers "cool" parents, ex thief/mechanic super girl, hip teen hackers, soft hearted military heroes, "evil" government) in unbelievable situations, sprinkled with some sci fi action in the form of robots, then you'll be happy. If you want sci fi action, something like the cartoons you may remember, and a smart and challenging film then your gonna struggle here. If your not a lefty liberal, looking for another celebration of secular humanism, your gonna struggle even more. If those things are a concern, rent before you buy.

I have used Braun shavers for over 15 years and I have loved them. Until now. After 4 years of great service my 7500 series Braun broke. With a track record like that, I was definitely buying another Braun. I figured a razor is something I should spend extra on since I use it every day, so I bought the very pricey 9595. I have come to regret it. It became clear early on that this one wasn't as good as the one that it replaced. After 3 months of daily use, I'm very frustrated and rather angry. - Noise. The pulsonic razor is really noisy. Much noisier than the 7500 series.- Recharger/cleaner is very poorly designed. Rather than using a direct plug in connection, it has contacts on the razor and on the base that need to line up. This works until the razor starts cleaning, vibrating the razor. This causes it to lose connection and stop working. It normally takes four tries to get it to complete a cleaning cycle. There is no correct way to insert the shaver to guarantee it will complete  cleaning cycle. - Less information is less information. The old 7500 series told me how long the shave took and how much charge in minutes were left. The 9500 series has cell phone type bars for power and hygene, no read out on time taken to shave. After using this razor for 3 months, I think they removed the time taken to shave feature for a reason. - Takes too long to get all the missed spots. It takes 50% longer to get a good shave than with the 7500 series. - Excessive packaging. Packaging has no influence on those of us who buy through the Web, but I will note the packing is excessive and wasteful. - Gimmicky. I have noticed no benefits of "sonic" over a regular electric razor. After another time consuming shave and three attempts to get the razor to clean itself, I called customer service. They weren't very nice and wanted me to ship the charger to another city. Thanks for nothing. I have gone from a loyal Braun customer to someone who will never buy another Braun (or Proctor and Gamble marketed) electronic product. Update: I still hate this razor and the shaves have gotten even worse. It takes forever to shave with this thing. It is the worst shaver I have had in 18 years of shaving. I can't believe I paid over $200 for this POS.

Read the other reviews and you'll notice a trend. My controller lasted about one month before the right analog stick got uncallibrated. It makes my one game, MVP Baseball 2005, pointless since my players just dive around the field all day long.What's sad is that this problem has been occurring in these controllers for over 3 years and they still keep on selling them. (Too bad I didn't read the reviews first.) Knowingly selling a defective product should be illegal. Shame on you logitech! Shame on you!

I'm a CA CPA who worked for a Big 4 Accounting firm.  I now work in Corporate Finance at a High Tech company.  I've been using TurboTax for about 10 years for my personal filings.  The software is good.  However, each year Turbotax tries to find a way to charge you more money.  You can't finish a return without getting asked at various points to spend more money.  Most of the "in software" sales tactics are taking advantage of consumers' fear of taxes & the IRS.  It makes people think that the software is a magic box.  The more you pay.  The more rock solid your return would be.Further, telling consumers that they get federal and state returns and free e-file sounds good.  But, in the 2008 version, you have to pay for Sch D usage.  You have to pay for Sch C.  You have to pay to e-file state returns.  You have to pay for a 2nd state return.  They originally had you pay for printing your return.  Hidden fees are everywhere.  The idea that the various schedules within a tax return are separate is ludicrous.  It seems like the price you pay for the software is just the start of a bait and switch scheme.I actually have recommended TurboTax for years to co-workers and friends.  No longer.  I'm taking my business elsewhere.  I'm making a complaint to the BBB.

Although many years ago I was a raving fan of Intuit, since 2004 I found like each new release of Turbotax and Quicken less and less.  It's obvious they have prioritized revenue generation over customer satisfaction and only respond to customer revolts.  I just switched to TaxCut for the first time and am quite delighted.  Also, here's tip for those of you forced to do the Quicken upgrade you don't need or want.  Instead of buying the latest version from Intuit, just go online and find one of the earlier "obsolete" versions.  You can usually find them for $10 or less plus shipping and avoid paying Intuit.

I have 3 TB external drives which I use for TV recorded shows from cable.  I found that if you buy (2) TDK 100 lot spindle DVDs and the 200 plastic cases you almost reach a point where the cost is equivalent to the cost of the cheapest TB externals available, either from NEWEGG.COM or Amazon.Com.  I'm lucky if 200 DVDs are enough for one month of recording because I have to use the externals to hold the copy protected shows and try to transfer over the other saved shows to TDK 2.5 HOUR DVDs in an ASAP manner.  I have two LACIE and 1 IOMEGA and actually cannot tell any difference among them.  When they are formated, the formatting seems to take up quite a lot of space.  And buy units with an on/off switch.  I have noticed on my computer if I have all 4 externals running (includes 1 Maxtor 320GB which I use for gaming) plus have a lot of other USB stuff hooked up, you will occassionally get the blue screen on bootup which is required when your computer goes bonkers.  I would buy just the cheapest TB's unless you have lots of money or want to feel safer if used as backup units.

From the previews we were hoping for something upbeat and maybe even Chi's jumping and singing as warriors or something... It had almost nothing in common with the theatrical trailer.I didn't watch it with kids, just my Wife and myself (who both love Disney movies!). We had to turn it off about 3/4 through. We just couldn't take it any more. It does not feel like a theatrical Disney flick, and is even subpar to many of Disneys straight to DVD films.Buyer beware, I'd strongly suggest renting this one first.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

I agree wholeheartedly with Richard O's review, modern "Bread and Circuses" for a morally bankrupt society. Trifling entertainment for 30 year old children who are too brainwashed and fascinated with digital junk to look around and see that Rome is burning. A great cast of actors who obviously needed a quick buck. Christian Bale should go back to making real movies like "Rescue Dawn" and "Empire of the Sun" movies that mean something, movies that portray ordinary people in extraordinary situations. In other words REAL entertainment that does not involve digital explosions and shootout after shootout. I can't believe this movie rose to the rank of number 2 grossing movie of all time! It saddens me to think of a nation and a world that eats this garbage up, beating out movies like "Star Wars" and "Lord of the Rings" which portray real heroes. Batman got old 15 years ago, at least "Superman" was super, all batman has is money, but hey, we are a nation that worships money.

Pros: -the video converting software was simple enough-videos were clear, once in a while some graphics got distorted in a small part of the screen but that might have been due to the quality of my videocons:*-I am partly returning this player because the lowest volume setting is not quiet enough when I am indoors. It starts to hurt my ears. I lowered all of the EQ settings, and tried various EQ settings but, it was still too loud, and it lowered the sound quality. It was also perhaps too much treble. I tried using a few different headphones and some were able to reduce the treble a little. But, the difference was not good enough for me. It seems like there a few other people out there who had the same issue if you look on the sansa fuze forum official website. I would invest in the headphone volume control if it were not for the fact that I realized I also would just prefer a smaller mp3 player. In comparison, the ipod shuffle 2nd generation has less "treble", and therefore easier on my ears. I can not remember which had the better sound quality.

Ordered this MP3 player to replace my 512MB Creative Nuvo. The SanDisk does all the basics just fine. Easy to use. I never even opened the instruction book. Comes with a USB cord, cheap earhpones, an armband, and a very flimsy case that only works with the armband. I recommend the silicone case (+ $8.50). I do like the large, easy to use buttons. I'm able to use them while running, with gloves on, BUT....One complaint of the player: It is WAY to big and bulky and cheap feeling. It is like a Playskool or Fisher Price MP3 player. Look at the picture of it. See how it looks nice and uniformly flat? It isn't. The back is a huge semi-circular form that adds another inch to inch and a half to the thickness. SanDisk only shows this edited photo for obvious reasons...they are definitely attempting to obscure the true bulk of this player, which is substandard compared to similar products on the market. It will not easily fit into a pocket or slim space, which is a major disappointment for me.

This is a bad movie based on an excellent comic book.  It's a great example of the problems that arise when you try to translate one medium into another.  Still, it has its charms, and it means well.  I gave it two stars, because the film is a fun way to kill ninety minutes, especially if you have some friends over and give it the Mystery Science Theater treatment.  I recommend following it up with some Challenge of the Super Friends DVDs for a night of complete grade Z kitsch.  Take it from this "hairless ape", you could do a lot worse!

**SPOILERS** I was really excited for Breaking Dawn to come out.  I mean REALLY EXCITED.  So like a good Twihard I got my book right at 12:01 and stayed up all night to read it straight through.  The beginning was pretty good and seemed to flow with the style of the other twilight books.  I liked the wedding, but after that things started to get weird.  The honeymoon wasn't terrible, until Bella got preggers.  I was like WTF?! but I went with it, trusting steph to explain this so it made some sense.  Well, I'm still waiting for that explantation.  Then all of a sudden it switched to Jacob's POV.  I really didn't want to switch at first, but I quickly warmed to Jake's POV.  I liked learning more about Leah.  That, however, like so many things in this book turned out to be a dead end and complete waste of my time.  Because guess what? As soon as that demon child is born...Jacob imprints on her.  So the one character left who I could relate to goes over to the dark side and becomes unrecoginzable just like everyone else.  My other WTF?! moment was when Bella told everyone what she was going to name said demon.  Renesmee Carlie.  Please tell me that that name is some kind of sick horrible joke gone wrong.  It was just so tacky to combine everyones name like that.  I actually thought the Cullens had some style and dignity.  My bad.  Next thing we know Bella was a vampire.  This part of the book was okay.  Until I find out that Bella is basically perfect.  How am I supposed to relate to that?  Then we are introduced about 800 new characters near the end of the book.  It all builds up to what is supposed to be an awesome climax to the story.  Which ends up dragging on forever and nothing actually happens.  Great, everyone is perfect and none of them even die to even things out (although I am not sure I would've cared by this point because I'd kinda started disliking/hating everyone by then).  The End.  Wow.  It took awhile for it to sink in how much I really hated the book because I just felt a little numb for about the next 24 hours.  Then it slowly sank it and I started fighting the urge to burn the book. Instead I started writing really long rants (sorry btw) on the internet. The horrid and boring plot totally took over the characters.  They were constantly OOC.This book doesn't even seem like it was written by SM.  So I have a few theories about that.  Theory #1 She was smoking somethin really strong the whole time she was writing.  Plus she got the stuff from her editor who also seems to have been delusional during the production of this book.  Theory #2 The Host is not actually a fictional book at all, but rather a true story.  Stephanie was taken over by an alien who had no idea how to write, but felt compelled to still finish the series.  Theory #3 Stephanie felt rushed/pressured to finish the book.  She couldn't think of anything so she just copy and pasted a bunch of crappy fanfics to make up breaking dawn.Also for all of you out there who were throughly disappointed by BD we have a facebook group.  It's called "Is it just me, or did Breaking Dawn suck like a newbornd vampire on a human?"  ALL BREAKING DAWN HATERS, WE MUST UNITE!!! so join the group already, sheesh.Sorry agian about the length.

I bought this product with great hope and anticipation. I read the rave reviews, and I believed. Boy was I disappointed.    Prior to purchasing the Bodygroom, I shaved with standard WAHL professional clippers, followed by a straight edge razor. Yes, a straight edge razor, by far the best shave you can get, but you have to be extremely careful, and thus it is very, very time consuming. BUT, the results are outstanding. (On a side note, have your wife/girlfriend do it. It can actually be fun and erotic.)   The concept of the Bodygroom sounds great, but the actual results do not even come close to the expectations. The small clipper blades would simply get clogged and would not cut the hair. I needed to run the shaver over an area multiple times before I say any results, and those results pale in comparison to the method mentioned above.   In fact the results are just plain bad. How bad? Norelco does have a 60 day money back guarantee, and I plan to return it immediately.   As far all the raving reviews... I'm beginning to wonder if they are being paid by Norelco to post them.

I was happy with it for less than two months, and then the keyboard failed. When I press a key, several characters come out. I was on hold for customer support for more than 20 minutes once, and more than 30 minutes a second time without getting to anyone on the other end. Online tech support is a joke, as the tech support staff kept cut-and-paste the same text telling me to call that number. I had been using Dell for the last 10 years, and thought this small, inexpensive PC would be good to browse Internet in the living room. Big mistake! I will be more than willing to just forget about the warranty and pay for a replacement myself if there is a place to purchase one. But, I am not able to find one yet. My Eee PC 900 is now collecting dust. I don't think ASUS is ready for prime time...

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

I am making the switch from a traditional blade and shave-gel to electric shaving system with the Philips Norelco 8240XL. Based on my experience a few years ago which left me with irritated skin and ingrown hairs, I was not expecting much. After a few weeks of use, I am pleasantly surprised. No skin irritation or any more ingrown hairs than I get with traditional shaving. Pluses: It is easy to use and much faster than traditional shaving. After using it, it is very easy to clean using the included brush. The kit includes a small charger (no bulky transformer which makes transportation easier) and a collapsible case. I appreciate the case versus the hard case I had with the shaver I used a few years ago; the form factor for storage is convenient and thoughtful.Minuses: 1. It leaves a mess. Every time I shave the counter is scattered with little hairs. Rather than gathering them up in a lather like traditional shaving or keeping them inside (which would require more frequent cleanings), the 8240XL seems to just spit the little hairs all over a 3 foot diameter. It, therefore, requires a little more cleanup than traditional shaving and is not as good for shaving in the car as I might have hoped. 2. Not good for long hairs. It is very effective at clipping off day-old hairs. As hairs get longer it tends to miss them. This is a self-perpetuating problem. If I shave quickly and leave a few stragglers, there is a lesser chance that these will be clipped off tomorrow than the shorter ones. After a few days I have a few long hairs among a well-shaven face. At that point, I give it a run with the traditional razor which takes care of it. Likewise, if I skip shaving for a few days between workdays, it is pretty much useless, very slow, and somewhat more irritating to my skin than traditional shaving. That said, if I'm careful to do a thorough job each morning without skipping days, the 8240XL is very effective and quite a bit more time-efficient than my old method. Understanding its limitations and maximizing its benefits, I am happy to make daily use of the Norelco 8240XL supplementing it with traditional shaving at times. Especially considering the low price point, I would recommend the 8240XL with some cautions to those considering it.

I am so happy I ordered this.  I have known about Tracy for some time and after seeing her on Oprah was pleased to see there are DVD's available.  It is only Tracy doing the workout, which makes me feel more like I have a personal trainer.  Her directions and comments are appropriate and the music corresponds well to the moves.  The changes can be quick but with repeated viewings, I don't see a problem in picking them up.  It's much more graceful than any run-of-the-mill workout.  In fact, I would go so far as to call it "purposeful movement" rather than exercise.  I can definitely say it's something I will look forward to doing rather than dreading.  Also, there isn't a lot of babble and bubbly encouragement, which I'm grateful for.  I can't imagine a muscle that isn't worked during this routine.  It is a challenge and if you're just starting out, just do what you can and work your way up to it.  It will take me some time to be able to do it as effortlessly as Tracy does.  The contents of the Disc are: Mat Intro - 1:02, Mat Workout - 57:28 (Includes warm-up and cool-down), Gwyneth Interview - 0:56, Tracy Interview - 2:56.  You need a basic mat sized area, mat if you are on a hard surface, 3 lb weights and a chair. It starts with warm-up then standing legs, standing abs, standing arms, standing arms with weights, mat legs, mat abs then finishes with cool-down. One caveat - During the floor ab work, make sure that your hands are simply supporting your head or there for placement rather than lifting it.  She does keep a distance between chin and chest and mentions it, but if you're not familiar with the move, it may appear that she is lifting her head with her hands a bit. Lifting the head rather than the upper body won't target the proper muscles and more importantly can cause neck strain or injury.  *I don't think there is any further instruction needed, the moves are simple & basic but the combination and amount is more than effective.

I was really impressed with this unit when i first got it. I tracked my steps for about 9 months or so before the battery died. I changed out the battery thinking that i could go back to tracking with no problems. Unfortunately I was wrong. Once the battery was changed it couldn't store the time and ran slower then it should have. It now sits on the shelf in my bedroom, not tracking anything but dust growing on it. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great pedometer while it worked.

The reason I'm giving this product 1 star is because it came to me broken. And not only that, but I exchanged it for another that had the exact same problem! I talked to LaCie and they've been receiving a lot of complaints. A bad batch went out, so you have the option of sending it to LaCie for a repair. However, the guy at LaCie really sold me on the 1TB Quadra model. He said the Big Disk Extreme is a little faster, but the Quadra is half the size and one drive--making it easier to recover information. The Big Disk Extreme is two hard drives, pretty big, and if some thing breaks, you may be kind of screwed. I was able to talk them into shipping me a Quadra instead of repairing my broken Extreme. If I were you, I would just go with the Quadra (unless you need the extra speed). I'm completely satisfied with its performance.

It was a fantastic movie for Batman, the Joker and the D.A., and Batman's ill-fated fan-girlfriend. However, either the theater employees turned up the volume on the music, or the music track played way too loud so that the dialogue could not be heard. What was said at the end of the movie was lost in the loud music. The loud music ruined hearing the last words. I hope that the last dialogue of the DVD is not spoiled like it was in the theater. (Repetition for emphasis) I may rent The Dark Knight first, before I buy it, to make sure that the dialogue is not overpowered by the music score.

My partner and I juice oranges and small red gratefruit daily for breakfast, and this juicer works great for about 2-3 weeks, until which time the motor either burns up or the plastic gears strip out. We've had 6 of these, and the last one just stripped out this morning. Black and Decker outlet stores are very nice about replacing them, but I'm tired of it, so I came on line to search for better products today, which is what prompted this review. Too bad, because if it was constructed a little better, it would be a great compact juicer. Cheers, Gary

Yesterday 1/31 Taxcut was $33 to download.Today 2/1 it is $41 same as the box set at local stores.Between Taxcut and TurboTax I'm so confused about what is included (state/no state, number of free downloads 1/5, cost to print additional filings) and now COST $$$$. I suggest we all boycott both TurboTax and Taxcut this year for making such a mess of things. While I'm on my soapbox,  why does the federal govt even charge us to make it easy for them by e-filing. Second why isn't tax software FREE from Uncle Sammy. Oh I forgot it is to the so called poor. Hell with all this, I think I'll go back to handwriting on govt supplied tax forms. Assuming they aren't charging for them at the post office to pay for all the bailouts.If they didn't owe me this year I think I would just skip filing all together.

I read the manufacturers product description and it sounded just like what I was looking for. "It works with virtually any device with a USB port - even cross-platform from Macintosh to PC and vice versa." When I received the drive, however, it wouldn't work with Mac OS 9.  I am running OS 10 but a lot of the files I wanted to back up were created with OS 9. There was no information on the  web site about supported versions. My OS 9 files were not recognised. I was understandable upset. I contacted Kingston for support and was give a tech solution that was not guarented to work and a disclamer:"If these steps do not work for you then unfortunately there is nothing else we can do for you."So much for their "five-year warranty and Kingston's legendary service and support."The steps didn't work and I am not able to back up the files I need so I guess I am out of luck and Kingston is out a future customer. Lose. Lose.

With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. (Good Night, and Good Luck). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws. You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (Tideland), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost. We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, Proof), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue: Stark: "Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest..."Jimmy: "We can talk, sir." Stark: "Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright."Ramirez: "You intimidate them, sir."Stark: "Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."Ramirez: "I'm an airman."Stark: "Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?"This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title "blockbuster." And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.

This graphic novel is one of the best novels I have ever read.  The non-linear story telling keeps things moving and it never gets dull.With every page comes a new twist to the story, but no cliff hangers.  Everything is wrapped up in the end and makes sense.Even if you are not a fan of comic books, you could easily get sucked into the Watchmen Universe.

So far I am quite pleased, although I am still experimenting with its use and operation.  Can't understand why when the videos are emailed, many complain that they can't be opened.  Still trying to ascertain whether this is the fault of the email service of the recipient, or a problem with my mailing.  Still learning the unit, but if it does all I expect it will, I'll be quite happy.  Ask me again in a couple of months.

I've been a Quicken user now for just about ten years and use it to simply track my checkbook and investments.  It does what it's supposed to, however...The graphics rendering capability is absolutely pathetic.  Some of the investments I track have to be entered manually so I &lt;ALT>&lt;TAB> between Quicken and the website that contains my prices.  Switching back to Quicken takes about 10-20 seconds for the window to redraw properly.  With a half-dozen different investments with high/low/current pricing to manually enter, this takes a long time!  Opening the calendar will take about a minute for it to quit redrawing everything.  My computer is no slouch on the graphics side.  If it can handle 1920x1200x24 World of Warcraft gaming, it should handle pie charts pretty easily.  Not when Quicken is doing the drawing!  After _finally_ getting a response from customer service, they said the only solution was to disable ALL of my graphics hardware acceleration.If I can find another home financial package that will import all my historical data, I'd jump ship in a second.  Save your money and look elsewhere!

I work in the computer section of a mid-sized printing company, and I also do a lot of web work on the side, so I see a lot of different, and at some points odd) ways to store media.I bought my external 250 drive a few months ago, along with 9 disks to go with it... all of which (drive and disks) are sitting on a shelf collecting dust.This drive does not work well personally, or professionally, whether you want to reuse it a million times, or store important back-ups.  The disks are not dependable enough to rely upon to keep long term back-ups, constant use corrupts the disks, and forget about sending them through the mail!  No matter how careful you are in packaging them, chances are you'll get a few back with messages saying &quot;I can't open most of the files, they've gone bad&quot;.Buy a CD writer, test your CDs before you give them to someone else, and you won't have any problems, mail them... step on them... pour some soda on them... as long as you don't play hockey with them, or melt them, you'll be OK.

My USA-19HS worked ok for a couple of months, then stopped working. It started identifying itself as a a TUSB3410 Boot Device, which Keyspan's website says meant it was defective. I then went into customer service hell. After I posted my info to a tech support forum on their website, they vanished. I poked again a week and a half later, and they came back and told me to mail the device in. I did so. Then they vanished off the face of the earth. No replacement sent to me, no posts to my electronic tech support thread (despite multiple posts by me), and they don't answer their phones (there's a recording saying to visit the website). Eventually, weeks later, after I threatened to go to the BBB, someone posted and said they'd look for my device and get back to me that afternoon. Two days later, nothing again.The device works fine, but heaven forbid you actually need to get it replaced. At this point, I have neither my dead device nor a refund -- I mailed it in, and it's gone in a black hole.

I finally replaced my old broken waffle iron(Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle) with this one thinking I was getting roughly the same iron.  The quality has fallen off greatly : 1.  The browning controller literally fell off with my first wipe2.  The plates don't have enough clearance and the waffles come out with holes.  I use a very think batter, this is a serious design flaw.3.  The heating element shows thorough on the waffle i.e. there's a cook ring within the waffle - looks really stupid.This thing is not the waffle iron to buy and it's the second terrible Cuisinart waffle iron I've tried.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice............

Just got my B-40 elite and I love it. We have the largest office version at work, and it is awesome. I was a little scepticle that the B-40 would seem "cheap" compared to the office version, but I was pleasantly surprised. This machine seems to very nicely designed and built. I would have to say it weighs around 30 lbs. I have owned probably a dozen different coffeee makers of all types and brands and they always seemed flimsey and cheaply made. Not the Keurig - very nice. As for the operation it is awesome. Super easy to use and very convenient, since there is virtually no clean up. The machine I got has two sizes. The large size fills a standard coffee mug right up to the top. I like having the option of the small size, if I am in the mood for a really strong cup.As for the coffee, I rate it very high. This makes great coffee and the variety is tremendous. In my opinion the Senseo makes a better cup of coffee, but the Keurig is not far behind, and the Keurig outshines the Senseo in ease of use and clean-up. I had lots of problems with the Senseo machines as well. My hope is that the Keurig gives me 1-2 yrs of use.I definately recommend this machine - you won't be disappointed.

After preparing waffles all by himself in the "breakfast room" at a Washington hotel this summer, my son decided we needed a waffle iron at home.  I found this great little waffle iron - very easy to use, fast, and clean.  The waffles were delicious and came out perfect every time.  What a switch from those horrible frozen things!  However, this AM just after the last waffle was cooking, the iron died.  We have had this waffle iron 6 weeks!!  Bed Bath & Beyond was gracious enough to replace the iron.  What's the deal Cuisinart?  I thought I was buying a good product!  When this one dies, I'll buy one from another manufacturer.

The device has the functionality as other people have covered and is in the product documentation.  However I found its support of the 5GHz band is too flaky to be useful.  Everything on 2.4 is fine.  (Using latest B17 firmware).On the 5GHz band you are fine if doing light web browsing etc, but about 5-10 seconds after you transfer bulk data the connection dies for about 60 seconds (confirmed using perfmon, wireshark and pings).  For example copying a movie file from a camcorder starts at high speed and then fails.  Doing the same thing on 2.4Ghz doesn't result in any issues, but is half the speed of 5Ghz and makes having a dual band device pointless.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      

Well, enough has been said about the movie and most of us already know what it is. I just want to add to the rant of all the collectors here that this two-disc edition is a big, big disappointment. Is this all they could come up with for a film which was such a big critical and commercial success? A few lame extras and a digital copy?? Duh. Well, I held back buying this release, hoping that there will be a real special edition sometime soon. I know the publishing house is going to milk the fans dry with this one and I refuse to be a vicitim. In case, you still can't hold on, my advise would be to go for the single disc edition and save some of your hard earned money.

The monitor itself was great for about a week and then it froze up and the watch did nothing.  I called Omron and they said that the battery was low and that it must have been on the shelf at Amazon for quite a while and so it got low because Omron put the battery in at the plant.  So...I had to go to a jeweler (because it is sensitive and waterproof and they said not to trust a discount store clerk) and have a battery put in.  I am disappointed that this is not covered by any warranty.  I am disappointed in Amazon for sending out old equipment.

We love the fondue pot.  Love the sharp chrome look.  The only drawback is that the inside is harder to clean without teflon.  Leftover cheese or chocolate just slid off the teflon in our old Rival Fondue pot.  It's probably healthier for us without the teflon.

My cat really dug his kitty fountain but my overall experience with this thing was kind of bad.  Yes it recycles the water a bit and keeps it fresher than say a stagnant water filled bowl but it seemed to collect lots of crud and hair that never makes it through the tiny hole to the filter.  The reserve tank was useless...the water level never went down when the water was circulating so it was a pretty big waste of water.  Also, the thing makes terrible noise when not completely full (but the reserve tank never worked) so you have to dump water in it all the time or else listen to this loud grinding sound.  After, 7 or 8 months the pump conked out completely and so I went and bought a Drinkwell for my boy today.  The Drinkwell is superior in every way and kitty is happier with it.

Wow!  I thought these were eco-friendly only to find out through a little research that these aren't much better than the Pampers I was using.  Did you know they color their diapers brown to make you think that they're more eco-friendly?  I don't know about you, but how are they more environmentally friendly if they're using more dye to color them?  These really aren't any better than the diapers I was using.  No diaper is made of more than "trace" amounts of chlorine anyway..

Picked this up after my old Netgear router was making a high-pitched whine and I had had it with my Airport Express' constant dropped signals.  I then proceeded to wait to intall it because of all the warnings about the complicated set-up.  When I finally did get around to it, it went VERY smoothly.  There's a decent "wizard" in the included software that I think got everything working in a matter of minutes.  It would be nice if they included printed instructions, but the electronic manual on the CD is pretty good and helped me sort out a little confusion I had (that was of my own making - the wizard had actually set everything up properly).My system: Cable modem, one wired desktop computer, one wi-fi laptop, one Airport Express (for streaming music to my stereo), and a wi-fi iPod touch.The ONLY difficult part of the setup was the Airport, but that was the fault of that device, not the router (I couldn't reprogram it for the new network remotely, so I had to re-set it and reprogram it over ethernet).  Now I get ZERO dropout, not even the microwave interferes with the music stream.The router is silent and the lights are a cool and un-annoying blue.  I live in a Brooklyn apartment building and it serves up a great signal even out to the elevator.  On the flip-side, there's plenty of security options so my neighbors are hopefully not snooping on my network.I have not tried the USB port, but am looking forward to using it for serving up media to my yet-to-be-purchased netbook.  I will update this when I do.

Now that I have been able to toast and poach simultaneously, I can now go to my maker with a feeling of completion.  No longer needing to fear those "repetitive and harrowing transitions from awakening, dressing, and travelling to work" mornings.I wanted to mix peanut butter with an egg and see how that goes, but when I read a previous review about dripping sausage grease, I realized that I didn't yet have the Mr. Bento Stainless-steel Lunch Jar or the recommended vacuum and revolving pizza maker to make my experience complete.Fortunately for me, we bought this lovely item for about 50 cents at a thrift store to benefit people needing hospice care.Promise your loved ones that you will only get them this item as a gift if you know that they drive through McDonalds more than four times a week.  And if you do, well don't worry, because I will be sending my friends to thrift stores across the country trying to find more of these enticing items that was so ingeniously designed to maximize my cooking ability and save my last remaining vestiges of sanity that haven't been stomped on by some 30-something marketing major.

I've always liked the turbotax product until this year when the price increased due to so-called "free" e-file. Last year, I could not e-file because of some error in IRS records not matching my employer ID number. I had to paper file and received a $30.00 refund for the cost of e-filing. This year, if this error occurs, I won't get a refund because the cost of e-filing is already hidden in the cost of the product. I was tempted to use another product but my previous records are already in my turbotax electronic files. Additionally, there's no mention of free state e-filing. So what are you really getting here?

If you have only 1 or 2 Computers you are forced to buy the 3 Pack. It also is difficult to install. It can take hours each time you run the Update to install. It also forces you to uninstall any older versions of Norton or Symantec Products that you own and paid for. Next time I'll get McAfee at least they prorate any aditional install.

I have been using TurbTax for many years, and have always been happy with it. I liked, in particular, the ability of importing data from mutual fund sales and W-2s. It has always worked, but this year it stopped working for me. I called my mutual fund company, and they claimed that all was well.I called TurboTax support, and the assistant was nice and tried to be helpful. But in the end, nothing worked. So, I had to input the data manually. Not very satisfactory.Asides from this, TurboTax is a nice product. The interface seems to ahve improved this year for those that already know what forms they want to fill out. You may miss some helpful advice, but it sure saves time.

I ordered this product and it showed up OK but when I opened the box it was actually a 3 month supply. Amazon wanted me to return the pack of three to them and then they would send me a package of 6.  I suggested that they should send me a package of 3 to make up the difference and the customer service person indicated that this simply could not be done and that I would have to return the 3 pack *at my own expense* and then they would send me a 6 pack.  I asked if I could just get a partial refund. Again, this was unacceptable.  So I had to return to them the 6 pack at my own expense. And I did that.THEN... here's the kicker...When the 3 pack that should have been a 6 pack got back to them, they  informed me that I would have to take a full refund of the original purchase because they were OUT OF STOCK on Frontline in the weight class I needed. So I had to wait for it to be credited back to my card.  I'm still out of shipping BOTH WAYS and no frontline in hand.Moral of this story?Buy Local!

Let me start by saying I have two Eclipse I keyboards *office and home) and have put them through their paces.  They keys feel as solid and tight as they did the dirst day.  The lighting has held up well.I was super excited about the II coming out.  Better media keys, color choices, a dimmer knob...Only thing is if you want a keyboard you don't have to type on the Eclipse II is the one to get.  The keys are mushy and cheap feeling.  The glossy black platic is a finger print magnate (which given fingers are all over it...).  The media keys are cheaper feeling.  The dimmer knob on mine was loose and felt very cheap.  The backlighting itself... the red and purple were acceptable, but the blue was too dark and too dim to be of use.  Given my rig has blue lighting, this was a sticking point.  I would look at the first Eclispse or the Logitch well before goign witht he Eclipse II.  It is not worth it for looks or performace.

I purchase Ooma about 1 month ago. Setup was very easy and sound quality was near landline. But problem start when i needed to talk to customer support about deleting and adding a line since i could not do it in OOMA LOUNGE. I start contacting then by phone and e-mail since 3 weeks ago. To this day after several e-mails and phone calls nobody contacted me. That why i decided to return the unit to the retailer. If you are spending a lots of money on nationwide calls and you are not planing to do any kind of maintaineance that require customer service, then you might benefit from this product. But be carefull, since ooma actually is not a UNLIMITED CALLING SERVICE. If you have children that talk all day and total talk is more that 3000 minutes, OOma has the right to disconnect your service or charge you a lots of money without advance notice.(3000 minutes limit) and if you have DSL through your phone company then if you disconnect your service, you won't have broadband. Of course you can get broadband at the higher price without phone service. For us it didnot work since we use our cell phone to call nationwide. Also if Ooma goes out of business (and they are in financial trouble) then your service will be dicconected. (that is why their price is coming down too).Just do the math.

The original series sucked, still sucks, and always will suck. But for the good of mankind, please forget about it and pretend it never existed.  This show only resembles the original in concept.  In content, it is a totally new show - and it has everyone anyone could want in TV entertainment. Humor, action, drama, great characters, awesome performances, amazing plot twists and turns. See it, even if you normally don't care for sci-fi - you'll still like it, guaranteed.

These diapers WERE great. We had our new born last May, and have used LUVS since birth after trying Pampers and Huggies. On our little one, Huggies leaked all over the place every time, Pampers were OK but not better at a more expensive price. We've been ordering LUVS from Amazon from size 1. Somewhere in the middle of size 3 boxes (a couple of months back), the LUVS diapers that we've received suddenly changed in quality. The cross-hatch is gone (it's all white now), the diapers are thinner, and the elastic on the sides are awful now, they lose their elasticity very easily, and of course that means leaky diapers. We thought that might have been a one-time thing, but the next size 4 box that we ordered are the same 'new' no-good quality. Up above in the images, I see that someone else had the same experience. You can see from the pictures there that the diapers are different now. What happened to the great LUVS diapers???

This is by far one of the best laptops ever made by Apple, in terms of design, ergonomics, and performance. If you are a programmer or need to type a lot, you will soon realize that the keyboard on these machines are incomparably better than the new aluminum unibody MacBook Pros. The non-glare LCD screen is also much nicer to work when there are background lights. I simply cannot stand the glare on the new shiny screen. I hope Apple soon realizes that the shiny screens, although higher in contrast, are not preferred by most professional users.

I tried this prouct for about a month with my barking 1 year old boxer/lab mix.  The first day I turned it on it seemed like it was deterring him a little, but it didn't last any longer than that day, it seems like he just got used to it and blocked it out.  A friend of mine tried it on his husky mix with the same results so I have to say that I have no faith in this item I am going to give the citronella collar a try.

I've had the Capresso 560 for nearly three years and, though it has served me well enough, it has never failed to give plenty of bad with the good. Yes, it can produce espresso-level grind. Yes, it produces a good, consistent grind that makes great coffee. So? What's the problem: 1) When I first got it, the burrs were miscalibrated and it would not grind finely enough. I call to customer service eventually fixed this. 2) From the first couple weeks, the bean and grind bins developed hairline fractures. Though they've never completely broken, they are now almost opaque from this complex spiderwebbing. 3) The indicator line on the bean bin rubbed off after only a couple of months. I etched it back on myself, but it was never easy to read. Compare to the Baratza Maetro (my new grinder) on which the line is molded into the plastic. 4) About 2 years in, the grind indicator lines around the bean bin also began to wear off. As of its recent retirement, the body of the grinder is almost totally devoid of writing. None more black. 5) Hate the timer knob. Prefer a on/off switch. The timer was never long enough to grind enough beans for a full pot of coffee (12+ cups) and encouraged using the bean bin as an on off switch (in fact, the manual may have instructed using it this way). I feel certain that the constant turning of the bean bin led to the premature failure of the safety mechanism (see below). 6) Recently (and without warning) the safety (the mechanism that keeps the grinder from running with the bean bin removed. Started making only sporadic contact, meaning the grinder couldn't get up to speed or even work at all. Call to customer service claimed they'd never heard of such a thing and fixing/replacing would be $60. Perhaps that a reasonable amount of time for such a failure, but the cost of repair and lack of access to the mechanism means the grinder is essentially trash. I may try to crack it open a fix it to use as a backup grinder, but it made more sense to just replace it with the superior Baratza Maestro. Bottom line: If you have one, you're probably satisfied. If you don't, the Maestro looks like a better grinder for the same (nearly same) money. It has more grind settings, more durable clear plastic parts, produces less static, is quieter, and has an on/off switch. Maybe I'll be replacing it in three years too, but it seems a far more durable product.

I ordered the EeePC in Pearl White but I received it flat white I figured it is just the color so I would live with it. I used it for a short time and found it very slow and would lock up from time to time. I decided to return it due to poor product performance and wrong color from original order. I feel the company needs to work out the rest of the bugs before releasing it to the general public.

The first thing I have to say is 'If you've seen the movie you've read the book.'  That is how closely they are related.  But still, If you've enjoyed this movie-no questions asked-read the book!  It's perfect for all ages and a good read aloud book as well.  It has everything the movie has and more background on each of the characters too.  But anyways, this movie is really fun and I have proudly made it a part of my DVD collection.  This movie will catch the intrest of a variety of age groups-and if you are a teacher it is a good movie to share with your class weather it's 2nd grade or 8th (I remember my 8th grade science teacher giving us a break and showing it to us.)   So there you have it-Watch the movie-read the book and live happily ever after.

In our household, you couldn't go to the bathroom, brush your teeth, or just comb your hair in front of the mirror without one of our two Siamese mutts jumping up and asking for a "Sink Drink."  Usually, both Reese and Heather had to have a turn at the faucet.  Getting them their own fountain allows us to use our sink mostly on our own and gives all four of our feline family fresh water all the time.  Reese, who likes the water straight from the fountain, will drink at the most aerated top of the stream, while his sister Heather drinks near the bottom.  Getting your cats to drink fresh, clean water daily keeps them healthy.  The fountain reduces having to deal with bowls.  Cleanup is easy and the animals are well worth it.NOTE:  the filters are pretty common size pool filters, which you can get cheaper at the aquarium store!

I have owned many different bread machines, and still do.  The Zojirushi, the Panasonic and the Breadman Ultimate.This Zojirushi is becoming my favorite!It turns out great tasting, great looking loaves of bread every time.And the sourdough starter cycle does wonders.My only complaint is that the pan is not very nonstick.  You have to shake it pretty hard to get the bread out.  But big deal - as long as it comes out I'm happy!As far as Zo's customer service, I've never had any trouble.  I have called them to order spare parts for my rice cookers, and to order a spare pan for this bread machine in case I ever need it.  By spare parts I mean just that - spare.  I have not had any defects.  I just like having a spare pan etc on hand in case one gets scratched.  No trouble getting them on the phone, no trouble with my order.  I have absolutely no complaints.  Zojirushi makes great, innovative products and you should not hesitate to get this machine.

Philips Sonicare FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush with SanitizerI have owned Philips Sonciare toothbrushes before and always liked them.  This one is the best so far.  Not only is it a superb electric toothbrush, my mouth feels like it does after a dental cleaning. This is comfortable to use, has preprogrammed cycles for different types of cleaning.  The ultraviolet cleaning is a thoughtful addition and maybe especially useful for families. In short, great product and works as advertised.

I purchased this external drive to connect to the USB 2.0 port on the back of Apple's Airport Extreme router for purposes of using the router's Airdisk feature and use OS X 10.5.3 to treat that volume as a Time Machine vault (this feature was disabled before 10.5.3).  I chose this particular drive because it did not require an additional power source, which was a big plus for me since I am running out of outlets where my router is located.  It's also one less wire to have to deal with.  I also chose this item because it seemed small, and I was happy when I first saw it because it was smaller and lighter than I expected.Before I connected it to my Airport Extreme, I connected directly to my MacBook's USB port and formatted it as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) disk with Disk Utility.  This also removed the Windows applications that were preloaded onto the disk.  After setting up the disk with the Airport Extreme and Time Machine, I was up and running beautifully.My only complaint about this product is the packaging.  The drive comes in one of those difficult to open plastic packages that you'll spend 10 minutes trying to open.  If I had a strong razor blade or box cutter around, it would have been no problem.

It's a shame that this product has to get only one star (it would have gotten zero if that rating was available). The unit is the right size and weight, has a sexy look and feel and is just the right thing to put in your pocket and bring it along on your next trip.  If it only worked!I connected it, worked with it for an hour or so, loaded data in it and took it along for a long trip.  After using it for half an hour on my laptop the Passport stoped working; it would not connect to the computer. Thumb drives and other external devices worked all right but the Passport refused to idemtify itself to the computer, essentially preventing me from using the data I had stoted in it.  I tried the hardware wizard and all kinds of tweaking but could not get it going. I can feel some vibration, so the unit is working inside, but it won't connect.My data is locked in the useless Passport, I wasted a lot of time trying to make it workm and I lost my money because I won't return it with my sensitive data in it.  With this kind of unreliability the Pasport is a dangerous place to trust your data!

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

oh man.  this book has 563 pages.  about 400 of those pages i mostly liked.  the remaining pages were so bad that this only gets two stars. this will have spoilers.like i said in my review of 'twilight' i don't feel the edward/bella relationship.  it's completely ridiculous and unbelievable.  and in the beginning of the book when edward breaks up with her and leaves, i felt nothing, and i was probably supposed to feel as heartbroken as bella.  i felt no emotion because their relationship is a joke.  edward is so boring and dull and completely void of any personality.  and then at the end, when bella has to go "save" him, it's ONLY because he thinks that bella has died and he is going to go commit suicide.  omg.i had to literally force myself to read the end of this book because all i could think about was that they were only in the situation because edward was so weak and pathetic and selfish that he could not live without bella.  romeo and juliet is a classic work of literature that people should analyze and critique, not live by.  and i found it completely irritating that the author kept bringing it up.  jacob black was the only thing i liked about this book, and as it turned out, he didn't even need to be in it.  the majority of the book is about bella and jacob's friendship and how jacob is a werewolf.  but he had no part in the climax or conclusion of the book.  (except for the epilogue, which was good) what was the point of having him in there if his storyline wasn't going to tie into the main conflict?  major writing flaw there.  similar to twilight, new moon doesn't have any real plot until the last 100 pages.jacob is super interesting and has more character development in this book than edward and bella combined in the first two books.  also, the relationship between jacob and bella is way more believable than bella and edward.  when jacob is going through his werewolf changes, he essentially ends his friendship with bella because he believes himself to be a danger.  that scene was so emotional and i felt so much that i actually teared up.  same with the epilogue, it was very emotional.  i am going to finish the saga because there are characters that i do care about and want to see how their story ends.  however, between bella's over the top emoness over edward, and the horribly contrived "plot" this book was an overall let down.

I've been looking for a new blood pressure monitor. I had been using Mark of Fitness MF-81 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor for the last year, and while it gave me very steady results, they were always lower than my actual blood pressure reading.  After looking over the reviews, I selected this Omron monitor with the software.  It never worked for me.  The cuff is very comfortable, but I received more error readings than actual readings. When I received readings they were usually about 10 to 20 points lower than my actual pressure. The readings also varied greatly each time I took them.  I really wish this unit would have worked. I gave it two stars because I loved the cuff and the idea of the software. I never used the software since I was forced to return the whole thing when I couldn't get an accurate blood pressure reading.

You have heard it all with almost 2000 reviews but I'll put my 2 cent in also. I love the extra security clip. I always have trouble with them falling off my waistband. With this the extra tap keeps it from hitting the ground. I have killed countless ones that way.Also knowing how many aerobic steps out of your total is good. All in all it is an encouragement to see the number of miles and steps and calories burned.The only con is getting the battery in, I did so without too much trouble but then got interupted and when I got back to set the time I couldn't without taking the battery out and starting again. You have to do it right away. The battery compartment screws off with a tiny phillips screwdriver if you have trouble seeing small things that can be an issue.

I purchased this Cuisinart Brew Central coffeemaker a little less than one year ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it until now.  It made excellent, HOT coffee, was easy to use and clean.  However, it has now stopped pumping water into the filter rendering it useless.  Attempts to contact Cuisinart about replacement or repair (since it has a 3-year warranty) have been unsuccessful.  I've owned many coffeemakers over the years and none have broken as quickly as this one.

I make around a dozen pots of coffee each week.  That means that I have owned a lot of different coffee makers in the past.  In the last ... years I have used and discarded ...machines.  This machine is far better than any machine you could buy for [$$$], but it does cost almost [$$$].  I have been using it for ... months and love the hot fresh tasting coffee.  I have not yet replaced the water filter because the only place I have seen a replacement water filter is on the Cuisinart web site and they treat the water filter as a high end replacement part.  Nothing is perfect, but for a home machine this comes pretty close.

Here's my comprehensive review. Enjoy!SIZE: The Corsair 64gb flash drive is quite large... it's as long as my WD passport external hard drive and as fat as my thumb. It is difficult to plug in another USB device whilst this guy is attached as it takes up considerable room. It does come with an extension cable which does alleviate this problem, but it's yet another thing you have to carry around. The point of owning a flash drive is portability isn't it? When there are a lot of peripherals to carry around, it defeats this purpose. The cap is also a problem because it becomes loose with time and it's easy to lose.CASING: The drive is truly water resistant (as long as you still have your cap). It has a rubber shell that's pleasant to touch and it bounces when dropped. The more important aspect of this rubber texture is the fact that it grabs a hold of the inside of your pocket. Unlike some of the other reviews I've read, I actually like it .It's more difficult to accidently lose the drive when removing other objects from your pocket, like change.DESIGN: It's fairly ugly and it looks like an adult toy due to its size. Sorry, Corsair, but it does!FILE SYSTEM: It is formatted as FAT32. You cannot copy files larger than 4 gigabytes in size onto the drive because of this. I formatted mine to NTFS, which turned out to be a big mistake! DO NOT format it as NTFS!!! You will lose considerable read/write speeds if you do, even with a larger cluster size, say 16k. NTFS also burns out flash drives much quicker than FAT32 because NTFS writes to the drive even if files are only read. Also, once you change it to NTFS you'll have a hard time getting it back to FAT32 if you're on Windows: you'll need 3rd party software to do it, like Acronis Disk Director Suite.SPEED: TESTED ON WINDOWS VISTA ULTIMATE. I feel very disappointed with the speed of the drive. Read speeds were alright, but the write speeds are unacceptable. With the FAT32 file system write speeds average 1-1.3 MBps. Ehh. With NTFS write speeds deteriorated to 300 KBps! Now that is slllooooowwww. Keep it as FAT32 like I recommended before.CONCLUSION: The drive is too big physically to be a flash drive and too slow to be comparable to an external hard drive. If you want portable storage with this kind of capacity, get an external hard drive instead. The technology just isn't there right now to really be useful. I recommend a WD passport as a substitute.

I'm sorry, but this unit makes very weak coffee.  I really wanted to like this thing, because of the great variety of coffee choices available, but many of them are just barely drinkable.  I have to go along with a reviewer on another site who said that it's OK the Keurig doesn't make a full mug, because you wouldn't want to drink a full mug of this stuff anyway.This unit really, really needs some way to control the brew strength.On the plus side, there are a few "extra bold" varieties, but just a few, so if you stick to those, you miss the major advantage of the Keurig.My wife and I also noticed that all of the coffe made with the Keurig had a flavor element in common.  It's not quite a vending-machine flavor, but it's something that's not present in coffee made other ways.  As I write this, I'm sitting here drinking a cup of brown dishwater, a.k.a. French Vanilla, and planning on returning the unit.  Looks like it's back to Taster's Choice Hazelnut instant for me.  Not a great coffee, but the flavor beats any of the K-cups and I can make it as strong as I like.

I got this for my Husband for Christmas.  Due to circumstances, we had to open presents early (Wednesday, 23rd).  He was so excited!  We hooked it up to the computer to set it up.  All that appeared on the screen was vertical colored lines.  This went on for 10 minutes, then the screen went blank.  We could not start it back up, left it plugged in for a while thinking that the battery needed charging.  Come back later, NOTHING!  Contacted Apple, they say that it has to be shipped back for repair/parts/service/replacement.  Merry Christmas honey!  He got to look at it for 15 minutes!  Now I guess it will take approximately 8 to 12 weeks for them to send it back to us.  THANKS APPLE!

This is a great router for a college student.  The signal is just as fast as when I'm plugged into the wall. It's small and out of the way, and when in the right place, it can go through apt walls to all my rooms.  It was very easy to set up, and it has enough advanced settings to keep my signal very safe.  I named my signal something obscure, disabled the SSID broadcast so it doesn't appear on wardrivers' lists, and instead of an old WEP password, I use the WPA, which is supposedly faster, more secure, and old systems can't even use it.  I can even limit the MAC address of the users to just me or visitors.  With such a small footprint and great features, I love this router.

My husband purchased two of these for our 3 cats about a year or so ago. I was hopeful it would help break his aversion to kitty detail. It is a wonderful concept -- roll and dump. I found the boxes easy to put together and operate. However, all of this is well and good provided your cats will tolerate a covered litter box. I've had to learn the hard way, after cleaning innumerable puddles of urine from the floor, that my oldest not only dislikes one box covered, but demands ALL boxes be uncovered.Some other considerations for this product:- Periodic cleaning is more complicated than a standard box since you have to dissemble to wash out all the nooks on the sifter. - Previous reviewers discussed litter amounts ... there is no need to fill more than a standard 2-3 inches. Any higher volume and the sifter gets a bit overwhelmed.- I've experienced a small leakage of litter when rotating, I'm guessing a small warp in the plastic is to blame. This problem is worse if you overfill the pan, perhaps because of the excess weight.- Most importantly to those complaining about clean litter in the cup ... follow the arrows on the top -- there is a right way and a wrong way to rotate.- The large boxes are HUGE, so note the measurement before buying.Unfortunately, through no fault of the product, I am back to manual scooping. This isn't the end of the world, except I am the only household resident with a strong enough stomach to perform the task (well except the dogs, but I can't abide by their methods of disposal).

There has been at least one review that highlighted some of the sexual scenes in the film. To respond to that reviewer, the film was rated PG-13, not G or even PG. Furthermore, don't get me started on why foul language/moderately graphic violence or other behaviors are allowed and tolerated in most big budget Hollywood films that ARE aimed at children! After all, this is a review of Iron Man. Most people who didn't 'get' Robert Downey's portrayal of Stark didn't ever read the original comics, or if they did, forgot much of what they read. Let's not forget that Tony Stark was the original rich, womanizing, misogynistic playboy who had an epiphany steering him onto a new course in life. I didn't all of a sudden go from a hard drinking, cigar smoking playboy to a Priest, but he DID change his ways. This was portrayed by Downey almost flawlessly.  To categorize this as a flawless performance would be difficult because movies about superhero characters lend themselves to so much broad interpretation from long time comic fans, to casual readers, to those who dismiss comics as 'kid stuff'.At it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero. I'm glad that the movie wasn't action top to bottom. This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!) I for one look forward to IM 2, but I'm less anticipatory of the Avengers...I mean look at the X-Men franchise!

We bought this item because our daughter wouldn't sleep for very long unswaddled when her arms could flail around and she would wake herself up.  We did not find this item useful at all because she would get herself out of it in a matter of minutes and be up again.  We now use a recieving blanket with a little stretch and our 5 week old daughter sleeps for 4-6 hours at night.

This has turned a relatively stable suite of products into a less-intuitive and less-productive hassle. Word and Excel crash regularly, documents that are related to Office download from Safari as .xla, .pot and .dot. For me, though, the biggest issue is the revisions to the Excel chart maker and it's lack of an x-axis naming field. All in all, Office 2008 adds about 25% more time to projects than it's predecessor.On the plus side? Macros are gone.

We just bought one of these things.  Actually got one with two bowls.  Both bowls went into the deep freeze.  After 7 hours we tried using the first bowl.  It was frozen solid.  We made the simple vanilla recipe in the book.  All we got was vanilla flavored cold soup after 30 minutes.  We put the liquid into the freezer in an ice cream container.  Ended up with a rather large vanilla ice cube.  The second bowl stayed in over 24 hours and we tried the vanilla recipe again.  Same results after 30 minutes.What a waste of money.  It's going back and I'm getting down my old Rival ice and salt style ice cream maker.

If you are considering getting this trimmer, all you need to know is this: The 9 lockable length settings don't actually lock!! I tried putting it on length "3", but when I started to trim, it went down to length "2".  Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1.  Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it's called), so it's very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower.  I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t.  In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy "vacuum effect" has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  I would have given this 0 stars if it would have been an option.

I have found that this quart yogurt maker produces more consistent yogurt than the model which contains individual glass cups.  I cover mine with a tea towel to reduce drafting or changes in the exterior temperature and it has always rewarded me with delicious yogurt.  My usual recipe includes low fat or skim milk but I add dry nonfat milk for extra creaminess and I like the yogurt more tart, so I tend to incubate it for the longer time.  Rather than start with a powdered starter, I buy the greek style full fat yogurt from Trader Joe's (similar to Greek Fage yogurt) and reuse a bit of the homemade yogurt for the next batch.  I do begin with a new purchased yogurt every 6 to 8 weeks just to freshen things up.  This also produces yogurt which makes excellent yogurt cheese which is similar to a cream cheese consistency by straining it over cheesecloth in a fine mesh strainer in the refrigerator for a couple days.  Be sure to place this over a bowl and check the bowl regularly since the liquid will fall quickly from the yogurt.  I often use the whey in recipes, too.

Then, certain web sites would no longer load on my desktop that is connected to the router via ethernet cable (particularly web sites that require a log in).  After another 48 hours or so, I could not access the web at all.  I had to reboot the router and reload the software, and the whole process repeated itself.

I was excited to get this iced tea maker--we really drink a lot of iced tea.  I received it as a gift about a week ago, and today, I got it out to use it for the first time.  I filled it with water and ice, placed my tea bags in the basket, put it all together and plugged it in.  I pressed the "on" button, it lit up, and then I sat down with a magazine.  I could hear it starting to brew, but after about a minute, it just stopped.  I checked, and the light was off.  I tried to turn it back on, but nothing happened when I pressed the button.  I tried moving to a different outlet, plugging it in, and turning it on, and again, nothing.  It won't brew tea and the light doesn't even turn on.  I'm very upset about the poor quality of this item, especially since I wanted this particular tea maker instead of the Mr. Coffee one in part because of the reviews I read here.  I've called Hamilton Beach but have been unable to find someone who can help.  Guess I'm just stuck with it.

I tried OneCare's trial version on a new computer we put into our small business network.  I had intermittent problems loading and printing across the network through some of our older DOS programs (yes, we still use several old programs because they work great). The puzzling thing was that I could reboot the computer one time, or nine times before the DOS programs would load and print--it was that unpredictable. I disabled OneCare to see if it was causing the problem.  The problems persisted, so I assumed it was caused by something else and bought OneCare through Amazon for all our computers.  The same problems then occurred with those computers, so I uninstalled OneCare, which solved all our loading and printing problems.  I also found that OneCare slows Netscape to a crawl (yeah, I know--it's a dinosaur, but so am I).  Microsoft may treat you OK if you use all the latest apps, but apparently they don't even test this product on older software.  I switched to Avast, and life is good.

I took my dog to the vet today and they even confirmed that my dear dog is covered in fleas.  I will never ever use their product again with such an uncaring company policy.

I question all these excellent reviews I see for this product. I wonder if they are plants from the company or seller. This product is annoying at the very least. The speaker is small and the sound is not very good. In addition, every sound has a distinct background sound that loops every 4-5 seconds. After awhile, it becomes hard to focus on the  intended sound whether its the rain, waterfall, etc.. Save your money and get a cheap cd player with speakers and environmental sound CD. You will sleep or relax better.

It has a rather heavy theme, and the way humor was encorporated really lightened it up and made the time fly.

I received a defective product and there was none in stock to replace it. When I asked for a full refund, the manager told me he would have to charge a shipping fee & a restocking fee of 15%.Given the nature of the situation I refused to accept nothing but a full refund. He spoke over me refusing to listen to my reasoning then began screaming at me. He demanded I post positive feedback first, and then he would refund my money. Feeling blackmailed I refused. He then told me I would get no refund at all. I have nothing in return for my 44.62. I can not help but wonder if the positive comments posted here have been coerced.

I use this mat daily for my "Baby Bootcamp" class I take, and I use it mostly in the grass. It is VERY easy to clean (with a damp sponge) and is more water resistant than a Tuffo mat. I didn't give it a 5-star because it doesn't always fold up easy (when you fold it up you really have to squish all the air out) so most of the time I don't velcro it up closed. I get a lot of compliments on the colors.

If you're cat is an indoor cat, yes this product will work well for you. But if your cats go outside like mine, FORGET IT! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately. But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days, like they advertise. I've tried Advantage on my cats a few times. The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours. But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before. I'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half. If the product wasn't so expensive, it might be worth the money. But don't waste your money, because it only works well for a few days. Frontline works a lot better.

I first received a Sonicare toothbrush several years ago. It was a gift from a dental hygienist friend, and it was the Sonicare Elite e7300. I used the brush every day for about five years until it finally died, due to the button which turns it on finally wearing out completely.I have nothing but praise for the Elite e7300, but I now use the Essence 5300. I have been using the Essence 5300 for about two months and I have not noticed any differences in quality or effectiveness between the two brushes. The Elite e7300 had additional features such as a LED battery indicator and a 30 second interval on beeps (which helps you to distribute time spent brushing among the four sections of your teeth), but while those features are useful they aren't something that I even really care about or miss having.Anyhow, the Sonicare toothbrushes clean incredibly well. I cannot go back to regular toothbrushes now. The difference is like night and day. The Sonicare brushes clean extremely thoroughly, if used properly, and my teeth feel as though they have been polished after brushing. I had a little bit of plaque buildup before using the Sonicare, but after about two weeks of using the brush regularly the plaque buildup eroded, and after about a month my teeth were noticeably whiter.Since using the Sonicare brushes I have not had a single cavity or any periodontal problems. The first time I went to the dentist after getting my Sonicare it almost felt like I wasted money on my appointment, because the hygienist barely had anything to clean. I used to go to the dentist every six months, but I feel the brushes are so effective at cleaning that I now go to the dentist every year and a half to two years. The brush has paid for itself by keeping me free from periodontal problems and allowing me to stretch out the time between teeth cleanings.No, I am not a shill. The brush really is that good.

I will freely admit to loving the first three books, but as for Breaking Dawn, all I can say is WTF????? I eagerly waited at Barnes and Noble to get my copy at MN and rushed home to read it. After the perfect wedding and start of a great honeymoon, my bliss dissolved into numb disappointment and anger. How is Bella pregnant? What kind of name is Reneesmee Carlie? What next Rosalice or her brother Jasemmett??         I just felt the whole time that I read this book that it was a different author writing this [..]. The characters felt different, like it was a new Bella and Edward. Stephenie Meyer wouldn't destroy her characters like this. She wouldn't have Jacob IMPRINT on a BABY!!!!      The book was saturated with plot that made little sense. Would Alice really leave without saying why? Could we cram another vampire with a screwed up name in the story? So many new characters with no reason to care about them. The climax with the Volturi was anticlimactic which was a letdown. We have been so worried about how the Volturi were going to interfere with Bella and Edward and we got that? No one died, not that I wanted to lose anyone, but that's not realistic. Characters die, as we all know.    As far as I'm concerned, Eclipse was the end. I will imagine their REAL happily ever after. Well, SM you had a good career until now. I hope it was worth it to destroy your characters.           Is the Twilight movie gonna suck too?

I do not consider myself to be a real techie but have spent the last 5 years working in IT and usually have no problem. Unfortunately for me, I ran into problems setting up the router with my T1 line and routing it wirelessly to a Centrino IBM laptop. My experience with Linksys tech support was one of the worst experiences I have had. The reps were dificult to understand and their knowledge of the technology was severely lacking. In addition, on multiple occasions, the reps would hang up when the troubleshooting reached a dead end. Only advice: Hope your installation is flawless. Because if you run into any remotely complex problems, you may end up spending days trying to resolve it.

Why did I not think of that! Life is like a light switch! And the" joke" is on everyone who doesn't believe that you're so smart or all-knowing! I didn't enjoy seeing people who are somewhat troubled being exploited, so you can have a good laugh at their expense. Did it ever cross your mind that there's a really big difference between sincerely held beliefs, no matter how outlandish -  that are not hurting anyone - and those who use religion for profit and/or to control others? Bill, you also came across stupid yourself. The Ex-Gay clergyman who believes being Gay is a sin - "looks Gay" because he's "neat and good-looking!"  Give me a break! What you unwittingly succeeded in doing was make this bigot look sympathetic, instead of scary,  because you came across as such a jerk! I'm all for your attacks on the greedy pigs, crazy bigots  and mind-boggling hypocrites you so cleverly expose!

I love gadgets, (intelligent ones) that is. The Ipod Touch is an intelligent gadget, and this Amazon seller had a very competitive price.  Although, I'm satisfied to use just itunes and mail (came in handy last few weeks when I was in the Caribbean on vacation) features for now, there are other great apps that I'll explore later. I'm over 50, and with so much to think about I like gadgets uncomplicated, so I appreciate the graphic interface which means you can figure things out logically. It took only a  short while for me to learn to lighten my touch to use it and my son taught me how to "pinch and zoom" to read articles on the internet and to view photos - so neat! I look forward to learning other tricks. With all the other features I'm NOT using yet, I'm under utilizing mine right now, but I still enjoy it. I bought the DLO case to protect it from fingerprints and scratches, and I invested in a good pair of headphones, for long waits or flights. If you love gadgets like I do, you'll enjoy this one.

Zen 8GB Player. This player has already taken a lot of my patience, the same day I received it through Amazon.com, the player locked up as I was turning it on.  It locks up at times when you really want to listen to your music.  I've had this player for 8 months now.I would not recommend this to anyone unless you don't mind going through the reset button, software resets, and lock ups.  The only thing that I liked about this player is that it has an FM receiver that IPods don't offer, so I am sucking it up until then.

I have had two of these players in the space of a week.  Both broke down almost immediately. The major flaw in this machine is the USB charging.  You have to register it first, and it has to have power to register.  If your battery runs out, you cant register, so you've got yourself a very stylish brick.In short, Creative Labs made a very stylish player that has one fundamental flaws.  Get an iRiver, a Zune or an iPod.

Like many on this forum, I am disappointed with the 500gig My Book because it died after 14 months, and the warranty lasts only 12. Turned on the computer one day, heard a hard clicking sound and - poof! it was dead. And to make things even more disconcerting, this is the second WD drive I have had fail on me within a few months. One of the two WD 500 gb drives in the RAID array inside my main PC died as well about a month prior. (Thank God I was smart enough to have purchased a RAID array on my main PC or I would have lost everything.) I have a strong feeling that the WD 500 gig models were not built well. (Don't know about the 1TB models.)Also, as others have noted, besides the 12 month warranty there is no separate on/off switch which makes it harder to turn off the drive. (The blue botton in the middle did not work reliably for me.) My new drive is an Iomega 1TB model that has this feature. Hopefully, by powering off when I am not backing up, it will extend the life of the drive. Because the My Book was intended for use strictly as a backup device, there was no data permanently lost. But I strongly recommend not buying a My Book or any other single drive solution to hold precious photos, quicken files etc. Only use it as a back up device. If you need to add additional storage that will hold precious data, do yourself a big favor and buy a home office NAS device like the one from NetGear or Cisco - and make sure you have 2 drives in the device. (Many come with 1 and you have to buy the second one.) Yes, it will set you back $400 or more dollars but that is nothing compared to the tragedy of losing irreplaceable photos, videos, music etc. As an IT professional, I can tell you that hard drives are the most fragile part of the PC and can die at any time without warning. That is why all important servers in a business environment use RAID (multiple hard disks) to ensure redundancy. Do the same for your home PC.

I've got a confession to make, and I'll say it right here so there's no doubt about it: Before "Watchmen," I had never read a graphic novel.  I remember, as a boy, my mother purchasing me a comic book (or two, if I was exceptionally good, which I really tried to be) from the local grocery store.  I think I collected a grand total of ten.  They never really moved me.  They never interested me, until later, after I gained a bit more literary experience.  Now in my early 20's, I noticed a lot of my friends enjoy comics and graphic novels; I decided that I should give them a try as well.  All this being said: I shall not judge "Watchmen" as a graphic novel, for I am not qualified to do so.  But being an avid reader of novels, short stories, essays, nonfiction, poetry, and song lyrics, I shall judge "Watchmen" as a work of literature.  And the verdict?  A masterpiece.1985 in some alternate universe, where Nixon is still president (dear God), we won the Vietnam War (not as great as you might think), and superheroes were once part of American culture.  Spurred by comic books, ordinary men and women took up costumes and monickers, patrolling the streets of their cities.  Some of them even united together.  But, in 1985, the only operative superheroes are those sponsored by the government: like Doc Manhattan, once a man, now possessed of indescribable capabilites; and the Comedian, a rough and tumble anti-hero (I hesitate to include "hero" at all) who has just been murdered.Rorschach, a masked vigilante who was once a hero and is now wanted for murder, investigates.  He sees a disturbing pattner.  A "mask killer"--someone out to kill superheroes.  Teaming up (if somewhat reluctantly, on their behalf) with retired heroes the Nite Owl (II) and the Silk Spectre (II), he sets out to investigate what happened, uncovering a conspiracy to rival all conspiracies, one that may just lead to World War III...Ah, okay.  Obligatory plot summary out of the way.  It doesn't begin to cover it; "Watchmen" is so layered with subtext and imagery, a mere summary of the novel's surface plot is almost an indulgent excess.  Let me just say this: Alan Moore is a paranoid but fantastic writer, and Dave Gibbons is a gifted (and slightly disturbed, all for the better) illustrator.  I could not put "Watchmen" down; I had the fortune to read it while I was sick (and thus equipped with a dandy of an excuse to skip class).  I'm not sure it made me feel any healthier...in fact, much to the contrary...but it inspired me to delve deeper into this literary medium.  I'm not sure if anything I read from now on will stand up to "Watchmen;" I can only say that I thoroughly enjoyed my forray into this twisted and cruel (and utterly realistic) world, and that I am a wiser and more cautious person for it.

I bought the Cannon FS100 (blue) even after reading all the reviews about the problems with the .MOD file extension. After receiving the camera and playing with it for a few hours it was really symple to save the movies. I took two videos, changed the file extension to .MPG. Opened Windows Movie Maker. I imported the two movies and clicked save to my computer. Then enter the file name, choose a place to save, click next and go to other settings. Choose (High Quality Video-large) Once the movie is joined the quality is excellent. I have no problem with saving, using this method. I'm really happy with this camera. I hope this helps.

If your looking for a basically plug and play router this is it. Plug it in and plug your computer into one of the hard wired port and use the 198.167.1. configuration. It is easy to MAC filter to specify which computers you allow on your network. There are also Parental Controls which can limit the times and allowed sites, ie. No Adult sites.

I was very impressed after reading the raves on amazon and decided to give it a try. So excited to open the box after couple days of waiting, I baked my first loaf the same day I received it.The bread was burned in the buttom but very good texture inside. Of course, the cycle was very long and preheating time alone was about 30-40minutes.  I thought , maybe I need work on the precision of measurement. Then I noticed the cermaic piece holding heating coil was broken into two pieces, the heating element had nowhere to sit but resting on the botton of the unit. Then I took a look at my old Oster bread machine and found out the heating element was fixed securely to the side of the oster machine with cermaic insulator, nothing shaky and unstable like the heating coil in the panasonic unit.  I have a small kid running around and curious about everything, if the heating coil sitting on the button and heat the whole unit, it becomes a fire hazard. I had no chice but return it.          Disappointment is a understatement after reading so many great reviews on amazon and epinion. But the design of the cermaic piece is very unreliable and could turn this machine into a disaster.         I did some research on the web and found out the ceramic piece has been a common complaint. if you turn the pages of review on amazon, you will see several reviews mentioning the same problem. But the most recent reviews did not note anything like it. Just want to let people know, the problem is still there, and please take into consideration.

I had just about given up hope for a deshedding tool until I purchased this product. I had previously bought, owned and discarded several tools that purported to end shedding to no avail. This product definitely cuts down on the shedding by at least 50% and my dog (a husky) falls asleep during the grooming. The only issue is that this product would need blade replacement, and the blades are expensive... Also there aren't any instructions on when or how to replace one when the time comes. Otherwise, I am thoroughly satisifed!

How many ways must a person try this machine to actually get it to work?  We're never trying another cuisinart ice cream maker.No matter how cold I got the liquid and how much I made sure the frozen bowl was at zero degrees (the way other users have advised), I got a ring of immoveable solid frozen liquid all the way around the edge of the bowl, and cold liquid in the middle - and the machine wouldn't do any more than that. I tried several recipes, same problems, nothing anywhere near ice cream.  Gee how about some cold pudding with a chunk of hard-as-rock ice on the side?Could some of the reviews for this product be a bit overly optomistic?

Zymox Otic With 1.0% Hydrocortisone 1.25 Oz BottleWe have five poodles, Standard, Miniature, and Toy, all with the same problem, chronic ear infections.  Desperate and going broke over all the vet trips, we discovered Zymox Otic a year ago.  We bought the 8 oz bottle  because we have so many dogs.  This stuff is magic!!  It has completely cured all of our dogs.  We now only have to use it once a week, just to clean out the ears and keep them infection free, and when they come from the groomers, which was always the start of a new infection before Zymox.  Our vet wanted to know how we cured them and we told him about Zymox, he never heard of it. Now we tell everyone who has dogs, if the are prone to ear infections, get Zymox and save both your dogs and your money!!P.S.  It worked so well on the dogs that when my husband was up one night with an ear infection himself, he figured, why not? It fixed him right up!! (I'm not saying people should use dog medicine, just saying my husband did and it worked).

If you need the calendar function, give that up right now because if you have a large calendar, the iPod Classic will NOT work for you. (note: the 5th generation video handles large calendars beautifully.)Everything you try to do on the Classic happens extremely slowly, and it only shows a subset of your contacts if you have many. (the 5th generation video is much faster and can show all of your contacts.)The screen scratches the second you take it out of the box. That's right: Build quality is down too. (i've been carrying around my 5g video with no case for over a year and it's barely scuffed.)Also, the new version of Solitaire is slow and ugly as hell. How did they find a way to make a slow version of SOLITAIRE? In 2008?? (every previous ipod with solitaire plays it very quickly.)This iPod was a huge step DOWN from the 5th generation video. I'm going to get a hard drive upgrade in my 5th generation (30->80) and stay with a true classic until Apple makes an ~80 gigabyte Touch, since clearly they don't give a ---- about their scroll wheel players anymore.

Moonlight is a collection of everything bad about the vampire film genre. With poorly written uncharismatic characters, like Mick: the man unwillingly turned by his vampire wife, and the suddle-as-a-sunrise romance between the male and female leads. The episode plots are laughable, ranging from a recently turned doctor vampire to a rampaging teen vampire with hormonal issues. There are also half baked love triangles and poor attempts at "shadow conspirecies" that make you wonder if the writers where being timed on how fast they could churn out a story as opposed to actually writting something worth watching. Sadly the producers tried to bank on a show who's main draw was a goodlooking male lead. This is almost the same gameplan as trying to sell young males on Halle Berry as Catwoman, and look how that turned out. Note to the potential buyer: There are only 16 episodes for a reason!

This router is horrible. First of all there is no bridge mode, so if you connect it to another router you will have two subnets going, and any ports you want to open will have to be opened twice, once on each router. So onto the speed of the router. I thought that maybe I was getting low speeds because I was running through two routers, so I got rid of the router that was before the Dir-825, and put a little Ethernet hub there instead. The hub does no routing so it doesn't effect speed. After this my speed still sucked, oh and i'm talking about WIRED. Yea wired I was getting downspeeds around 3 Mbps. Moving onto wireless. The 2.4ghz band is a joke, I was getting throughput under 1Mbps. Under the 5ghz band I reached speeds around 3Mbps, but I could rarely even detect the 5ghz network. Even when I was in the same room as the router, the 5ghz network would not always appear under my choice of available networks, and yes it was set to broadcast. My setup prior to this was my Asus router would go into the ethernet hub, and then the ethernet hub would go into an Apple Airport Express. On the 5ghz network on the express I would do 10Mbps downstream. The only reason I got rid of that setup was because when I would do heavy downloading on my wired that was connected to the hub, the airport express would get very little bandwidth from the hub, and I figured an actual wireless router in place of the switch would be able to route the bandwidth more efficiently. Boy was this router a bad choice. Now when I do heavy downloading, I can barely browse the the web over wired. I'm sending this back, and getting a Apple Airport Extreme.Oh I almost forgot, the install CD is horrible. In order to set up the router after reset, I had to reconnect the computer without the router, really annoying if your connections run throughout the house. Also the CD takes at least 15 minutes to set up the router which in my opinion is way too long.

This little wonder functioned beautifully, not to mentioned all the comments I got on its tiny size.  Too bad I managed to loose it while carrying it in my wallet.  In the course of carrying it for two months the casing became ever so slightly bent as a result of the pressure experienced in the wallet.  However, I did not experience delamination issues that others have mentioned.  If you can keep track of this little puppy I highly recommend it!

Bought this router for my home - it works fine with my roommate's Windows PC but just refused to with my Macbook. It didn't come with any detailed instructions, only a one-click installation CD which runs only on Windows. Tried pretty much everything I could find on the internet but failed. "Linksys customer service does not support MAC" - thats the one line response I got when I called them for assistance. Would have returned it but a friend put in a round-about fix to make it work .. but even with that I need to change a list of settings each time I switch between home and school. It is painful but it works!

Good Stuff:-It was easy to set up, although, I'm very comfortable with computers.-I get very cheap international rates.-Very good sound quality (I have 5Mbits upload though)Not So Good Stuff:-When I first called them about moving my Verizon phone number to Ooma, the guy wasn't friendly, and he didn't have an answer to one of my billing questions.-Moving my phone number from Verizon was supposed to take about 3 weeks. Almost a month went by and then I get an email about it. They haven't even started yet. This email was their first attempt at moving my number over. In the email they referred to an attachment that they forgot to attach. However, once I sent them some information they needed in that attachement, it took exactly 3 weeks to get service. Conclusion:No monthly bills, great voice quality, cheaper international. My mother prefers the caller ID and voicemail of Ooma to the ones of Verizon. I docked it one star because the customer service experience detailed here. However, my family loves it and I fully recommend this.

I can't believe I'm raving about a litter box, but I am. I've raved about this to my husband, to my friends, on my blog... to everyone who'll listen, as a matter of fact. I have a kitten whose rather finicky about litter box hygiene, and a large house -- which means I need more than one litter box. I thought to replace one of our litter boxes with this, leaving the ol' 'covered box' as his main one.Well, my kitten apparently has other plans. He's stopped using the others, so now I'm ordering two more just like this.This litter box is SO easy to clean:1. Keep 3" of clumping litter in it at all times. Refill as needed.2. Shake the box vigorously after cleaning to "level" the litter.3. To clean, roll the box upside-down on the round side. 4. Return the box to rightside up. 5. Remove the drawer and dump the drawer's contents.That's IT. The top is secured with very firm clasps to ensure the litter doesn't go flying everywhere when you roll it, and the hole in front is not only large enough for big kitties, but also for you to add litter using a jar if you don't want to have to remove the box's lid.Seriously, it's worth the money. You'll never mind cleaning the litter box again. That, my friends, is PRICELESS!

I hate it when one little detail can ruin an entire book for me.**SPOILERS AHEAD**I still love Twilight and New Moon.  And the first half of Eclipse is good.And I also must say I have nothing against Jacob.  He annoys me with some stupid, selfish, twisted things he does, but he's still an interesting character.  And in the end, he got what he knew was coming, so I'm good with that.I'm sorry, but Bella's sudden realization of, "Oh yeah, I love Jacob, too," just doesn't fly with me.If I read right, it's an interesting concept--I think Meyer was hinting that Bella and Jacob were imprinted, but Edward's existence messed that up, and Bella's tug for him is stronger (maybe they were meant to be imprinted in a past life, but his being a vampire ruined it somehow, I don't know).  And in the end, Bella went with the guy she already knew she couldn't live without, despite Jacob saying Edward was her drug, but he would be her sun and air.But Meyer really messed it up.  In the first two books, and most of the third, Jacob is a clear-cut, defined family member to her.  No hinting at other feelings whatsoever.  Then when Jacob kisses her and interprets her trying to hurt him wrongly, and deepens the kiss, and Bella suddenly gives in and thinks, "Oh!  I do love him."Just... no.Look.  The idea of imprinting (also known as soul mates) is that you're connected to that person whether you like it or not.  And outside circumstances do mess that up.  In L.J. Smith's Daughters of Darkness, for example, Mary-Lynnette and Ash are soul mates.  Throughout the story Ash realizes he loves her, but Mary-Lynnette fights it until the end.  The key different here, though, is that Mary-Lynnette learns more about Ash and comes to appreciate some of his qualities.  That, and there is nothing stronger pulling her away from him.Also, in the end, Mary-Lynnette is still a little frightened of Ash and what he's done in the past, and she basically tells him to go away so he can try to redeem himself and she can finish at least high school.  Ash tells her he'll come back in a year, and she says, "That may be too soon," and Ash simply says, "I know.  I'll come back anyway."Basically, L.J. Smith acknowledged that as they were, it couldn't work out--both Ash and Mary-Lynnette had to work out their own lives, first.Stephenie Meyer, in Eclipse, had me all set and thinking Jacob was like Bella's brother, and then out of nowhere it's, "I love him, too."  Yes, she slightly redeems it with, "I love Edward more," but it was still unexplained, out of nowhere, and created angst where there shouldn't have been.  It was much more interesting when Jacob was stubborn and Bella already knew where her life was going.  Screwing it up like that just felt like she wanted to get some of her own fantasies into the book, belatedly, or that she wanted to appease some fans somewhere, or leave it open.And it wouldn't have been a bad idea... if her backstory for them in Twilight and New Moon hadn't been so solid.I will say, however, that Edward's growth of character was a pleasure.  I did enjoy that.The only problem is, I'm wary of picking up Meyer's new adult book when it comes out next year.  I was all set to, but that major flaw just... I dunno.  It left a sour taste in my mouth, especially since I'd been admiring her foreshadowing and plot twists and originality so much.

I finally received my LaCie hard drive. This is a well made piece of equipment - it has a solid, heavy construction and an elegant appearance.I was relieved that the light is a pleasant shade of blue and is not bright at all, unlike other hard drive lights with blindingly bright LEDs.This drive is not silent, though it is fairly quiet. I can clearly hear the drive running from several feet away but it's not disturbing. The fellow who said that he can't hear it with his ear right next to it, well the drive must not have been running at that moment.I'm using this as a Time Machine backup drive. With a Firewire 400 connection to my old G5 iMac, it backed up 270 GBs in under 5 hours. At first the Time Machine backup was dog slow. Then I remembered to turn off my virus software, AND most important, I changed the Spotlight preferences by selecting the Privacy tab and adding my backup drive to prevent Spotlight from indexing/searching it. After that the backup process just flew!After writing data for 5 hours the drive was warm, but not hot. The aluminum heat-sink case seems to cool the drive very well.Eventually I will attach it to an Apple Airport Extreme via USB to use it as a network drive for wireless use by my laptop as well. Unfortunately the Airport Extreme wireless router does not provide a Firewire 400/800 connection - just ethernet or the much slower USB 2.0. I'll provide an update on the performance at that time.All in all, I am quite happy with this purchase.

To complete the e-File process requires you to print out a paper form 8453-S, sign it and submit it back to the TurboTax program in PDF format for inclusion in the electronic return.TurboTax suggests three ways to produce this PDF file:1. Fax it or submit it via Internet to a third party service for conversion - which means you would be giving out sensitive private financial information - I can't believe they would even suggest this.2. Create the PDF file yourself by scanning it and converting it using a commercial product such as Adobe Acrobat (expensive) or by using TurboTax PDF Printer Driver. There is a link to the Intuit site to download this driver but the link is broken. The driver does not appear to be anywhere on the Intuit site. E-mail to Intuit support was answered by someone who, judging from the answer, was not even aware of the existence of TurboTax Business.3. Go to an office supply store to have the file converted (for a fee of course).I wasted half a day on this. Mailing the paper return seems now attractive in comparison.

Professional users beware - there is not much to like with this version of the Office Suite.  I had to purchase the full version as my disk crashed and I could not find my prior software disks (Office 2003).  I have been laboring along for 2 months trying to work out problems with Office 2007, but I think I will buy Office 2003 on ebay and try to take Office 2007 off.  My main gripes - Outlook doesn't work - it insists I am on a LAN and won't load my personal folder from before (that is the main reason for buying over home edition).  Tech support was a gal in China, I gave up with her efforts to solve. Other gripes - All functions create files in a new format that is not compatable with earlier versions of PowerPoint, etc.  You have to remember to save in the earlier format if you share files with other folks lucky enough to have earlier versions.  Office 2007 has somehow disabled my DVD/CD writer so I can't use that.  The new toolbar 'ribbons' are frustrating for someone who has used earlier Office versions for years.  They are not intuitive and you spend too long trying to find what you need.  I still cannot copy live links into another document as plain text, cannot format documents as I want, and hate the defaults.  The spell checker defaults to French, the Word documents to some crazy font I've never heard of, and double spacing.  Powerpoint is slightly more powerful if you figure out how to use it.  Excel is about the same - the least change it seems.  Microsoft and their outsourced help group get an "F" from me.  I was asked to list all the problems I found.  I said I get $200 an hour for technical support and I haven't heard back!   Microsoft - stop trying to be an Apple and keep your products consistent.

I had the CH yoke before this one and I just want to say that this one is better in a lot of ways.  It feels better and it seems to be well made just look at the big metal bar.  I am still trying to figure out the different modes but there are plenty of buttons and having flown the real thing this one feels a little closer.  The added throttles are also fantastic!  The only downside that it will require getting a new desk of some velcro or two sided tape to mount it, that can be a challenge! So far, thankfully, I have not encountered any "phantom" buttons.

This product worked great for the first three weeks... then it wouldn't save anything.  For example, I saved a few files on one computer, properly removed it, and immediately tried to open the files on another computer... but they weren't there.  On the good side, the seller refunds 70% of the price.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

Once again, Stephenie Meyer has captured and enhanced my imagination in this novel, somehow managing to make me think everything in this book truly happened. Now, I'm no sap, so don't judge me, but I guarantee you will /cry/ in this book. At least one time.Either that or become extremely depressed.Keep a phone handy for the end of Chapter 3, so you can blubber out your misery to a friend, that's all I'll say.But beyond that, let me mention that I read this 563-page-long book in a grand total of six hours. Every page is as awesome as the last, if not better, and though Bella may seem like a wuss most of the book, don't be turned off. The ending is phenomenal.Hell, the book is phenomenal. All I can say is that for anyone who's read Twilight and loved it as much as me, you have GOT to buy this book.

I am more than pleased with the product that I received. It surpassed my expectations immediately upon use. I truly didn't realize how many files or how much information I could fit on this flash drive. I would highly recommend this product for the person who has to utilize more than one computer to get work done. This is my very first Kingston product and they have left a very good first impression on me.

I was not sure this small camera would cut it.  It's so simpl my 6 year old son could work it without directions.The video quality is very good. Not as good as a $800-$1000 camcorder, but this think goes in your pocket. I think I will use this more than my "normal" camcorder. Software loads FROM the Camera. Simple Get one you will love this.5 Stars for sure.Mark W (NJ)

NO CHILD SAFETY MECHANISM:  If you have a young child in the house, PLEASE DO NOT put a Keurig machine in your home.  I own three different Keurig machines. I enjoy them so much that I gave my daughter and son-in-law a Keurig B60 for Christmas 2008.About a month after Christmas their two and a half year old had watched them enough times that when no one was in the kitchen he took a chair climbed up, lifted the Keurig handle up and down then started pressing buttons.  Well it was only a matter of seconds before scalding hot water was pouring out and splattering on our toddler.  I knew I had read somewhere there was a cup sensor that wouldn't allow water to come out if a cup was not present.  After calling Keurig and telling them what had happened they informed me that the "Individual Model" was the only one with that feature.  THINK ABOUT THAT -it is the only one that doesn't have a water reservoir so this incident can't happen on that model but it has the safety feature.  I told Keurig this is a huge liability and I have seriously doubt this would be an isolated case.  PLEASE if you have young children don't put this machine in your home, the consequences are not worth it.

I received my Zen-via-a-meditative-white-rectangle eight hours ago and it's been a complete and thorough disappointment.> 4 hours of charging> 1 hour of trying to make the White Rectangle Of Death (WROD) go away> 2 hours of searching the www and Creative's site for support> 1 hour of telling everyone what I think of this "creative" piece of advanced aural technologyCreative does offer an apology and directions on where to go, so I can't claim they're completely worthless.  Stick with the iPods - you pay more for the quality (i.e., they turn on and play music like you would expect), but you're not wasting time boxing up and shipping back garbage.

I have used Dragon NaturallySpeaking more than seven years, starting back with version 5. Each new version has been better, and version 9 was clearly a substantial improvement. It was fast, accurate, and reasonably stable. I use it every day for e-mail, notes, and letters. When I saw the advertisement for version 10, I trusted the ad line that it was even faster and more accurate. Besides, shouldn't my new Dell desktop with dual core Pentium processors (running Windows XP) be able to handle version 10.Wrong I was. After installing the software last week, I have experienced software lock-up every 15 or 20 minutes. Closing Dragon and restarting the software is not enough. I have to reboot my Dell to clear out memory in order to get another 15 or 20 minutes of reasonable function, until the software locks-up again.In addition, I frequently experience long (up to 15 second) delays between pronunciation of a sentence and appearance of the words on the computer screen. I will confirm that word recognition accuracy is good, even better than Dragon version 9 (which wasn't bad).  My opinion: if you are running version 9, stay with it. Version 10 is unstable and interfaces poorly with other programs such as MS Word and MS Outlook.  Version 10 still needs a lot of work before it is ready for prime time.

I have 2 Australian Shepherds, and just with a little bit of pressure their nails would stop the motor.  I am well accustomed to grooming and nail trims as a dog breeder and former vet tech.  It isn't my technique.  Dremmel tools are much more powerful.  That's what you should be using on medium and large sized breeds.  I did call customer service about their product just to see if there could be something wrong with the product.  I received mine as a gift, so I have no idea where my friend bought this product.  Customer service wouldn't even talk to me without an account with them.  When I asked to speak with a manager, she said I would have to call back in 30-45 minutes because all managers were on the phone.  I already had to wait on hold for 15 minutes to talk to her.  Evidentially they have no ability to call people back.  I've completely had it with this company and their product!

This thing is supposed to provide fresh water for your pets, right? Well we stopped using ours and went back to the old water bowl, because dust would build up on the surface of the water.  The water flow was slow, not providing good filteration.  The dish gets scummy fast, and the filters got nasty in just a couple of days.  Before long we found mold in the filer and inside the machine.  It is not easy to clean, and requires constant maintainance.  We stopped using the filer for a while and it worked a little better, but what is the point of that?  I wouldn't reccomend buying one - I'd give you ours if I could.

I can trace the start of my disappointments to about 7-8 years ago.  This was when they started what I now refer to as "Relentless Marketing".How many Quicken mail and email offers did I get each year?  Dozens.Phone calls?  Lots.For a (deluxe) product selling for about $60.But that wasn't enough.  BESIDES that there was constant blunt instrument pressure: "you should upgrade for only..."And the marketing icons on your desktop.Auto-installed trial software and demos.And more.This is the state of business today.  Customer service, support, maintenance, innovation, value: pretty much out the window.  The strategy of the day is MARKETING uber alles.  Short term thinking to make money this minute; the heck with tomorrow!Nowhere was Quicken's change of philosophy more evident than when they started Quicken Loans.  Low monthly payments.  Look how much house YOU can really buy.  You CAN have it all!How many interest-only loans do you think they made?Think they're making a lot of loans right now?Do you think Quicken will be a "mortgage-crisis" casualty?I'll bet there were a lot of mouths in that trough - how to feed them now?I speculate that the 2009 release is an effort to generate more cash, fast, before things get worse. Even if it doesn't "save" the business at least the execs will get their bonuses and golden parachutes.Somewhere I think I still have a set of floppies from 1996 or so.Used to upgrade about every 2 years.  Some new heights in the some revs, but agree with the consensus: the trend has been diminishing returns.I will maintain hope but it's sad to watch a formerly great company to continue go down the tubes.

I bought an Acer 8.9" and loved it.When this 10" came out I ordered it within days of it's release and have had it over 3 weeks now and it's perfect for me. Pros: bright screen, long battery life,wireless seems better than the 8.9, not as much gap between the screen and body as in the 8.9, has XP my favorite of all time windows, boots pretty fast,sturdy build, easy to update hard-drive and memory and mine is very very quiet.Cons: Top shows fingerprints, touch pad buttons are awkward, card reader won't read compact flash.Buy yourself a little laptop wireless mouse as the touch pad is very tiny and surf away into the night. I use MagicDisk to create virtual cd drives and Nero to create disk images and have installed Office 2007 with no problems. Overall, I don't need any more features or power then this little machine gives me.

THIS IS NOT A SCI-FI SHOW. Okay, technically it is. But the people who label it as sci-fi and dismiss it out-of-hand are missing out on one of the best dramas on television. And the people who can't forgive it for not being the hokey original series are missing out as well. Everybody needs to stop bringing their preconceived notions to the show and just let it be what what it is: a thought-provoking, nail-biting, well-planned and -written, supremely entertaining drama. That happens to be set in space. Don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a show by its genre. This one is well worth watching. You won't regret it.

Just plugged in this 500 GB ext. HDD hoping to clear out some space on my system.  Boy, did it.  When the computer mounted the drive by USB, a the drive began a small Seagate software program.  Unfortunately, this software has a bug, and began deleting files on my main drive!  It took me a while to figure out what was going on, but by then it was too late.If you're looking for 500 GB in an External Hard Disk, the price on the SeaGate FreeAgent may look too good to be true.  That's because it is.  I strongly advise looking at competing brands for a safer device.  I wish I had.

I bought the Flip Mino so that students could borrow it to use in a course that I teach at a university.  I was drawn to the Mino because of the price, ease of use, and recording duration (60 minutes).  I was also impressed with the quality of the video image.  However, when I tried to record a subject only 3 feet away talking in a normal tone of voice, the recorded volume was so low that I will not be able to use it for the purposes I intended.  Even on maximum volume and with the speakers on my PC turned all the way up, I am barely able to hear what the subject is saying on the recording.  I tried playing the recording on a different PC, but the volume was still inadequate.  I then contacted Flip customer support and sent a sample recording and was told that "this video didn't seem extraordinary." I will try to get my money back.

OK, so it is small, and a little cute... that's it? that's it.i use apple computers, and as much as i hate how everything is covered in apple logos, it is even worse to have a Windows Vista logo emblazoned across the front of this thing. i didn't think it would bother me, but it does.lets get down to brass tacks, this is the by far the slowest flash drive i have. i bench tested it myself, and the results were depressing. the sustained read averages around 19 kbps, random read about the same, sustained write about 6.5, and worst of all, random write is averages 2.7. if speed matters to you, do not buy this drive. on the other hand, if you want a cute looking, vista endorsing little drive to throw a few text files on now and then, i suppose this is the drive for you.on a brighter note, shipping was fast, and product was well packaged.

I had never juiced before, and did some online research to decide which one to purchase. I wanted something heavy duty that would juice both soft and hard foods, looked nice, was easy to use and clean, that would juice efficiently. I have been pleasantly surprised on all accounts.The Breville JEXL looks great and is stainless steel. I learned to assemble and dissassemble it readily right away, and have been thrilled at the ability to QUICKLY and efficiently juice everything I've thrown at it. The chute is wide enough to accommodate large pieces of fruit and many whole fruits and vegetables. It is easy to clean and parts can go into the dishwasher. It is surprisingly quiet, especially on the low setting. I purchased the 3 year extended warranty "just in case." I am trying to juice daily.

I just finished BD and I'm left confused and dazed. Did I read everything correctly? B&E having a child and then Jacob imprinting on said child.... that seems beyond comprehension to me. And I found the "sex scenes" to be completely retarded. Even if SM didn't want to go into detail she could have done better than "he led her into the sea and then they woke up the next morning". There was no magic between B&E like in the other three books. I mean in Eclipse we have that astounding bedroom scene between B&E and there is nothing like that in BD. But instead we get gross scenes of Bella giving "birth" and having to drink blood (when she's human). The only thing that redeems this book for me is the last third. Mainly the last few paragraphs, where Bella figures out how to let Edward read her thoughts. In fact, that scene might have been the only scene in the book that I felt even remotely reflected the past three books. Right now I'm very disappointed, but who knows maybe this will grow on me.

Looks and sounds great on the surface.  All the features seem nice and the video looks great until you play it through a TV.  I have a 40'plasma tv and the image looked terrible.  It looked like a poor digital camera mpeg.  I compared it to my cannon powershot SD 400 (regular digital camera) and the images looked the same.  Worried I was being unfair I hooked up my old sony camcorder, a DCR-101 (mini DV) from 2002, to the TV and the image was much much better.  Looking at the reviews there seem to be both positive and negative from all experience levels.  I imagine everyone should be able to tell excellent from mediocre video.  The only thing i can think of is that there must be a batch of lemons out there.  Guess i got a lemon.

I previously had a Linksys WRT54G and was moderately satisfied with it until it started exhibiting signs of 'cheapness', like general flakiness, inability to load the web management (it'd load a blank screen), etc.  After getting frustrated enough, and desiring a router with gigabit ports, I started searching, until I came across the DIR-655.The first best part (and there's more than one) of this router was unpacking it.  Honestly, it's the sexiest networking device I've seen in a long while.  There's a button hiding stealthily on the right side, if you take note, but no mention is made of it in the manual.  Also included in the package is a little black plastic stand, so you can stand the router on end - that's pretty standard for D-Link, and I like that.  They threw in a Cat-5 cable, was that a joke?  What am I going to do with a Cat-5 cable on a gigabit router?  That's very amusing.I elected not to run the software included on the CD.  There's no real need if you know what you're doing.  However, for more advanced users I'd recommend connecting the router to your computer, but NOT connecting to your internet connection (cable modem), and just spending a few minutes familiarizing yourself with your new sweet toy and all of her options.Now for the good stuff:  This router is amazing!  The main 'Setup' page is basically divided into 2 parts for each section, a 'wizard' for quick-and-easy setup, and a 'manual' page.  Basically, if you're a beginner, stick to the wizard pages.  If you wanna get up and running fast, go through the wizards, you can always go back later and manually tweak the settings to your liking.Connectivity is top level.  I tested it by transferring 25 GB of large files then 25GB of small files between two hosts connected to this router, both using 10 feet of cat6 each.  100% success, no packets lost, no fragmentation, and the transfer was about 4% faster than the same transfer straight through on an unmanaged gigabit switch.  Internet connectivity was great too.  Thanks to the built-in SPI firewall, all the 'network noise' (thanks to all the other 'dirty' hosts on comcast's network) is effectively eliminated, and honestly speeds up my internet activity significantly over what I'm used to when using the WRT54G.  Checking the logs revealed the dirty details of all this crap that's filtered out, and I like it gone.Wireless-N connectivity was also good.  Not much can be said here, it works like it should, and I have no complaints.Administration is also very nice.  As usual, the router is administered via browser, and while that's cool, I'd also like to be able to ssh into it and take care of business via CLI, but alas that is not to be.  But otherwise, the web management is well designed, fast and easy to understand.  This router also checks periodically for firmware updates and notifies you via email if you have the email settings enabled.Other items of note: VoIP works flawlessly, as does all online gaming that I tried.  Latency is noticeably reduced (on my favorite server, from about 80ms to about 60ms avg) in Half-Life 2 deathmatch.  torrents worked fine.  So far I have no real complaints about this router.  It's now my most favorite part of my network.Overall, I give this 5/5.  Honestly, I'd easily say it's worth the price I paid for it (at the time it was $140), and for my network it is a perfect match.  If you're a 'normal' computer user, don't buy this just to impress your friends; the features and complexity would be lost on you and are not worth the price.PROS:-DHCP Address Reservation-Easy administration-Quick Setup-Email logs-Incredibly easy port forwarding and per-application settings-SPI + NAT + WPA2.  Nuff said.-Great documentation and help files.-Port forwarding scheduling.CONS:-No SSH or CLI administration.-Reboot required after changing most settings.-No matching high quality D-Link cable modem to go with this.Congratulations, D-Link, on crafting yet another incredible piece of networking equipment.  The DIR-655 is worthy enough to sit on my desk, instead of crammed behind it like the Linksys was!

We love the Keurig concept for coffee making.  One cup at a time, and the coffee is always fresh!  We have this same model, and bought one for a friend that was leaving middle Georgia to go to Colorado.  She loved the coffee maker, so we bought her one to remember us by.  My wife and I love "strong" coffee, and we've found several that are "bold" enough to make a "full" cup of coffee.  Most of the flavored coffees (great in the late afternoon as a "pick-me-up) we use, we select the smaller cup size so that we can enjoy the full flavor.  This is a great product, and Amazon is one of the better places (price wise) to buy the coffee too!

This review is from: Beverly Hills Chihuahua [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      

Months before it's release, I saw the first trailer that was released. It knocked my socks off! This was a huge production number reminicent of the Busby Berkeley numbers from the Thirties films. The computer work on lip-sync and facial expressions were very natural and the music fell into place beautyfully. I waited for the films  release October 3rd. and was not dissapointed.  The big thing I did miss in the release was that they did not use the production that was used in the first trailer.  Now I wait for the DVD release,and pray they include that first trailer as a "bonus feature" in the DVD release. I have touted this film to many of my friends, and most agree as to how funny, cute, exciting,etc it is.  I would also be interested in seeing a "how it was made" feature.  I now wait for the DVD.

What a frackin awful mess.  I really liked Seasons 1 & 2.  Season 3 however was a waste of time as it barely moves the story along but instead wallows in pointless subplots and flashbacks.  What were the writers and producers smoking? Maybe two episodes are even worth watching, at most. At this point I am not sure I'll even bother with Season 4.  Don't waste your time, pass Season 3 up.

I've been using Alli now since the middle of November, and I've lost 12 pounds, on schedule with the promised 1-2 pounds of safe weight loss per week.  They have a very robust online support site for people who purchase the pills and it provides useful tracking of weight loss and encouragement in more ways than I can use.  The treatment effects that you read about are what keeps people honest with Alli and essentially make it work -- if you eat too much fat at one sitting, you'll be visiting the bathroom quite frequently.  You learn quick.  I made it through the holidays with continued weight loss, which I view as an amazing feat.  I have 13 more pounds to lose on my plan and I'll weigh what I did before I had my two kids.  Easy to use, promotes healthy eating habits and lifestyle changes, and self-critiquing when you stray from the plan.  I would recommend Alli to others -- it's a little pricy but I'm getting my money's worth out of it.

You may not need this expensive version of TurboTax if you're buying it primarily because you also have investment income (Schedule D). I realize TT has recommended this but they've recanted and told me that the 2008 Deluxe version will be every bit as capable as the 2007 Deluxe version was in guiding us through the Schedule D, C, SE and other self employment forms.Here's the dialogue:TurboTax support has been extremely responsive in calling me back regarding my complaint to them about how badly they're confusing people on which TT product to buy.I'd like you to read my question to them and then their answer. The bottom line is that TTDeluxe 2008 is every bit as comprehensive (and more) as the TTDeluxe 2007 product. There are no takeaways and no real reason for a Schedule D user to have to buy the Premiere version and no significant reason why a self-employed person MUST buy the Home/Business version. He knew their company screwed up and caused a public relations nightmare. Apparently the "recommended" upgrade products have expanded guidance and help for the uninitiated TT user.If this 2nd review of mine is not accepted by Amazon, I will try to post it to the Premiere version and the Home/Business version and also as a comment to my 1st review here.My question:Considerable confusion exists as to whether a person with investment income/transactions or self employed income absolutely needs to buy the considerably more expensive Premiere or Home/Business version. Your website indicates that the Deluxe version "includes" forms Sched. D, Sched. C, SE etc. and yet you say we should buy the more expensive program. This doesn't make sense. I'll be happy if Deluxe 2008 is as comprehensive as Deluxe 2007 was but nowhere do you compare the 2008 and 2007 versions. You are getting very bad reviews this year on Amazon because of all this confusion. People believe you are taking away function from Deluxe and raising the price to boot. Their response:"These are the actions we took to assist you in resolving your issue:I was able to express to Sam that the Deluxe program will have the same functionality as in previous years, as well as additional features as well. Sam express his confusion on the product features and that of the comparison between each of the verison of TTax. I informed Sam that he has given me a great piece of reference when relaying the changes, functions, and ease of usage within the program. I will be able to inform my supervisors on this as well as urge the response for our return customers, as well as new.Thank You Sam."

This product is a great example of world class brain dead engineers and management who've lost touch with their customers. I'm speaking of the lack of charging ability(anywhere other than the computer) like so many other customers have also written about. The thinking behind creating the inconvenience of non-chargability & making customers shop for an adapter goes directly against what technology is about(simplifying lives. The supposed improvements are minimal in my view. Apple sucks!

Do not buy from Amazon. I got the product yesterday and when I opened the package, the instrument had scratches and clearly an used item. When I called the customer service, they did not care about sending an used item and finally I have to return the product. Amazon is shipping the used product for the second time (once for the Plantronics Voyager 510 bluetooth headset). I cancelled my Amazon Prime membership but they deducted the $20 from membership fee. Beware if you buy any product from Amazon.

They are soft and chewy, not like the leathery texture I'd come to expect from this type of snack.  It's nice to have the flavor variety pack.  None of the flavors are the "bad" one that everyone leaves until last.  We just reach into the box and pick out whatever comes out.Our whole family enjoys these.  In fact, I think mom and dad eat more of these than the kids do!  They are consistently gone in much less than a month, such that I'm considering increasing our subscription order from 1 to 2!

This review is from: Wall-E (Two-Disc and BD Live) [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      

My husband and I eagerly looked forward to receiving our pre-ordered copy of Wall-E from Amazon as the trailers had given us high expectations for another excellent and entertaining PIXAR product we could share with our grandchildren. Instead what we received was a computer animated forum for advancing today's political agendas! We wanted entertainment and state of the art animation for ourselves and our grandchildren, not hackneyed political whining and attempts at mind control and thought policing of the very young and impressionable people who will watch this movie.If those of you considering buying this movie have grown steadily weary of Hollywood and the government attempting to dictate your value system through every possible venue you should definitely avoid this movie. If Disney is compelled to politicize their movies then the movies should be provided to the public at no cost as is the case with other political media.Also, are we the only ones who recognized the plot to be interestingly close to that of the Movie "Silent Running" starring Bruce Dern? And how about the names of Bruce's little robot buddies, "Huey, Dewy and Louie" and that look a lot like Wall-E?

Instead, BUY YOUR OWN BEANS (we get ours at Trader Joe's), grind em and get a reusable gold filter at Bed Bath and Beyond or Walmart, to name two retailers.

This product has served me just fine.

This is an excellent show. The writing, directing, acting, production, everything is superb! It is extremely well crafted(I love the handycam space dogfights!), the plot is better, the continuity is better, the character development is better, the acting is better, the directing is better than the original 70's series. If you consider yourself a snob when it comes to watching quality film, this will not disappoint you. Clearly, anyone criticizing this show is defending their childhood nostalgia generated from memories of the original. The only gripe I have about these/any TV show DVD season sets is how they always put the, "previously on Battlestar Galactica" scenes always at the beginning of each episode. You always have to fast forward over these to get to the start of the Episode, you cant just press the Next Chapter button on the remote, because you miss the beginning of the episode!(the part before the theme song intro, which is another annoying segment that is on every episode, strip both of these things off DVD sets! I only want to see the beginning intro once at the beginning of the set!) This is extremely annoying when you want to watch the whole thing seamlessly like one big mega 800 minute film. Which is the only way to ever watch these DVD season sets, pick a weekend, clear your schedule, and watch this epic fantastic adventure! There's one episode in season 2 that I'd dare to say is even better than Star Wars! and I'm a way bigger star wars fan than you are! But you have to start with season one! If you like Sci-Fi with Drama, Action and excellent acting stop reading this and buy this now! you wont regret it!

A few years ago, I was one of the unlucky 'early adopters' of a Linksys 4 port router (wired type) and, for almost a year, had to endure continuous firmware updates before Linksys got that router's problems fixed.  Now, again, I am an 'early adopter' of a Linksys product - the Linksys 54G wireless broadband router - and, deja vue, I am back where I was with problems with this latest piece of Linksys technology.  Two phone calls were made to Linksys tech support during which a firmware update to the 54G router and multiple resets of my cable modem and the 54G and reboots of my computer were required to get the 54G to connect on the WAN/Internet side of the router to the cable modem. I then set up the Linksys wireless-G notebook adapter and was, for a short time, able to access the internet until my laptop froze and I had to reboot.  After rebooting, no recognition of the wireless network.  I eventually got it to connect and found that the 54G router had dropped the WAN connection again and nothing I did would reestablish it - AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH! I am not willing to, again, be a paying Linksys product beta tester.  Everything is going back to the store for a refund.  By the way, I stopped using my Linksys 4 port wired router (its sitting, unused, in a drawer) and replaced it with an SMC 4 port wired router - the SMC 7004ABR - and have never had a problem with it. When SMC has a similar product to the Linksys 54G, I will try it.  After this latest Linksys dissapointment, I have decided to never buy any of their products again.

We've tried a few well-known brands of diapers and had terrible results.  It seemed like everyone that held our little boy got peed on.  So we decided to pay a little extra and try these swaddlers, and I must honestly say that the investment was well worth it! Since using these diapers he NEVER leaks through. He's dry and we don't have to change him right away if we're out shopping and he does his business. They contain it and keep him dry.  Couldn't be happier.  Too bad Pampers doesn't make them in bigger sizes.

This tape is a great idea, but the design is poorly executed.  The little plastic cylinder on the end of the tape freely slides out of the main body.  Therefore, the tape constantly slips out when holding with one hand to measure the opposite bicep.  You know that's why you're buying this, so look for a better product.  Perhaps one that spent the extra 2 cents to make the tape snap into the handle.

I have waxed myself for years.  I became totally sick of the whole process; heat up the wax, get out the strips and the baby powder, blah blah blah - then you have the clean up...not to mention, if it was bad 'waxing day' it is totally possible that you bruised yourself in the process (I've done it).So, based on the other reviews, I bought this little do-dad.  I freakin' love it!!!!  Personally I think it hurts way less than waxing!!!  You might be wondering 'where do you use it?'...answer, on my legs and bikini line - and I'm totally serious when I say that it hurts way less than waxing.  I use it about once a week or so, right after i get out of the shower.  It's quick and very effective - takes me less than 5 min to the job.  The light is awesome - the other folks were right when they told you that it really illuminates every little hair.  I guess it is a little loud, but frankly after dealing with wax - I'll put up with the sound of a little motor for the whole 5 min that i use it.  There is little to no clean up and I haven't had any issues with bumps or in-grown hairs.  If you are currently using wax and you are considering making the switch to an epilator I highly recommend this one.

Okay, it's supposed to be "compact" but it's designed with the 4 USB ports facing in all 4 directions, 90 degrees from each other, so all the items you plug in spread out to take up way too much space! See the photo - hardly compact once you have things plugged into it. Aside from that, it works like most other USB hubs. Nothing special. Many points taken off for counter-ergonomic design, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants a tidy desktop. I recommend Targus ACH103US USB 2.0 4-Port Bend-A-Hub With Mini USB Adapter (Black).

The fourth and final DVD movie shows, quite clearly, why episodic television rarely translates to feature length with any real appeal.The first movie was pretty good, the following three are abysmal. "Green Yonder" doesn't sink quite to the depths of horribleness as "Billion Backs" does, but it's got few laughs (I chuckled exactly once) and watches like an episode that's four times longer than it needed to be.I would rent or avoid this release.

In Az where we live its usually too hot to go out and grill, at least for me, so I ordered this grill thinking it would be the next best thing.  First I was surprised at how large it was, you can fix 6-8 hamburgers on it, 4-6 steaks, or whatever, its huge.  It does not smoke up the house.  Its just perfect, and I love it!!  I use it almost every other night since I got it.  I do not have to stand out in the heat, to enjoy my grilled food now.  The clean up is a bit more difficult because you do have to hand wash the grill, with an outside one, you do not, but to enjoy the fine grilled food we are having it is well worth it.  If your looking for a grill for the inside this is the one.  Remember it is large though, and finding a spot to store it away may be an issue, but I leave it on the counter, so that has not been an issue yet.

It would me MUCH simpler to just call Linksys Customer Care (You may need to call twise at toll free number(s)) and product will meet your expectations of wireless router...

Pampers swaddlers...Yes, they are expensive but you will go through less of them as they are far more absorbent than any of the leading brands. I like to think of them being "pharmaceutical grade" while other brands are "over the counter". Our newborn son had a butt rash for over two weeks, and after switching to swaddlers, within 2 days it was almost completely gone. We attribute this to the dry weave found in the diaper. It really, really works. Sure, the high cost might be eating into his college fund, but if it means Mommy and Daddy get to sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, it's worth it. Plus,  I'm sure this will pay off by not having to spend a small fortune at the plastic surgeon to remove premature aging from lack of sleep.  Give 'em a shot. You won't be disappointed.

1.  Plugged it into a USB port of my Windows Vista PC.2.  Vista did a blue-screen emergency shutdown and wouldn't boot again.3.  Techies at the computer shop got it to boot again, advised me to never ever plug that joystick in again.4.  Spent a couple of hours online looking for an update to make the stick compatible with Vista.  Consensus of the forums on the topic:  Logitech hasn't bothered to develop and release a Vista compatibility update.  5.  As a final note confirming the incompatibility, the Logitech utility application that comes with the joystick won't even load in Vista.Microsoft ought to be ashamed of the number of devices and applications they rendered useless with Vista.  Logitech ought to be ashamed for both not working on compatibility, and still marketing this thing that only works with superseded versions of Windows.

I purchased this product to replace a coffee maker that I had bought about two weeks earlier that worked poorly. The price was a little higher than I had intended to pay but based on the reviews I purchased the coffee maker. I am pleased with the design and function. The carafe pours well (no spillage issues) and the coffee is hot and remains so after brewing. There is a  temprature control so you can set how warm/hot you want the coffee. There is a programmable 'auto off' feature so you set the time you want the coffee maker to shut off.

Decided to upgrade my video camera to take to Disney World.  Had an old Sony that worked great but just wasn't practical any longer.  Wanted a camera that was smaller, lighter and recorded in a digital format.  The HD camcorders are little expensive for me right now and are still fairly new to the consumer scene.  After reading may reviews around the web I decided to go with the Canon FS100 and I would have to say I am very pleased with the performance.  The camera has everything I was looking for and the quality of the video is very good.  Daytime video is better than nightime but that is to be expected.  Overall I am very happy with the my purchase and would recommend this camera.

The pro's - it is small and really doesn't take up much counter space.  It is very easy to clean.  Like the set up of it, with the blades being the lids you screw on.The con's - it mushed veggies.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I made five batches of salsa tonight, and although some were marginally better than others, I would never serve it.  I used pulse technique a instructed.  BUT... ended up over=processing some things because other things were bouncing around whole and not getting chopped at all.  So tomatoes were total mush and onions were almost whole.This is all I have made so far, but very disappointed as I was looking forward to having fresh salsa everyday.  UPDATE - I've tried making additional things now.  It does make great scrambled eggs and veggies with cheese.Made an iced mocha and it there were small ice particles throughout drink, which I didn't like.Have learned to get better results by NOT doing things "by the book"  WHen making chicken salad or egg salad, I don't put the mayo in at all - that tends to gunk it up.  It works better in small batches, empty into bowl, and process more small batches.  Then I just add mayo, relish, whatever to the bowl itself and stir it together.  Works much better that way.Made salsa last night.  Chopped the onions seperately, took them out, then put in all the other ingredients and pulsed them, then added them in bowl with onions and mixed together.  Much better results.I would upgrade to 3 stars now.

A neat little camera that comes with a number of mounting options.Its as simple as add the memory card fit the batteries and off you go.You have to read the little booklet to ensure that you do the correct presses of the buttons on the camera to get the fuctions as the display only gives you short codes but to start and stop video is very easy.I find the cards are better download away from the camera.If you are using 2Gb cards as I was it does take some time to download from the camera using the cable transfer.The picture quality was good for a 640 x 480 video at 30 fps, I personally have not tried the other resolutions as I have not seen the need.The camera does not appear to have image stabalisation to avaoid shakes and so the video footage can give some wobble, changing where you mount the unit normally sorts this out.The sound quality is not so good but with most action shots theres a lot of noise rather than soundtrack anyway.The batteries last for about 1.5 hrs (I was using Duracell)The sealing for use underwater makes the back a little stiff, but i would recomend using the lubricant on these seals at all times which makes the removal easier easier(sparingly or it gets messy)For the price I have found it to be a good little unit for capturing some of the more unusual footage where you would not want to use a normal video camera.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I found this book to be somewhat interesting, but my biggest complaint is the lack of imagery. This book has so much potential for beautiful descriptions, but the way she just introduces places and continues the story does not do the settings justice. Indian Reservations have so much character and breath-taking views that it should be a sin to not spend time describing it to the readers that may have never gotten the chance to see one. Also the lack of description of other characters keeps me from connecting to them. Other than the odd action of mussing with their hair or comment on the paleness of the skin we really don't get a chance to see these characters. There is no image to go with them; the characters remain simply names.Also, there seems to be a lack of personal traits and idiosynchrasies. I mean chracters are nice, nosy, happy, etc, but they don't seem to posses any little perk, so to speak, that makes them... well, them. I think things such as these would make the characters more relatable. It would also bring them to life and make them more well-rounded, for as of now they are fairly one-demensional characters.

I had used this on both my dogs.  About the 4th time, my pug/westie mix started jerking towards her hind/tail area (I had put most on the back of the neck and a small portion at the base of her tail).Since we had used this product before, we first thought  she had hip or back problems so took her to the vet and specialist.  After $1500 and 4 trips to the vet, including major pain medication she was better after a few days so assumed it was just a joint/back/hip problem that got better.  The next month, right after using Advantix again, the same thing happened which led to the obvious conclusion it was an alergic reaction.  I wished I had known it could be washed off with dish soap (per the earlier review) because she had to spend another 2 days until she stopped reacting to the treatment.

I bought this router about 9 monthes ago.  I chose Netgear because they are fairly cheap and still a decent company.  I could have purchased a 3com router for approximately the same price, but went to with the WGR614 because of the mail in rebate.  After recieving this router I mailed in the rebate.  After checking online my rebate was not accepted due to the fact that I did not submit a reciept.  I did in fact send in my amazon invoice, but I guess that isn't good enough.  I'm not sure what else they could want.  If you buy from Amazon just don't expect to get you're rebate.  Other than that, this is a great product.

After using Angel Eyes on her food for one week I could already see the decrease in drainage and staining.  It also makes per go poopy less and it decreases the smell of her poo. It is a great product.

I have had this oven about 4 months or so.  I have used it to toast bread, rolls, bagels, frozen waffles and to cook pizza and use it nearly everyday.  This oven is fabulous.  It cooks very fast, takes up very little space, yet is very roomy inside.  I was lucky to find this on the Friday Sale for a great bargain, but would pay full price now knowing how awesome this machine is.  I wish I hadn't spent so much time shopping for the perfect oven and had ordered this one sooner.  Stop your research now and buy this one.  You won't be disappointed!

This keyboard worked fine at first but after about six months the keys malfuntioned. I have to hit certain keys a few times before they do anything.  I've had problems with keys sticking too, my shift key sticks a lot. It was a waste of money, I will have to throw mine out.

Last week my Razer Copperhead (2000 dpi) died and was stuck with a generic brand mouse but I saw the Amazon deal and figured to try it out.  I did not give the mouse much hope but after using it, I'm glad my Razer died or else I would not have come across this mouse.It feels great, forming to how your hand naturally sits.  The rubber siding is fantastic compared to that of Razer's plastic that gets slick.  So far there has been 0 double clicks with a single mouse click, thumbs up there. Cursor speed and smoothness feels great.If you're looking for a gamer mouse, I would definitley give this a try

Dr. Benjamin Cassuto, DVM (Banfield) recommended I give this to my cat with chronic cystitis. I sprinkle the powder into his food, and he doesn't even notice it (or doesn't mind if he does.) Although I can't know for sure how much of a role this is playing in his recovery maintenance (because he also had a course of antibiotics), at least he IS staying healthy. I believe the Cosequin is a contributor to his health at least.  (The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, is because of inability to scientifically distinguish elements.)  I plan to continue with this product, since it appears to be helping him.  Thanks

after careful consideration & tons of research, I bought this laptop direct from the hp website mostly because of the hard drive space & the huge screen. I was a bit worried that i had gotten my hopes up too high but this product absolutely did not disappoint! This is the fourth laptop computer i've owned, the others being two ibms (one bought through my university, it imploded two months after the warranty ran out) & an iBook that i absolutely hated. this computer is by far my favourite. It runs fast, quiet & smooth & the screen has such a brilliant picture! For school i use a lot of (allegedly) very high end computers for Computer Aided Design & Illustration classes, & honestly the picture on this notebook is a thousand times clearer than those more expensive machines. Vista has taken some time to get used to, but eventually i will adjust, just like i did when XP came out. This computer is an absolute steal. It's definitely the best $700 i've ever spent.

I have been thinking to buy this damn thing for a long long time. MacMall had a good deal with Bill-Me-Later. Also I recently set up a brand new Home Theater system. I connected the Airport Express to a wall socket closest to me HT, Connected it to my Onkyo 706 with a Y Analog cable and ran the setup utility. Since I already had a router, I connected router and airport wirelessly. That's it. Setup done !!! Got to iTunes and selected the Airport Express on the bottom as the output and songs started playing. Amazing!! Ok now the best thing - I was having dinner and didn't like the song that was playing. Took my iPhone out and opened "Remote" application and could change my songs on the fly! Now that is what I call a perfect setup. I am planning to hook it up with an optical Audio cable to my Onkyo. Hope that improves the quality of sound even more. Buy it if you don't have a Computer connected to your main entertainment/Music system. Highly Recommended !!

You get what you pay for I guess. The caliper is made of cheap plastic, the readings can vary greatly depending simply on how much pressure you apply. The is a small button on the left hand side of the caliper that is supposed to "click" to let you know when you have pressed hard enough. The button was out of alignment with the caliper on the one I received, you almost have to bend it to get the button into the slot. I tried using it a bunch of times but I don't have any real faith in the measurements I'm getting with it. This one is a bust.

This review is from: Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy) (DVD)
      

At first I was skeptical about a movie with very little dialogue, hell I didn't even see it in theaters, because I thought it was going to be a stupid kid's movie and I accidentally saw it during the holidays when by younger cousins came over and I was wrong. The film plays out like a Chaplin movie (Gold Rush) as in the lovable loser falls for the cold, and distant person,this case a robot and eventually the love is reciprocated) crossed with 200l: A Space Odyssey. The film is about a lone robot: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class (WALLE)who looks like the offspring of Johnny Five and a trash compacter cleaning up the earth in the future after a Wal-martesque corporation run takes over the planet and runs it into the ground. Walle after 700 years alone evolves a personality and watches the hell out of Hello Dolly and he gets lonely and wants love. * This movie has tons of extras for both film geeks and kids. * Note: the DVD box is unique and not the standard 9/16In. by 5 3/8In for those that whine about that sort of thing, also its left and right side slide out oppose to opening like a book. * The movie is a hybrid of live action and top CG animation. Two Words: Fred Willard!Plus there an original song by Peter Gabriel! Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)

The installation was a bit rocky at the start.  The "easy setup" CD simply did not work at all. It failed to detect the modem, although it was properly connected. So I called the 24/7 tech support, they answered with a message that said they had an unusually high volume of calls, and instead of queuing the call and asking me to wait, they told me to call back later and then actually disconnected me. Something's amiss in that call center. Steam was beginning to come out of my ears. I called back immediately and got right through to a very nice and very capable rep in India, who walked me through the manual setup flawlessly, and had all 4 of my various devices up and running perfectly in minutes.  In 7 days, I have experienced only one of the dreaded lock-ups requiring power-off-on reset. Seems to run faster than my old Buffalo, which had just suddenly decided to stop working. I had a pair of Buffalo units to cover the whole house, and this single unit at one end, where the cable comes in to my house, seems to be doing the same job. I have not tried to mix G and N yet, and I'm a little concerned about the review that said this is problematic.  I'll keep my fingers crossed, and report back when I get my N laptop.

I bought this little gem to increase our intake of fruit and veg. It has been nothing but great. It is easy to clean ( meaning that you have to thoroughly clean it after each use)-but it is easy. It is powerful and just "eats" the fruits and veg. The carrots are our favorite. they just dissapear. We fell 100% better than before-more energy, less weight, better moods, better skin. IT IS A GREAT MACHINE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND strongly to anyone considering juicing.

Bottom Line:  Drive failed within 1 hour.  Will return to J$R World for replacement or money back, not sure yet.  Longer Story:  Was excited about getting a product that offered both Firewire and USB capabilities.  I purchased this drive partly due to the overwhelming favorable reviews.  Maybe I just got the one in a million bad drive, but not sure I'll go back to Iomega so quickly.  This device failed within the first hour after beginning to backup documents.  My computer somehow suddently failed to recognize the drive during the transfer.  Moved drive to two other computers and somehow the drive could be recognized but not used.  Kept asking to be formatted.  When I'd attempt to format the device it  would finish by saying drive was not successfully formatted.  There was no way to get around the problem or fix it.  Drive couldn't be formatted and drive couldn't be used without being formatted.  NOTE:  I also tried it back on the same machine where it originally failed.  Still didn't work.

The pan is &quot;CHEAP&quot;.  That is, the non-stick stuff comes off.  This means, at the very least, that your bread sticks to the pan.  On the serious side, this stuff is in your bread and who knows the potential health effects of consuming it.  With the increasing incidence of many health problems including cancers, tumors, Altzheimer's, childhood diseases, who can say for sure that it's not caused by something as all-pervasive and seemingly benign as our cookware?  What about cookware that contributes little metal particles to your recipe?I haven't seen it warp yet but the V20 pan warped and I suspect that this one will warp as well over time (why wouldn't it, it's the SAME pan).  Summary: I've stopped using it and sold it at a yard sale.  Will purchase something different.

The only reason this coffee maker received two stars is for the convenience factor.  If you are considering a single serve system, run don't walk.  Run to the Tassimo by Braun.  The Tassimo reads a bar code for each type of coffee selected (latte, expresso,capaccino, etc.) and adds the perfect amount of water as well as separately steaming the milk for speciality coffee choices. You enjoy a perfect cup of coffee each time.  The Keurig, on the other hand, has a Mickey Mouse system: it only allows you to choose three cups sizes which means you get kind of watery coffee,very watery coffee,or dishwater. Our Keurig is not even worth "regifting."  We have, however, purchased a second Tassimo for our summer home and have also purchased two others as gifts.  Enjoy!

We have owned two of these.  They make perfect waffles, as many of the reviews have said.  The problem is that the top handle becomes loose.  It is attached by scres that have their heads inside the top of the waffle maker.  Once they become loose there is no way to re-tighten the handle.  Eventually it just falls off.  Our first one died within the warranty period.  The second one lasted until just beyond the warranty period.  It is a stupid design flaw on an otherwise wonderful product.

Just got the Griddler (GR-4) for Christmas, and have been putting it through some test runs.  The heating is too inconsistent due to several design flaws. These flaws are too significant for me, and I do not recommend this product. I am surprised by these design flaws, as I expected a high quality product, since this carries the "Cuisinart" name.First, the plates do not have enough mass to maintain heat. The griddle plates each weigh about 18 ounces; while the grill plates weighed 22 ounces. For comparison, I have a waffle iron with removable plates (waffle side and flat griddle side) that weigh 26 ounces, but are 10-15% smaller than the Griddler's plates.Second, the mass of the plates would not be as big as a concern if the heating element was more constantly "on." When the Griddler is ready (green light is on); the heating element turns off. The heating element does not turn on again for some time (a few to a several minutes, depending on the temperature and mass of the food being cooked).  In other words, this is like cooking on a frying pan that is heated to a certain temperature, then the pan is removed from the heat, and then the food is added to the pan. After a couple minutes, the pan is placed back on the heat source until it reaches the certain temperature. This type of on-and-off heating is fine for baking in an oven but not for a grill or griddle.Third, the heating elements are insufficient. The elements are located in a single rectangular pattern, closer to the outside of the plates, than the inside. This flaw, along with the insufficient mass of the plates, causes food(or parts of such food) placed in the center of the Griddler to be less cooked than the outside edges. This is best shown when using the Griddler as a griddle and cooking large pancakes. The part of the pancake that was on the outside edge will be golden brown, while the part that was on the inner portion of the plate will be white. A larger heating element that snaked or coiled below the plates (instead of just a rectangular pattern) would sufficiently help with more even cooking of food.Fourth, I found the temperature controls to be too low for cooking. Even at the highest setting for the griddle, pancakes would get barely golden brown. They would get done, but the color   (along with the inconsistent browning) would not make the pancakes presentable for a meal with guests.These flaws do affect other foods, not just pancakes. For example, when I tried grilling a simple panini sandwich (hot ham and cheese sandwich), the coloration and grill marks were too inconsistent (yet the ham was hot and the cheese was melted). The flaws may be less noticeable in grilling some foods, such as hamburger patties or hotdogs, where the food is usually flipped 2-3 times.In conclusion, the heating-related design flaws make this product not worth purchasing, especially if you are looking to use the product as griddle, or if "presentation" (e.g., color of food) is important to you. The Griddler may be a decent contact grill, but the uneven cooking is a deal-breaker for me. As of now, I will probably purchase a stove-top, cast iron, panini press to use instead of an electric panini grill.

Good camera & features: v small, silent, good battery life and quick to start. However, the picture quality is disapointing for both bright and darker lighting (indoor shots are very grainy).

Simply THE BEST---Betta than all the rest!  I don't know where to begin.  7-8 hours of battery power.  Very bright-clear 10.2 screen.  The volume "stereo speakers", though not as loud as full sized notebook computers---is acceptable for a 'netbook' in my opinion.  To be specific--a quality sound with a bit of bass---though not the loudest!  I purchased the Black colored netbook---which is very classy---with the silver ring around the perimeter of the machine.  I really like the LCD lights that appear on the bottom left side---which is unique vs. other netbook conputers.  Yes, while the top is glossy, it is a finger print haven---thus I keep a polishing cloth with me at all times as I'm most particulate.  The machine has a very sturdy-quality-sexy look! The speed in boot up exceeded my expectations.  This netbook is just on key--with blue-tooth (which the netbook computers in the $300 price range do not include blue-tooth and may not include a 6-cell battery.  By the way, the Samsung NC-10 does come with with a light weight suede type fold over-Samsung logoed case (you'll need something a bit more thicker and protective, trust me)*I returned the ASUS Eee 1002HA----because of:-Aluminized Casing was not necessarily all that impressive---still allowed for finger prints and was 'brown' in color.-The relocation of the 'shift key' from the typical position--I found quickly annoying.-The 2 cell battery bothered me----which was reported to allow 5 hours of usage as low-power-Very low volumeAs a self-acclaimed electronic geek-----please believe that the Samsung NC-10 is the BEST netbook out there!  Of the online reviews I've read, this netbook is rated the best----though it seems the Samsung NC-10 has a low key identity compared to the Acer, ASUS, HP and Dell.  Yes, there are some top of the price line Netbook Computers out there that cost nearly $1000, but not sure they are necessarily better---and in my opinion if you're willing to pay $1000, why not just buy a 12.1 or 13.3 full notebook computer???!!!!Fyi, I did find a Samsung DVD-R Burner online at Amazon for $79 that I purchased also.  If you choose to go the Samsung NC-10, write a review as I'm most interested in your feedback.  Have fun shopping on Amazon.com*

A better book than the first, this book introduces us to new characters that are delightful, funny and important to the story line. It deals with what happens when Edward did what he thought was the right thing - leaving Bella so that he can keep her safely out of a world that wants to kill her - and why that is such a mistake. Because their enemies still want her dead anyway! Bella sought comfort in her friendship with the adorable Jacob Black, a werewolf, and things get a little complicated. She is unwilling to let go of the friendship, but unable to will Jacob not to fall in love with her either. I especially enjoyed the Volturis. They are elegant, delightfully frightening and rife with secrets. A perfect ruling vampire coven! Oh, and Alice is the hero in this book. (Yay! she's my favorite character!) She came through in a big way for Bella, Edward and the survival of the Cullen family.The only thing I would change is cut out some of Bella's moping. (We get it. She's extremely sad. Who wouldn't be?) And add in more Volturis! But other than that, I thought this was a richer, more compelling book than the first.

I used Turbo Tax for the first time this year.  I usually do our taxes by hand, but this was much easier and I didn't need to take over the kitchen table for an entire weekend.  I liked how I was able to leave the returns and come back later to resume where I'd left off.  I also liked how Turbo Tax uses the Federal return to populate the State return, making the State return extremely quick.  I never did figure out how to make a comparison between our liability as married joint and married separate, but I don't think it would have helped us this year.  I plan to use Turbo Tax again next year.

I purchased Office 2007 Premium to upgrade my existing Office 2003 installation.  Installation went fine, and I worked with the product for a few weeks.  Then I wanted to use some templates--and found out that even though I spent a lot of money to purchase this product, IT DOES NOT COME WITH TEMPLATES!  You have to download them from MS Office online.  When I tried to download the templates (resumes, brochures, etc.) the website finds my old 2003 installation and rejects the newer version, claiming that my product key is invalid.  There is no work-around for this, and I have yet to find a solution.  In other words, if you have a previous version of Office, none of the templates or online content are available to you.How Microsoft would let a problem like this get through testing is beyond me.  It illustrates the incompetence that has become the norm for this organization (check out the Vista disaster).

I received the product undamaged. However, i failed to read the part of the description which states that is is equipped with the "u3" software. This stuff is garbage. It is too "buggy" and I have many issues trying to get the computer at work to recognize it. Work is running windows 2000 Pro. At home it did great with Vista. However the bottom line is the whole "u3" software is just bells and whistles. If you need to simply transfer non sensitive material to and from work stay away from "U3". The ICING on the cake was it died after 3 weeks of struggling with it. Taking my documents with it. Spend some more money and save yourself the headache.

Overall, it's a decent mouse. Definitely would recommend someone to try it out before buying it.I have two peeves that make this mouse fall short of being great imo. The middle click isn't so great; it's not easy to push in like my old MX510. The second is the back and forward buttons are difficult to reach and don't feel easily accessible. They don't protrude enough so that you can feel where they are with your thumb. They're in an awkward location because the mouse is a bit smaller.I miss the Scroll UP and Scroll Down buttons above and below the scroll wheel the old MX510 had but that can be overlooked. Sometimes the middle click to scroll around doesn't work properly for some reason. Like if I'm viewing a picture within windows and zoom in and try to navigate around it doesn't do it properly. It could be do to the fact that it has a scroll left and right button and the middle click is easily pressing those as you hold the middle click button down.The size is definitely not for everyone and does take some getting used to. I use the precision grip with 2 x 7gram weights in the middle and it feels solid and nice. I had to get used to holding it near the back so that I can more readily access the forward and back buttons which is a bit weird.

It is fine for kneading but when it comes to baking the dough doesn't rise enough, the bottom is overcrisped and the top looks anemic.

I was given this camera as a gift in anticipation of the homecoming of my second-born.  The camera never worked right and after 8 months of getting weird intermittent error messages and being unable to capture countless video-opps, the camera deleted my priceless Christmas footage.  I finally sat down down to trouble shoot issue (Am mother of 2 under 3) and was advised by Sony Customer Service that the disc door must be loose and I should send camera to Sony for repairs.  I was told this would cost 129$ as we were out of the warranty (although we only received the camera 8 months ago) Pretty pricey for a camera that never worked.  I would not recommend this camera and will never buy Sony again.  I hope noone ever gifts me Sony either!

this ice cream maker is easy to use and clean up - the only problem is that using whole milk, half-and-half, or real cream is very fattening, but it tastes so much better than what one gets at the market and the texture is excellent!  I have to watch myself and not get too carried away and also, give at least half of each batch away!

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

This is the second book in the Twilight Series. It is a fabulous read--keeps you on the edge of your seat. You'll be lusting after Edward or shall I say thirsting after him by the time you are done with this novel. Bella meets a new friend, Jacob, who keeps things very interesting as he is very different from Edward. Be sure to buy the third book, Eclipse, so you can start it right after you finish New Moon because the ending is a cliffhanger. I used 2 day shipping to get this book to me so I could start reading it ASAP!

I returnd my zip250, it takes too long to read 100mb disks, about 5 times slower (they told me it's slower becouse the 250 write/read head is smaller?).. I also tried reading a 100mb disk in an internal ATAPI zip 250 and it crawls..but it reads 250mb disks much faster.so dissapointing!!

It's true that the coffee is kept hot in the pot as others claim, but the problem is once it's out of the pot.  Even coffee poured right after brewing quickly gets cold.  I can't explain it, but it's true, and it makes this purchase very disappointing.  Also, the lid for the carafe is uncomfortable and difficult to turn every time you want a refill.

The My Book series is a class action lawsuit waiting to happen and I would be happy to join it. The design is so inferior that the drives get too hot and burn up - on both Mac and Windows. If it's under warranty, they send you a used, beat up replacement that someone else returned ... and the warranty does NOT start all over again. It applies only to your original piece of junk.Customer "service" is based in India and the techies can't speak English.I bought 3 of these and am considering legal action after the replacement also went belly up - very hot to the touch. It was my backup drive and now the backup is gone.I used to sing the praises of WD, but never again. They care nothing about the customer - only about how money they can screw you out of.If you have a My Book that has NOT fried yet, remove it from that horrible case so ti can stay cool. The warranty for it is worthless anyway. YouTube has a decent video on how to open the case and remove it. Search "remove My Book".

After trying unsuccessfully to use a Lynksis router with Vista, I bought this product without doing any research 5 days ago.  What a mistake!  After 4 straight days calling customer service (both D-Link and my DSL provider who kept blaming each other) with people who you can not understand, they finally figured out I needed a firmware upgrade.  After upgrading, it worked- for about 2 hours before it dropped the connection.  Do not make the same mistake I did, avoid this at all costs!  Customer service was terrible, with 20 minute waits to talk to a person.

The keyboard is the stupidest design ever. I called HP to complain about the flaw in a dark brown colored keyboard that has lettering painted in a dark brown color, which makes typing anything, especially numbers, a serious hassle. What did the non technical support manager tell me? The keyboard is not a flaw, it was intentionally designed that way. If you don't like it, then you can return the product. Nice to see how HP is out to please the customer, when apparently they feel cocky and arrogant in this economy that they can tell a customer, "If you don't like it, then buy something else." No more HP products for me, and by word of mouth I won't recommend their products to anyone else either.By the way, the same bronze colored computer sells at Sam's club, but with white letters on the keyboard. If it wasn't a design flaw, then why is the problem fixed on those computers sold at the retail giant?? My advice to anyone else is, complain to the CEO of HP, cause management doesn't care.

I'd been waiting for these laptops since the introduction of Intel processors in Macs.  The MacBook Pros used nearly the exact same case design for far too long.  While I didn't think the MacBooks really needed a design refresh, I like the choices Apple made so much that I bought one.  I like having a smaller laptop, though I do appreciate some of the additional features you get with a MacBook Pro.  That said, many of the extra bells and whistles once left out of the MacBooks have found their way in and while I never really thought I'd care I have to say--it makes a huge difference.Owning a new aluminum MacBook is a lot more like owning one of the old 12" Powerbooks.  I used to have one and it was wonderful.  It's probably the one discontinued Apple computer that's coveted by its owners.  Their resale value is still fairly high, considering how comparatively slow they are.  If you're a blogger or a writer and you don't use the machine for much else, it's sort of a best of breed.  However, with these new aluminum MacBooks I think things have changed.  You get a backlit keyboard in the higher end model (which is the one I'm reviewing), an aluminum body (of course), and a multitouch trackpad.  I think the backlit keyboard is the nicest addition.  It's really something you appreciate more once you've used it.  I've never had any difficulty typing in the dark but I can't see myself ever buying a machine without a backlit keyboard again.  It's incredibly helpful when you need to type a special character or press a function button.  If you don't have the usual key positions memorized, I imagine it's even better.  This makes the high end MacBook feel a lot more like a MacBook Pro.Regarding the aluminum unibody Apple likes to talk about so highly, it's very nice.  While they did this with the Macbook Air, it seems much more refined with the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros.  My one complaint, which I feel will fade over time, is that it sometimes looks too perfect.  I don't mean this as a backhanded compliment, but that there is such a thing as being so perfect it lacks a human touch.  Think about listening to a computer play a song versus a human.  It's just not as good.  Well, technically the computer is better but that human touch is relevant to us.  This machine is so exact and precise that it sometimes feels inhuman.  At the same time, it is rather stunning.  I think I'll get past the lack of human imperfections as I get used to looking at it each day.The multitouch trackpad is something I'm not foreign to, as I used a MacBook Air for awhile.  The new trackpad space is identical.  I found this very fortunate as I don't like buying new machines without being able to get a Marware Protection Pack as well.  Luckily I bought a MacBook Air pack and it fit perfectly.  Even the trackpad film fit.  While multitouch gestures didn't make their way into my regular routine too often, I did use them here and there and am glad they now exist throughout Apple's line of laptops.  The disadvantage of the new trackpad is the lack of a button.  Yes, the whole trackpad is a button and yes it's very clickable.  The problem is that sometimes the click doesn't register.  I turned on single and double taps for left click and right click (respectively), but sometimes those don't register as well.  If this were my first Apple laptop, I'd panic and run to the Genius Bar for help.  Since I've been through a few of these, I've found that it takes a month or two before you really break in the button.  I've had the laptop for about ten days now and it's already working better.  Still, I wish it just clicked as expected out of the box.  For those that are wondering how you click and drag if there's no actual button, you just kind of pretend there is a button.  While Apple gives you the entire trackpad for tracking, and you can click pretty much anywhere (with resistance building more and more as you move upwards), you can expect this trackpad to work just like the MacBook Air's trackpad.  The space where the Air's button would be is where you can safely rest a thumb (or whatever) for clicking.  It will not register as a second finger as easily.  If you pretend there is a button at the bottom of the trackpad, you'll quickly forget there isn't one.But those are the bells and whistles.  As far as performance goes, there's not much excitement in regards to speed.  The computer's architecture has changed, but the Core 2 Duo processors aren't really much faster (or any faster as the case may be here).  The big jump is in the new graphics processor from NVIDIA.  I'm not going to pretend to be a hardcore gamer.  I don't play many games, and especially not when it comes to those that are GPU-intensive.  I can't give you frame rates from World of Warcraft or anything like that.  What I can tell you is that the new NVIDIA graphics make for smoother performance around the operating system and seem to contribute to 1) better battery life and 2) a cooler system.One of my favorite things about this laptop is that it doesn't really get hot.  I ran an H.264 video encode today so I could put a video on my iPhone and it didn't feel hot at all.  The MacBook Air heats up in about five seconds and then cripples the GPU first, before throttling anything else, and gets pretty warm.  You could iron a shirt with the old MacBooks and I won't even start with the MacBook Pros.  I can't believe how cool this machine has been.  I'm not punishing it with endless work, but for it to make it through a twelve minute video encode without breaking a sweat is pretty amazing.  It's the first time I've used an Apple laptop and didn't worry about becoming sterile.  I don't know what they did, but it's wonderful.I get about four hours of battery life under normal usage.  While this still doesn't quite match what Apple promises, it's the highest I've ever, realistically, gotten out of an Apple laptop.  I'm more than happy with four hours.  I rarely use my laptop off of the power adapter anyhow.Another neat feature of the new MacBooks (and MacBook Pros) is that you can use your iPhone/iPod touch stereo headset with microphone to record (crappy) audio and have basic control over iTunes.  Since I swap my iPhone headphones out of the iPhone and into the laptop very frequently, this is fantastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've been interrupted and clicked the microphone on the headset to pause the song, only to remember that I can't.  Now I can.  This is wonderful.So far I've only had good things to say and that's because, overall, this is an excellent machine.  I want to talk about a few bad things, however.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw is the display.  This is why I've rated it a four and not a five.  The display is an embarrassment.  If you have any intention of doing any visual work that actually matters, this machine will be completely useless to you.  The viewing angle is so terrible that no matter where you are, you will not get even contrast.  I don't notice it quite as much when I'm surfing the web or just writing, but when I watch a video it's very apparent.  If you do visual work and it's not just for fun, do not buy this machine.  Get a MacBook Pro where it's not an issue.  Even the old MacBooks have better displays.  I don't do visual work on this machine for that reason.  If it's not critical, I might, but for the most part I work on my desktop machine instead.Another downside about the display is that it's glossy.  These look cool and all, but the reflections are obnoxious when you can't easily avoid them and you don't get very accurate color or contrast.  This is a fault of the panel itself, too, but the glossiness just ruins it further.  For general use, this isn't a big deal.  If you want to color correct or design, Apple has pretty much opted to screw you over regardless of how much you decide to spend on their hardware.  Matte screens are just not going to be an option anymore.  I think this is a stupid choice, because the people who kept Apple alive are the designers who chose Macs early on in Apple's history.  The loyalists are generally not fond of glossy screens and have been vocal about it.  I think having an option is fine, but forcing people to use glossy screens is awful.  Being a loyalist and needing a matte screen, I've just started using my laptop for everything but color critical work.  It's allowed me to prefer working on a smaller screen, which is nice because it means less computer to cart around.  I've been able to work around this problem, but my situation allowed for it.  It's still a big problem for a lot of people who can't defer to a desktop.The other disadvantage is a lack of Firewire.  While I rarely employed Firewire in my laptops, especially after using the MacBook Air (which has none), I still liked having it around.  I don't really miss that it's gone.  Again, this is primarily due to having a desktop companion that can connect with just about anything.  Whether or not this is a major issue is really up to the individual.  If you know you need it, you have your answer.  Personally, I wish Apple would've kept it until they had something better to replace it with.  Maybe they couldn't fit it into the new, slimmer casing.  I would just like to see a USB 2.0 alternative, since USB 2.0 doesn't quite live up to its claims.When it comes to upgrades and replacements, this machine gets a little better and a little worse.  If you're upgrading from a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Pro, you're getting easier upgrades all around.  If you're used to upgrades in a MacBook, however, I'd say things are better and worse.  If you want to replace RAM, you have to remove the bottom case.  It's not that hard to do but it means keeping track of quite a few screws and exposing the entirety of your machine's innards.  If you're simply replacing the hard drive, however, you can pretty much just yank it out.  One of the first things I did is replace the hard drive with a solid state disk.  They're getting cheaper and you can get a 120GB or 128GB drive for much less than what Apple offers.  But on the plus side, if you do want your computer to come with an SSD you now have that option as a custom order.  While in tests SSD hasn't really proven to have too many benefits, in real world practice it makes the machine feel much snappier.  For that reason, having an SSD is worth it.Apple's RAM upgrade prices are also not as terrible as they used to be.  At least, it seems that way.  A RAM upgrade through a third party only saves $10-20.  When spending a lot of money on a new machine, I think many people would choose the convenience over the comparatively small savings that come with doing it yourself.Anyway, that pretty much covers the majority of the relevant pros and cons of the new MacBook.  So far I love it.  I think it's a wonderfully made machine.  It's sturdy, it's attractive and it works really well.  I've very pleased with it and as long as you can handle the poor display, I highly recommend this MacBook.

When downloading music to your M250 it takes forever.  I previsouly had a creative Muvo MP3 player & the downloads was flawless.  Also the battery door is loose & rattles. When you press the buttons, sometimes it takes 2-3 presses for it to register to move onto the next song. Very annoying. I wouldn't reccommend this product to anyone. My advice is to buy a Creative Brand MP3 player since they're close to the same price. Plus they rock. I just ordered a new Muvo m100 2GB MP3 player & should have it in a few days. This SanDisk is going on eBay.

This hub is a very useful device and a good value for its current price. I have been using it for over 9 months and have connected following devices to  my laptop: 2 external hard drives, 1 external sound card, 1 keyboard, 1 wireless mouse, 1 connector for Windows Media remote. Sometimes I connect my PCTV card also.The connectivity is good but sometimes, too many devices give an error message. It happens mostly with the PCTV and one of the two hard drives. Though there are seven USB 2.0 ports, but if you connect all them to different devices, there is usually a bandwidth issue.I have not used an external power supply, so do not know how that impacts the performance. However, I doubt if that will affect the connectivity or bandwidth.There is a blue light on the hub and it can be annoying in the night, if you compuetr is in your bedroom. Either you have to turn the computer off  or mount the hub under/behind your table using the bracket they have provided. Overall, it is recommended to use.

The main reason I bought this drive instead of others is that it does not have a lid for the USB connector. The mechanism is such that if you push up the button on the side, the USB connector pops out. I found the following problems with my drive (within 3 days of use)1) The USB port on the my Kingston DataTraveler doesn't connect reliably to any USB port on any computer. There seems to be some loose contact always.2) The USB connector is supposed to "lock" so that the connector doesn't go into the device (instead of the USB female port on the computer or whatever) when you try to plug in the USB drive. The locking mechanism isn't reliable on mine and at times the connector gets pushed into the memory stick itself instead of the USB female port on my laptop.3) This USB memory device is a little big. If you have two adjacent USB ports on your computer and this device is plugged into one of them the other USB port on your computer is blocked and rendered unusable.

I could not help but notice over a hundred reviews, many short and uninformative, raving about this product posted a day apart for weeks on end. This, after Smart Money ran an expose' on false positive reviews online.That said, I did buy this in hopes of making a nasty job easier and it is a good idea. But in reality it does not really save any time and, after a month of rolling it, my wife and I ended up removing the screen and just scooping it like any other litter box. The reviews that mention that it leaks when you roll it are correct, though some litters that have less dust are not as bad. The review that states that it creates another mess by coating the inside walls with litter dust is correct also. For the product to work well, it needed to have been made of a more rigid plastic with a gasket to seal the dust in where the top and bottom connect. But even if it worked as advertised as seemingly "hundreds" of reviews would have you believe, you still have a drawer of messy litter to dispose of which means you just have one BIG scoop instead of several smaller ones, you periodically have to take it apart and scoop the litter that sticks inside, and because of the rolling, you have to take the whole thing apart and clean it as well.

I bought a yellow 4th generation nano a few months ago, and I'm VERY happy with it.  The shipping was decent, didn't take too long.  The yellow color looks gold from some angles, but I like it.  The accelerometer doesn't seem to do what it is supposed to.  They advertised that shaking your ipod will make it shuffle to a different song, but I've only been able to do that once, and I've tried a lot. That feature isn't really that useful though, so I don't mind. The design is great, the features are great. I recommend this product.

when we got the eeepc today my 15 year old daughter's first question was if it is a toy computer or a real one. most reviews here feel that $300 is sooooo cheap. actually for what you are getting its not. PRO: i was kind of impressed about the way linux was implemented on this little machine. the small display is actually not bad, bright and sharp. has just about every program you would need on the road already installed, like skype, chat clients, word processing, wlan, games, media players, etc.CON: the look and especially the feel is somewhat 'cheap'.  after only a couple hours, the mouse keys stopped to work as did the tapping function on the keypad. big bummer. the screen and the keyboard is really too small to do any kind of serious work for any length of time.all my other computers are macs, i might just be totally spoiled by the (usually) excellent apple build quality.UPDATE: after pondering if i should return this for an exchange or refund i decided to return it. for only $100 more i bought a certified reconditioned dell inspiron 1525 laptop with 15" wxga, 120gb hard drive, etc.

I'm not one to write reviews - but felt that I needed to throw in my support for this item.In December I took a chance and registered for two of these - and it was one of the best decisions I could have made. My husband and I have been using the swaddle wraps from the first day we brought our daughter home from the hospital and cannot say enough good things about them. It makes swaddling incredibly easy - and the velcro tabs are secure enough that our "wiggle worm" (as called by the Labor & Delivery nurses at the hospital) can't wriggle her way out. Our ONLY regret is that we didn't bring them to the hospital with us to use when we were there! We're now looking for a couple more - but in larger sizes and in cotton for the summer months.

Having gone through two WRT610N routers in two days, I can confirm this router is faulty and not ready for real-world use. I tested it in an environment with new MacBook Pros (gigabit ethernet and wireless N capability) and Windows PCs, and the wireless signal drops out constantly requiring me to reboot the router. At one point, after rebooting the router, it reset all of its settings to factory defaults. On other occasions the 5 Ghz band disappeared completely, requiring a reboot as well. I have experienced exactly the same problems with both routers (the first one and its replacement). So now I am forced to replace it with another brand/model.I have spoken with Linksys support supervisors and Level II technicians for hours, and none has been able to come up with a solution. Moreover, I have tried soft resets, hard resets, firmware upgrades and configuring the wireless bands with different channels and encryption types, to no avail.Please be advised that there are serious problems with the WRT610N router that Linksys needs to address immediately. It has not been thoroughly tested.

I bought this player as my first multi-media player.  I bought a Zune 30GB for my wife.  I was looking for something smaller and more compact for myself, I settled on the Zen 8GB.  This is a nice player, like many reviews say, it has a beautiful screen - bright and colorful.  Sound quality is very good - I'm not an audiophile, but I've compared it to other players and this one is right up there with the best I've heard.  The software is okay, not my favorite - I think the Zune software has the Zen software beat.  But, for basic functions it works well and is fairly easy to use.Why not 5 stars?  Two things that bug me:  one, there is no 'stop' button.  If I want to stop playing a song, I can either pause, shut the unit off, or change to a different function.  Why no stop button?  I'm confused about that.  Second, shuffle play appears to only be available as a 'global' option - meaning that you set it in the main menu and it applies to everything you play in the music menu.  I don't get this - there are some things, like audio books, that I have on here that I don't want to shuffle - why isn't this available on a per album or per artist basis?  Again, this doesn't make sense to me.Battery life appears to be good.  It would be nice if they included a cover of some kind with the player, as well as an AC adapter - but, then again, no one else seems to do that either - I guess no one wants to take the extra step to offer some bonus stuff to their potential buyers - maybe they should try reading 'The Nordstrom Way' and get some thoughts there.Overall, a good player for the money.  I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend this unit to anyone.

Alright, so I will admit it up front---I have a love/hate relationship with epilators. At the tender age of 12 or so, when I firmly told my mother I want to be hair free and demanded a razor, she instead gave me an epilator and told me that with coarse hair such as mine, shaving would be futile. After lots of tears I decided that NO, I will be just like everyone else in school and razor. After shaving through my highschool and college years, I have come to the practical conclusion that yes, momma was right and with hair like mine---COARSE, THICK,UGLY--razoring is futile. My hair grows out by midday and it's just plain nasty. So I have returned to the epilator. After using this product for a few months, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that I can go a week without the need to epilate, but alas--the ingrowns. They're there, there ugly, and there are a lot of 'em. But I've decided the ingrowns I can handle, the shaving everysinglefreakingday, I cannot. This unit keeps me hair free for about a week or so. The light whihc I thought at first was gimmicky, I've grown to love; also, the trimming head is something I use quite often. The pain isn't as bad as I remember it being from when I was twelve, and the ingrowns I am HOPING to get rid of by using Tend Skin. If this were cordless, I would give 5 stars.

I am now on my 2nd B70 at home and I have a 3rd at my office. For those who have posted that the coffee tastes watery and bland your unit is defective. The 1st one I brought home made watery coffee that tasted like bad airline coffee. We called Keurig and they said return it for an exchange. I did and the new one one made (notice past tense) great coffee and now after a month it is making watery coffee. Why I don't know seems like a pretty basic operation. The one at my office works fine. Obviously there is a defect that causes the unit to make watery coffee. So if your unit isn't making delicious coffee and tea the unit is bad. Doesn't say much for the build quality on this model.

We have two Anatolian Shepherds (double coat!) and one Aussie Shepherd (wooly coat!) as well as one large furry cat -- and all of them shed like crazy.  We use the 4-Inch model on all four pets, and all of them love to be "FURminated."  This product delivers -- the amount of hair that comes out with each brushstroke is simply amazing.  We use a vacuum while brushing to help manage the mess (even the cat allows this).  The FURminator is not a de-tangler, so when the long-coated guys are tangled or matted, that needs to be handled first, but for beautifully thinning a coat without clipping, this is the best thing I've seen.

Okay I decided to try this even though most of the reviewers recommended not to buy it.  I should of listened.  I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon.  This item is very loud, drains the batteries quickly, and the dog is petrified of it!  Sorry reviewers, I promise to listen to you next time.  For on now I will just pay the $6 fee to have my dog's nails clipped at the groomers.

I purchased these collars for my 2 Jack Russell Terriers who loved to bark at any animal late at night or at 4:30 in the morning. After receiving unsigned letters from my neighbor, I purchased the collars. Jacks are extremely smart dogs and it did not take them long to learn what happened when they barked. I am extremely pleased with the result as they have controlled their barking when not wearing the collar.

My wife bought me this mixer as a Christmas present.  It was to be an upgrade from my trusty old 4.5 quart KitchenAid mixer I've had for almost twenty years.  This new one doesn't deserve to wear the KitchenAid name.  On the weekends I bake bread and bagels.  Old trusty can plow through 5 or 6 batches of bagel dough without a problem.  The new "pro" model can't even make it through two before switching off from overheating.  Also it gives off an odor half way through the first batch.  The recipe I use is from an old issue of Cook Illustrated, in the article they state they use a KitchenAid mixer. Also the recipe uses a mere 4 cups of flour.  If you really want one of these I'm considering leaving mine at the end of the driveway with a FREE sign on it. May save my pennies for Hobart (they owned KitchenAid back when my old mixer was made.)

On May 11, 2006 Reviewer: D. Crepeau "dreamer54321" (MO)wrote: "... meaning that the "widescreen" is not true widescreen. It's the same thing as standard screen, except with black bars over the top and bottom portion of the screen.

First off, the aesthetics and form factor of this device are outstanding. It also appears to be a reasonable value given combination of portability, storage capacity and firewire 400 and usb2.0 connectivity. That's the good part. The rest of the review points out the negatives.There are several things that annoy me about this product. First up is the firewire interface. Instead of providing a standard 6 pin interface, what you get is 1 firewire 4 pin plus 1 usb 2.0 interface on the device. In order connect the drive via firewire, you are forced to use their special firewire/usb hybrid cable. The usb interface powers the device while data is passed over firewire. This is bad in case you lose the cable or just find the provided one too short. My guess is this is going to be a tough item to find at the local electronics retailer.Next, up is the capacity gauge. Why they put the thing on the "back" next to the interface ports is beyond me. Would have been much nicer to have it located up front so that you don't have to twist the device around backwards, limiting the reach of your already too short supplied cable.Final point on the capacity gauge. It is designed with 4 lights so that an active light at position 1 indicates 0%-25% full, position 2 indicates 25%-50%, and so on. Simple right? WRONG. Suppose I accidently flip the device bottom up? Now a %25 full drive appears %75 full and vice versa. Now I have to think "am I using the product the way the design engineers intended?" Would have made much more sense to have the lights fill from left to right so that lights 1,2, and 3 together would indicate %75 full. For a product aimed at apple customers, Western Digital apparently paid far too little time testing ease of use. While the drive works as advertised, there are too many annoying aspects for me to recommend the product.

This review is from: The Little Mermaid (Limited Issue) (DVD)
      

Mermaid was one of Disney's last great movies.....before they started trying to spin each classic tale into a 2nd, 3rd movie....each meaningless money making machines. The Little Mermaid is the Disney version of the Hans Christian Anderson tale. Disney brings it to life with the beautiful Ariel, and a whole cast of loveable characters- Flounder, Eric, Sebastian, Flounder, Skuttle. Ariel, the youngest of many daughters is bored with life under water and want to explore life on land as a human. She see's a man aboard a boat and falls in love. His name is Eric. When a storm rages, Ariel saves Eric and leaves his ashore. He sees her and can't forget her face. Against her fathers wishes Ariel dreams of life on land. She bargains with the sea witch Ursula to turn her into a human. The price she pays is her voice. She has to make Eric fall in love with her- but she has no voice. Ursula uses Ariels voice to bring her father to her knees. In the end, she is overcome, and Triton- Ariels father is saved, and let's Ariel go- to become a human. The music is some of the most creative animated music EVER. From Kiss the girl to Under the Sea, each songs is singable, and unforgettable. Boy and girls alike will love this movie about dreams, courage, and adventure.

This Sanyo oven has been a welcome addition to our family after deciding not to microwave anymore.  We felt lost at first without the micro but have come to like the convection oven more.  It makes delicious toasty sandwiches, reheats leftovers and can even bake a one layer cake. Very easy to clean. Doesn't take up a lot of counter space.Down side, you can't reheat that cup of coffee in the morning; but we've adapted.

Like the other reviews on this page, the new nano seems to be a step backward not forward. I usually have my Ipod in my car hooked to my stereo, now I have to bring it in each night to recharge the stupid thing becasue it can't take power from the cord it once did before. I tried it in my girlfriends stereo (different brand) same thing. I have never really been happy with Apple products and this just solidified the fact that I will probably never buy from them again. As for now my 1st generation 2GB nano will stay in my car and my "new" 16GB nano will be a paper weight on my desk until the few times I go snowboarding and use it.a waste of $200 if you ask me.

This review is from: Slumdog Millionaire [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      

Jamal Malik is only one correct answer away from winning 20 million rupees on India's version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" He's a waif and tea-server from India's slums, so the show's producers think that he's cheated. As they nearly beat Jamal to death, the movie repeatedly flashes back to his early childhood and the random events seared in his memory that enabled him to answer the show's arcane questions. But Slumdog is not about how he could answer the game show questions but why he became a contestant in the first place. He's clearly not interested in the money itself. This remarkable film is many things -- action thriller, human drama, social commentary on contemporary India, a story of human destiny, and, most of all, a tender romance. Slumdog is far and away one of the best films of the year.

I just bought a 17" Macbook Pro from a local reseller.  This is my first Apple and I am replacing a Toshiba Satellite that has done me justice for these past 7 years.   I guess I can say my first 1 HOUR experience with this Apple was not so cozy.  The screen had troubles.  The brightness basically did not come to life... it never reached a brightness that I could see the menues on the screen completely.  Tried everything, brightness control, restart, everything the manual instructed.   I called Apple tech support, and the lady on the phone simply was short and unhelpful to me and left me with a unpositive experience (mind you I was open for suggestions and help because I reallllly wanted to get this cool computer to work).  So I took it back to the reseller and hopefully they do me justice...  they need to make sure they get an "RA" number from Apple before they can do anything.  Luckily, the second Apple tech support person I called from the reseller was a little more helpful but the computer still was broken out of the box.  So, the ball is in Apple's court I guess.  I hope that Apple will do the right thing and give an "RA" to the reseller and  just replace this computer with a "new" one.  So, this review will be completed at a later date, either with a Macbook Pro in hand or another brand i.e. Toshiba.

I loved Twilight! I thought the middle books were ok. This last book made me crazy! I know this is ridiculous but I was actually mad half way into this book!First, I don't know if I am the first to say this or not but, after book 2 I didn't feel there was any substance to Edward and Bella. He thinks she's beautiful, she can't believe he wants her, and so on. They mostly disagreed and had awkward moments. Jacob and Bella were truly friends, they had honest exchanges. Maybe I am a cynic but the "true love, soulmate" thing didn't hold for me. I kinda hoped the 4th book would give Edward and Bella more substance because I was, of course, rooting for Edward. This last book did nothing of the sort!I felt the pregnancy was a bad plot twist. I suppose in a way it made Bella less selfish but only slightly. The worst plot twist was Jacob imprinting on Renesmee. I was truly disgusted. I also felt it was a cheap way to let Bella off the hook. She really had no conflict in this book that she did in previous books. The imprinting allowed Bella to have quite literally everything without losing a thing. Well, I guess she lost her humanity.After Bella becomes a vampire she becomes maybe slightly less whiny but she loses everything that was Bella. Too quickly she's an unrecognizable character. Instead of being unsure, whiny, self centered and self sacrificing, Bella becomes a perfect, surprisingly controlled, motherly vampire. WHAT?!?!?Edward is like a wall flower. Jacob is suddenly over everything because he's imprinted on Bella's infant child. All too quickly, Edward even moves past that disgusting detail. Rosalie becomes even more creepy. Ugh, I just can't believe how disappointing this book was!!Lastly, the writing... Lacking for lack of a better word. Lacking detail, lacking focus, lacking direction. It seemed scattered. The end was anti-climatic. Any build-up was wasted. So there you have it. I will still be watching the Twilight movie when it comes out this month and I hope they do a good job with it.

I was a Pampers lover,but not anymore. I used Pampers diaper more than three years for my first one and again for second one. But, it looks like the company makes thin diaper recently. As another mom says,"if the diaper gets too full, they just burst and the absorbant material goes everywhere." I absolutely agree with her. Therefore, I cancelled subscription and changed to another brand.

Leider ist die Gre 7 von Pampers nicht wirklich grer als die hier in Europa angebotene Gre 6. Sie ist, was das Saugvlies betrifft, eher schmaler und dnner. Welche Alternativen bieten sich den Eltern von einnssenden Schulkindern?Z.B. eine zustzliche Vlieswindel mit in die Pampers legen und ggf. ein Gummihschen drber -- besonders dann, wenn sich die Verschlsse aufgrund des gewachsenen Kinderkrpers nicht mehr schlieen lassen. Ist vielleicht nicht die Ideallsung, aber allemal besser als dem P&G-Konzern fr eine minderwertige Windel (Gr. 7) das Geld in den Rachen zu schieben.

My 21 year old daughter bought me the entire set of books.  She is enamored with Edward.  I understand.  He's a very compelling character - he's beautiful, perfect, brilliant, protective, inhumanely strong and agile, enigmatic, the ultimate bad-boy with a heart of gold, and he has an amazing backstory and an inhumanly beautiful, loyal and loving adopted family.  I get it - he's every adolescent girl's dream.  And wonder of wonders, he never ages.  The series is more or less about the inexplicable attraction of soul mates, inexplicable because I cannot for the life of me figure out what makes Bella attractive aside from the fact that Edward can't read her mind and she smells enticing.  Perhaps it's my age, but I believe three things - the first is regarding a work of fantasy - an author must stay true to his or her fantasy.  You cannot break the your own rules to give the reader what you think the reader wants.  A fantasy is exactly that, make-believe...a dream, but even so, as a writer you must stay true to the rules you establish for your own fantasy.  Ms. Meyer breaks her own rules.Second, characters must develop and mature.  There must be a larger reason for events in a story and that larger reason cannot simply be so the hero can constantly save the heroine - which is the case here.  It gets very old.  Bella does not change and grow.  From beginning to end she remains the same apathetic, cynical, whiny, helpless, martyred female she was when she arrived in Forks.  Except when she's with Edward and then she superglues herself to his side in a manner that seems much more like the way a drug addict needs a fix than true love.  She gets her happy ending but I'm left wondering what she will do with it.  Anything redeeming?  I very much doubt it.Third, I want my characters fleshed out.  In my opinion, Jacob was the most three-dimensional character in the entire series and at times he was written in such a way that he became almost repellent to me.  Throughout all four books, the same superficial descriptive words, the same sappy love-sick-puppy feelings that are supposed to pass for mature, timeless love, the same scenes are repeated ad nauseam.  I would have liked to see the Cullens, other than Carlisle, do more with the their eternal existence than simply repeating experiences and 'hunting'.  Oh, and saving Bella for some unknown reason.  I assume they became attached to Bella because they loved Edward and he loved her, so as Laurent said to Bella in the second book - she was kind of a pet of theirs.  I expect more from my female leads. Through four books I wanted Bella to mature, to become more 'human' than she was when the series began.  But I'm sorry to say she never did.  Edward always seemed more human and more compassionate to me and his character was diminished as the series went on.  If you can get past the flawed writing, the concept works, especially in the first book.  Other than Jacob Black, I was disappointed with the remainder of the story.  Vampire world ain't all that exciting.  From what I could tell, their larger society consisted of a bunch of overgrown, temper-tantrum prone, immature, super-powered children (I'm including the ancient vampires with the papery skin) who murder a lot of people.  Their rules are simple - keep the secret.  That's it folks.   Would it be too much to expect that after living for millennia these vampires might develop some special perspective or philosophy greater  than - we don't eat the neighbors?Okay, rant finished.

I've been a Logitech gaming-mouse user/lover for a long time. In fact, the last four mice I've used with my gaming rig have been the MX510 (Blue), MX518, G5 (1st version) and now the G9.The G9 is the perfect combination of the old G5 (precision, accuracy and on-the-fly resolution adjustments) and the MX revolution (with that killer mouse wheel), stuffed into in a customizable, comfortable and easy to control form factor.Pros:-	I really like the new weight style much better than the G5. The weight "tray" is hidden under the grip so there is no way it can just pop out like on the previous generation mouse. For me, a properly weighted mouse is key in FPS. Too light and you are all over the screen. Too heavy and you are too late. -	Not only can you change the weights, but you can also change the grips to suit your playing style and the color of the LED indicators. I prefer the Wide Load grip for my big hands and the blue LEDs to match my Microsoft Reclusa Gaming Keyboard (Black). -	As long as you are a "righty", it's very comfortable, even after some marathoning. Like all previous Logitech mice I've owned, ergonomics and comfort are never lost in the design. -	Another great addition is the ability to save up to 5 profiles to the mouse's internal memory. No drivers or software needed to load up your custom mouse settings. There is a switch on the bottom that lets you toggle through your profiles. Perfect for LAN parties when you might not be gaming on your own rig. -	Scrolling with the Micro Gear is a blast when not gaming. There is a switch under the mouse that lets you toggle between what I call the "click" mode (a must for weapon changing in FPS) and the "scroll" mode (a must for scrolling web pages and long documents).-	The gaming-feet surface is much improved. I use this mouse with a SteelSeries SteelPad QcK+ mouse pad and it is smooth as butter. I eventually plan on moving to a solid surface pad as I've heard they can improve accuracy with less friction.-	There are two thumb buttons on the left side. I know this was added to newer model G5 (my older version didn't have this) and it's a warm welcome. These are a must for forward/back functionality when you browse the web.Cons:-	The Setpoint software is a little flaky. I chalk this up to being an early release. It took a couple reinstalls to finally get it to work correctly. Its possible previous software versions on my PC caused this issue. Everything works now. -	I can't use my wrist pad with this mouse. I know it sounds weird, but the back of the mouse isn't as long as the G5 and it slopes downward in a way that forces your wrist to touch your mouse pad. Because of this, it works best without an elevated wrist pad behind it. If you do try to elevate your wrist/forearm, it can be pretty uncomfortable. No biggie, I'll make due.- $100 price. Ouch, but I've gotta have the latest and greatest.So there you have it. I'll update this review as I put it through more testing. Be sure to check out the customer photos section. I took some photos of the G9 side-by-side with my old G5. Enjoy!

If I can stop just one person from buying an Attack 3, I'll be satisfied. Thinking that third time's a charm, I'm on my third stick in five months. Same problem every time. It's fine for a week, until like others have said, the X-axis starts behaving erratically, and eventually becomes uncontrollably wild. I've even gone so far as using third-party software to try and adjust the dead-zones and calibration readings. Alas, the Attack 3 overcomes them all, the sensor readings are rabidly epileptic, and beyond help. If you're looking for a budget stick, STAY AWAY. If you own one, take it back, it doesn't get better or 'settle in'. This stick is going back for the third time and I will no longer buy any Logitech products. I'd have been happy to pay an extra $20 for a well made, durable controller, but Logitech have contracts with every major store to sell this piece of junk and other, slightly higher priced junk, so buying an alternative brand is a hassle, a goose chase and a long drive.Edit: To electronics fan - you misread my review. The Attack 3 works great - for about a week. Try using it for something that requires quick changes in direction for long periods of time, a racing game for example. You can't exactly test out the stick gently ambling along in a 747. The calibration readings become erratic and then unusable. It's not my system, because there's other reviewers out there that have the same problems. Search Google. I'll say it again - a cheap stick, with cheap components and awful quality control. Best avoided.

I have had an awful experience with this camcorder worse yet with Sony Custome Service. I shot multiple tapes of irreplacable content and discovered that the transport was defective and that the mic pics up a constant rumble. Sony customer service was completely unresponsive and refused to replace the camera but insisted a service call of indeterminate length was what was in order. They had me appeal to their "Executive Review Board". Their answer was a curt "Service  take it or leave it" I won't ever buy another Sony product. I urge you to do the same. P.S.  The cameras performance wasn't anything special either.

I love this little camera.  Fits in the hand, easy to use, and captures nice looking video.  What I like best of all, though, is how easily it connects to my MacBook Pro for uploading video and editing on iMovie '08.  I simply plug it in to the USB port with the cable provided and swith from REC mode to PLAY mode.  The camera asks if I want to "Playback on PC".  I click OK and open iMovie '08.  iMovie recognizes the camera and asks if I would like to upload my clips.  Done!In the past, I never got much into video editing with my tape based camera and a PC.  Uploading / editing clips was too time consuming.  Now with my new setup, it's a pleasure and I've made tons of little movies of our family outings and school plays.  This camera and iMovie turned computer-based video editing from frustrating to fun.  Thank you!

I am returning the second player in two months, both played for a week or so then died.  I am not getting another one.i got this for my daughter for Christmas, thinking "why buy an $$$ Ipod" for a kid in middle school who might easily misplace it or have it stolen?  The reviews of the 1 gig were great. 2gig sounded better.Within a month it stopped working.  The screen was an unreadable smear.  Amazon promptly took it back, sent a new one.  daughter was slow to reload it (disgusted with previous failure)  two weeks later it wont start.  checked the battery, its still good.we are done with this.  Customer service may be great but having it fail and having to return the dang thing (and deal with angst about "what did i do to it?" answer: nothing.  Other reviews note how durable it is.

Had there been some documentation (manual, brochure, booklet or something) with this router besides just the CD setup wizard, I may have given it 5 stars. I already knew how to hook it up to my cable modem and computer but configuring it was not easy for me. The wizard proceeded to lead me through a simple configuration which I followed but when I finished, I had "excellent signal strength" but couldn't sign on to the internet. I called tech support and a technician with a foreign dialect talked me through a manual configuration in about 30 minutes. I know more now than I did, but I'm still not sure what all we did...but I'll learn. I searched the Linksys web site and found an 84 page User Guide which I printed. I had trouble downloading the latest firmware but after disabling my firewall, it downloaded in less than a minute. The router is working perfectly and I can access the internet on my laptop from anywhere in our 1900 sq. ft. condo. Tech support was very good. My chief complaint is that there was no printed documentation with which to educate myself. It seems to be a good router though.

In terms of what it's used for I think it's good (not great). Some pros and cons:Pros:-It brews coffee really fast.-Thermal carafe is an excellent. keeps warm for long time.-Timer comes in very handyCons:-I had to exchange due to leak in the carafe lid and even the exchaned one is leaking too (not as bad as first one though). it's an internal leak where water/coffee sips into the lid whereI can't get it out. this is the reason for 2star.-Too tall. it barely fints under my kitchen cabinet (miner)-puring the water is not as good as other coffee makers I've used before. there is no way to measure water amout you are pouring unless you use measuring cup.Anyways, that's my review. if it was for lid leaking I would say it would get 3 stars but leaking lid is not acceptable, especially 2 in a row.

The wireless access always drops your connection.  I tried experimenting with G only, B only, and mixed all to no improvement.  I tried upgrading the firmware only to find no improvement.  Its absolutly maddening to consistently lose your connection to your router ever 2 minutes at times.  Other times are even worse, I have to connect to my neighbor because my wireless won't even acknowledge me.  It will show full bars for signal strength and still no use.  Another friend of mine had a similar experiences with this, went out and bought the most generic brand-X router, a motorola but I don't think he has wireless-G on it. He has no problem with a great stable connection now and I'm purple with jealousy.

I installed and tried to use this new version.  The user interface is completely different.  I went online at Microsoft to see what this was all about.  They call it a "Ribbon".  What a mess.  I can't find anything.It seems like it takes me so much extra time to do the most basic operations.  If you have an older version of Office and it is working well for you, I highly recommend just sticking with it until Microsoft fixes it somehow.  After reading reviews at other sites, I can't believe it actually had 4 stars on Amazon.  On CNET, it was 5 out of 10.  I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it.  I felt like I was driving a car with square wheels.  If it isn't broken, don't break it.  The file conversion thing is also a lot of trouble to deal with.

We've had two of this model pedometer, and several other types before. Plus features: Excellent step counting capability, the unit seems to be able to stay within 1% of the actual steps taken, and this is maybe 5 times better than others I have used. The distance calculation for all of them should be the same, and accurate, depending on the stride length used. The finish on this product is EXCELLENT, suggesting the overall quality of the product. No problems so far.The design capability is somewhat unique. The pedometer starts reading automatically every day, and keeps values until reset, making it excellent for step counting folks. It also indicated distance, overall steps, cardio steps, calories consumed, clock time, and steps taken for days of the last week. Other values except steps taken are not retained. I think I have these right. No indication of walking speed however.Overall, excellent quality and value!

I tried everything.  After figuring out what my cat's favorite kind of treat was, I loaded the ball with them.  My cat simply didn't care.  He looked at it for a couple seconds and walked away from it.  I then added some catnip.  He played with it for maybe seven or eight seconds and lost interest.  I tried catnip spray, tossing it to the cat, attaching it to a string and any number of other tricks, but nothing worked.  I thought that it would give my indoor cat some exercise, but nothing helped.  He just couldn't be bothered.  I then gave it to a friend with multiple cats.  My friend actually had some luck.  I guess that his cats were concerned that the other cats would get the treats first, so they actually used the ball and managed to get some treats out of it.In short, the only reason that a cat would use this ball, at least as far as my experience can demonstrate, is so that another cat will not be able to get the treats within.  It is an ugly statement about the nature of cats (just kidding).I guess that my family will be sticking with fuzzy strings on the ends of sticks for our cat.

I have to question whether some truly understand what they are reading.  The qualms that people are having over certain aspects of BD can be explained in the first three books.  Take some time and read (REALLY read), and maybe BD will make more sense to those that hated the book.  I personally loved the series and found it quite enjoyable.  It could be due to the fact that I realize that it is a work of fiction and anything the author wants to happen can.

Nice product, looking-forward to 8GB from SanDisk.  I like the retractable connector, but it is tight-fitting for older USB ports; don't know why.  The included software seems like a good idea, and can be deleted.  The company needs to do a better job explaining how, because it seems there are some possible problems you could cause yourself.  I bought one each of these for the research team, and it makes backup much easier to know they have most of their user files locally stored.  I'm traveling between multiple offices and using multiple platforms, and now I just keep everything on the stick and do a tar cvf archive.tar whenever I'm on the main office machine.  Nice look, nice feel, very nice!

I bought 2 of these to use for backup purposes. Neither would format using Mac OS X (10.5.6). I tried 3 different Macs ('07 Macbook, '09 Macbook Pro, and an '05 G5) and several hard drive utilities. In each case the partition could not be edited and the format would spit an error near the end. The drive itself is very attractive, if you care. If they don't work, however, you're buying an expensive paperweight.Now it remains to be seen if Amazon will be charging me for shipping. If so, I will be absolutely livid. The product description is FALSE.

I gave the book two stars because the author knows how to write and how to entice a young audience by using "Romeo and Juliet" for her outline, but other than that, the series is all fluff and doesn't even include accurate information. For instance, who ever heard of an elk bull (not buck--that's deer) with two dozen points (and they're tines, not antlers)? Unbelievable! Someone needs to do a bit of research before they write stuff like that. Since it's a fantasy romance series, it really doesn't matter whether or not an imaginary vampire can impregnate the main character, etc., but at least the author should get real facts straight.Other than that, everything in the story is predictable, the main character is so stupid, whiny and fragile that you want to slap her, and like other people mentioned, there's really no appeal to her whatsoever, so why would the other characters in the story find her so alluring? I hope teenage girls are smarter than this and don't look to this character as a hero. The sad thing is that teenagers will infer from the book that people are liked because of their looks and not because they are of strong character or because they can communicate effectively with others. The lack of communication within relationships in the story was quite disturbing, but apparently that's why romances sell so well.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

After reading this book and Twilight, I have come to the conclusion that what makes these books so appealing to young GIRL readers is their simplicity in structure.  Overall, I thought New Moon was an enjoyable read, but not because it was so thought provoking and unpredictable--only because it was so simple and easy to read (a true beach read).  Bella closely resembles a Harlequin Romance Heroine--unable to function without her man.  I like the author's "cryptic" naming of Bella-meaning a "beautiful swan"; however, I just wish she were a "beautiful swan".  Instead, she is pandering to the wants and desires of a man-rather than being a strong female (and a good role model for all the young girls reading this novel)  I just wish in this book her protracted state of despair over Edward's leaving wouldn't have been quite so, well, protracted!  I sincerely hope that Stephenie Meyers gives Bella a little more pizazz and spunk in the next book.  I can't honestly recommend this to any young girl because of the "need my man to survive" effect that rings throughout the entire novel.

Where to start....????  SO many things are messed up in Office 2007.Here are my top 3:#1: Word/Excel/PPt: The ribbon interface changes things around so drastically that doing what was once simple things in Office XP/2003 is now a frustrating exercise in lost time and productivity.  #2: Excel:  First, MS has a hotfix (a 32 MB download) for a math error (yes a math error).  Very few users will ever be likely to hit that value range on a calculated result, but still unacceptable for a mainstream number crunching program. But if you are one of those unfortunates, and the error ocurrs in a very large, complex spreadsheet, then the error could cost a business a fortune if it's not caught.#3: Excel crashes if you try to specify a custom value range for chart error bars by selecting the appropriate row/columns from the worksheet (like you can in previous versions)... you have to enter them manually by typing the arcane "=Sheet1!$A$1:$Z$1".  Even if you try to click over to the worksheet while the entry box is open Excel will crash and you lose everything since the last Save.  This bug is probably lurking in other areas as many functions make the same calls to a common software modules where the bug really is located.There are many other bugs in this product too numerous to list here (goto the MS Discussion Groups on Office 2007 for more).Do not buy MS Office 2007 unless you like PAIN!!

I received this camcorder as a gift for Christmas and have been totally blown away by it's ease of use, image quality and battery life.  The majority of functions were totally intuitive and I was able to find them with minimum fuss and without referring to the manual.  The camera has a good fit in my hand and I love the toggle navigation style, but someone with bigger hands might have issues.  Most useful aspect so far is my ability to take high-quality pics through a microscopic eyepiece.  You can take microscopic pics with a broad array of cameras, digital and otherwise, but the quality of these images is really amazing and useful to me as a student.

I searched for nearly two weeks for a new coffee make after my old style cuisinart grind and brew broke down (you know the one that looks like a deranged mushroom on top).  Anyway, I bought a mister coffee with the thermal carafe?  Big mistake, returned that POS and bought a 10 dollar toastmaster to tide me over until I could find something better.  Then I wanted the Braun flavorselect, but they stopped making it.  I saw this little puppy in my local BJ's so I came on here and looked at the reviews.  The only bad thing I could find in the reviews was "you cant see how much water is in it..".  come on folks, if that's a deciding factor for buying a coffee maker, we have to seriously reevaluate our lives.  Anyway, it's not true, you can see how much is in there, but who cares, I always measure my water on the pot?  (so you find you put too much in, what are you going to do, tip the whole machine into the sink?!) Anyway great features (what with the 1-4 cup thing, programmability, clockey goodness, adjustable burner plate temp).  And Ive yet to have a bad cup o joe come out of it.  This bad boy gets 6 stars.

7-4-2007.  Transformers made it to the big screen as perhaps the best movie of the year (not taking anything from Spiderman 3).  I myself saw it twice and enjoyed it each time.

I had to use an old keyboard that the keys stick until I could get a new one.If you don't have $50 to throw away then I wouldn't recomend this keyboard.

Season 3 of the new Battlestar Galactica is, if anything, even darker than the rest of the series.  And this in a series that reduces the entire known human population (except for us pesky Earthlings) to less than 60,000 in the first episode of the show!Well acted, especially at the ends of the season, BSG continues to shine in Season 3.  The middle gets a little heavy, too much emotional baggage for some.  But, it can't be All Starship Combat, All the Time!  The characters, even those who are Cylons, are flawed, human, and very relatable.Well worth the time to sit through it all ... and the bonus features are, as always, very interesting.

It feels like a 750 page bird crap landed on my head.  Like many fans have already said, Jacob imprinting on their child, get an abortion and you can have sex with my wife, the creepy way the baby was talking to them so early, the name Nessie. I could go on and on.  Man this book could have been so much better. Absolutlely no magic.  I think I will toss it in the fire and keep re-reading the other 3.

I was also told that a small download from Seagate wd enable her to access the desktop feature that pc's cd access right off.  Well, her Powerbook never did recognize or acknowledge that she had plugged in the hd. So, I decided to order from Amazon the same Seagate 500 gig  hd but especially for Mac. Guess what?  Same results.  Yes, her Powerbook does meet the requirements which Seagate recommends.  This product may be ok for Macbooks and Macbook Pros, but it does not seem to work very well with the Powerbook as it claims it should.  I told her to pack it up and return it.

This is a great HD camcorder for its size and price. The camcorder is great on daylight but just good on night/dark places. A consideration when buying this camcorder is a powerful pc because the pc requirements for editing and viewing AVCHD format is high. Also, there are only limited softwares available for AVCHD editing and the others are quite expensive. But if you're not into editing, you can view it into your regular tv via cables provided or to your HDTV but you need to buy a separate mini HDMI to HDMI cable.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, with the price and not to mention the free 2nd day delivery and 4GB SDHC memory card by Amazon. I love it!

What a waste of the huge talent line up! The first 10 minutes are indeed funny as many have pointed out but it's downhill all the way thereafter - 2 hours of downhill. Perhaps I didn't understand things. I'm a Brit and have lived in the US for 15 years and should have no problem with comprehension. I understood about 50% of what was said - and 100% of the frequent use of the F and S words. Steve Coogan, the wonderful Alan Partridge, was completely wasted.Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't bother to go to a theater. This is an expensive waste of time.

i want to give this a higher rating as it is reasonably priced and fulfills a niche that is necessary.  my particular machine at least is not so "ultra quiet".  i read the manual and tried their suggestions about how to make it less noisy.  i think the noticeable noise is just part of the design.  it is definitely noticeable when the living room gets quiet.  i know they could have designed this to be truly "ultra quiet". too bad.  i probably end up junking this machine when the annoyance of the machine grows to be too much.  i bought it so cheap at $16.99, that it is not worth the hassle to package and ship it back.

I am writing this after having seen the film, but before the DVD has come out. I know how much cinephiles loathe this film, but, dudes, loosen up! Sure, it is more than a little "sappy", but take some time out to be "sappy and happy" viewing this movie! The adventures of these chihuahuas, other dogs, and assorted animals is a delight, especially for those who have a "tender spot" for the hounds! This movie never was meant to appeal to the viewer's sophistication. On the other hand, it is not any sort of "chihuahua exploitation film", either. My favourite hounds in this California-Mexico romp are Pap, Chlo's ardent male admirer and very determinedly valient chihuahua, and Delgado, the down-on-his-luck, butch German shepherd who comes to the rescue and various acts of kindness for Chlo, even when he misinterprets the reasons for Chlo's second disappearance. Then, too, who cannot love the thronging hoarde of chihauhuas among the ruins of an ancient indigenous culture? Seeing Chlo try to find the mighty voice of her "inner chihuahua" (as opposed to pampered pet squeaks and whimpering) with the aid of the leader of this pack of chihuahuas is very amusing; I wish that this bit of animal humour had been more extended! This is a pack of fun, and not just for children! Have a barking good time watching this film, in the theatre or at home!

I was incredibly disappointed by the third installment in this series.  I loved "Twilight" and liked "New Moon."  However, I ended up putting down "Eclipse" about 3/4 of the way through.  It seemed like everything in this book wasn't as good as it was in the first 2 - the writing, the characters, the plot.  I found myself simply not liking ANY of the major characters.  Bella is whiny and needy, Edward is controlling beyond belief, Jacob is not even the same character we first met in "Twilight."  The writing itself is bland and unimaginative.  I finally decided to stop reading the book when I realized that I just didn't care what happened.  Another reviewer wrote that they wished they had stopped reading the series with number 1, and I have to agree.

This coffeemaker makes great coffee, but it is too tall which makes filling the water reservoir difficult. However, the biggest problem is the leakage of water from the steam under the lid of the unit. It leaks water every time you raise the lid even if you let it sit for hours after brewing the coffee. The water tends to leak down the backside of the unit and all over the electrical cord. I wish I had listened when I read the other reviews on this item as others had already had the same complaint. It is not just a LITTLE water, but a real electrical hazard to say nothing of the constant mop up it needs each time you brew coffee!

I was so skeptical about this at first. I been searching FOREVER to a solution to my snoring and when I stumbled upon this on a blog on cures for snoring I gave it a try. I used to have to sleep in the guest room every night which killed any intimacy I had with my wife.  I really thought that she would leave me....even my kids had to sleep with pillows over their ears. Our family of 4 is very grateful for this item and my wife would like to thank AntiSnore for helping me find my way back to our bed. A++++

I have always used Toshiba Brand, the last one I owned ( which was stolen ) was incredible with 2 GB RAM a COre 2 Duo processor 1.86 speed, this Vaio is 3GB in RAM 2.0GHZ Core 2 Duo Processor and the performance is about half of the Toshiba. I expected a lot more power in everyway but I am a little disappointed to check at a poor performance. My wife owns a Toshiba with a 1.5GHZ AMD Turion processor and 3GB RAm is about 3 years old and works almost the same as this one.... Sony is an expensive brand, but that does not mean you will receive what you expected for the price....

I bought the bread machine with the highest rating, so had high expectations. My first loaf was a soggy, compact, 2 inch high reject with no browning on the top crust. I discovered that most if not all of the yeast was still in the yeast dispenser. The next day I made another attempt. This time I mixed the yeast with a small amount of the flour and put it in the bottom of the pan. I also checked the temperature of the water and raised it to 72 degrees F. (My tap water is 55.) Imagine my disappointment when the nice smelling loaf turned out to be another soggy dud! Sorry. I do better the old fashioned way. I'm returning the bread machine.

No matter how long this movie is it still wasn't long enough to be true to the book. How could they cut two of Scarlett's children? I'm so glad I read the book first because if I'd seen this mess first I probably never would have bothered. The book was just cut to pieces. And this movie is a classic?      Vivian Leigh was a terrible Scarlett. I could hardly stand to watch her. This movie was overacted and just plain terrible. Read the book instead. At least then you get the whole, complete story.

I love this slow cooker! You can brown your roasts and get a bunch of yummy fond, toss in the remaining ingredients, stick the pot in the base and you've got a real roast when you come home. I had to upgrade to this larger size due to family eating more (you get that when kids grow!) and I wouldn't even consider switching to any other style of slow cooker. I even use it as a bean pot to make baked beans in the oven and for fondue parties. This thing is so wonderfully versatile: make a stew richer by finishing it off in the oven, no new pan needed. My husband brings it to work for potlucks and I've never have a problem cleaning it. There's only one thing: I don't just stick it in the fridge to hold leftovers...because I always need it in a couple days. This is the one. Get it!

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

Wall-E.  It looked cute in the previews, so we bought it sight unseen.  One of these days, I'll learn NOT to do that.  Starship Troopers 2 should've been the capper, but sometimes I have to learn the hard way.  Wall-E is enigmatic. He is diligent. He is curious. He is easy to love.  My problem with this film is that the story elements are very deep and heavy for smaller children, but moreover, they were wholly awful to watch if you have even half a heart.  I have to say that I failed to derive much enjoyment at all from this film, and what I did, was killed by the horror of the "message." People [Americans] too fat to WALK, living aboard a robot-run ship while a single Wall-E unit attempts to clean up the messy planet mankind has left behind.  No mention is made of other countries or their populous, but the accents of those aboard the Axiom [a proposition considered to be self-evident] were purely American.  And in the end, [SPOILERS] when people return to Earth, it's to the same filth-ridden earth they left 700 years prior, with the same problems, and with a total lack of knowledge of how to survive.  OH, and they're too FAT to WALK.  Lest we forget. [/SPOILERS]I was appalled with this "work," and genuinely hope that, from now on, Pixar goes back to the CHILDREN'S MOVIE venue, and leaves the aggressive fire and brimstone environmentalist crap to Greenpeace and Earth First.

I was very excited to see this production only to be dissapointed by the bad choice of camera angles and too much "Shakey Cam".  I have yet to get pass the first three episodes.  I undrestand the effect they were going for, use of a steady cam to simulate actually "being there" but to use it when a couple is lying in bed having a conversation is ridiculous.  I found it annoying to watch.  The crooked camera angles are reminiscent of the old 60's Batman series.  I found it very distracting from the story being told that I just had to turn it off.

All reviews for wireless products seem to run the gamut from great to terrible. I would like to provide my input, but your experience may differ.I purchased 3 of these in a row (over a week period). The first one I got working for a bout 2 weeks, then it started to drop the signal, causing me to have to power cycle the unit. I called Tech Support, and after about 30 minutes of troubleshooting, the tech support person said the unit must be faulty and that I should return it. I did so, and the second unit would not connect to the internet, and after another 30 minutes on the phone with tech support, the tech support person said the unit must be faulty and that I should return it. Having seen so many rave reviews of this product I assumed I was just having a run of bad luck and got another one of these. I had the exact same experience.I returned the Linksys unit and purchased a D-Link D-634M, and it worked within minutes of being out of the box. I have had no issues for the last 2 months.Not sure if the store I was going to had a bad batch or what.

This new office release is seriously flawed. Despite weekly "critical" upgrades from Microsoft, most applications still crash constantly.  As an example, one of my excel sheets crashes every time I want to update  a chart with new data.  Also Macros programming has been disabled.Beware of this version. I'm sure it will get better with the constant upgrades, but at this stage it is still flawed, even for the basic stuff.

The HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions lack the "110 minutes of 'behind the scene' footege" + a documentary entitled "Planet Earth -- The Future". Full descriptions of these from amazon's websites are as follows:"DVD Features:110 minutes of behind the scenes footage - one 10-minute behind the scenes program for each episode (SD release only)Documentary:Planet Earth - The Future: This 3-part, 2 1/2 hour series looks at what the future may hold for endangered animals, habitats and -- ultimately -- ourselves. Following the environmental issues raised by Planet Earth, it asks why so many species are threatened and how they can be protected in future. (SD release only)"My friend bought the DVD set as a gift, and we started to watch this extraordinarily exceptional documentary series. Among all other things, the part that we most liked was those "behind the scene footages" because there are some utterly and literally unbelievable scenes captured that make you wonder how they were captured, and after each episode these footages tell you about the techniques used for videotaping. As a frequent documentary watcher, I was really puzzled with how these series were videotaped, and the footages shed light to many things.Since I liked this series very much, I went to BestBuy and quarelled with a sales associate for the exhange of this DVD set with the Blu-ray one. Eventually I win, but when I came to my apartment, ultimately she won, because the footages were missing in the Blu-ray edition!!!BBC, first and foremost, what made you think that Blu-ray player owners do not require or less require the bonus feautres??Second, if you ever had to consider whether DVD player owners or Blu-ray player owners less need the bonus feautres, then how come you voted against the latter?? After all the bonus feautres constantly praise how you videotaped in HD!!As to the narrators, I have not watched the series on TV, nevertheless I share the same opinion with others, as a non-American.Why are you compelling these guys to watch the series in British English. I could respec`t your decision if you had sticked to British English for the TV broadcasting. But broadcasting with a U.S. narrator and then releasing the DVD with a Brit narrator is simply deceiving people.Anyhow, for the prospective buyers I will, irrespective of the HD quality, recommend the DVD set instead of Blu-ray. Believe me, the DVD series was also very nice. Not to mention that another reviewer comments that the visual quality on this Blu-ray is far worse than the then TV broadcasting. He relies his facts on the encoding. I don't know whether he is true or not, but it is better to consider his comments as well.

This is a great, compact, easy to use external drive for your backup needs.  Small, quiet, looks like a flask sitting on the table and, in my case, is 250GB of backup space for my Mac.The drive comes pre-formatted for Mac use (PC users will have to re-format and instructions are included for that) and right out of the box it shows up on the Mac desktop ready to use via either Firewire or USB connections.For optimal ease of backups for Mac users, I highly recommend using this product in association with your backups.http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.htmlSuperDuper is a great interface for your backup needs and can be used as a free download for initial use so you can try it out for yourself.  For best use, buy the license ($28) and you will get all of the full benefits of this great product that will make your Iomega drive that much better and easier to use.Iomega did a great job with this product and I'm very glad I bought it for my Mac backup needs.

LaCie mkes a great product, but packaged with poor software, minimal instructions and hardware/software that ultimately did not work was a killer for this product. I was looking for an external hard drive that I could keep at home and access over the internet. I have an Apple Airport Extreme and an iMAC of which the "Ethernet Disk Mini Home Edition" was connected to the Extreme via GB Ethernet. So far so good. After the software failed to recognize the existence of the newly installed hard drive for about 3 attempts, it all of a sudden recognized it. Yeah, great, now let's get this thing running.The skimpy instructions comprised about 10% of what I had to dig up on the internet to even get close to getting this thing to work. After a couple of hours, opening up several ports, and entering a bunch of poorly documented parameters into LaCie's host site, it finally, sort of worked.Every time I got into the LaCie Home Drive with my MacBook Pro, I would have to log in. Not a problem. Very slow data transfers, but it did actually limp along with the iMAC in sleep mode. The problem started with the inconvenience of having to log in from my local iMAC to access the local LaCie Home drive. Not just once, but for each and every folder on the drive. Nuts! Again there was extremely slow data transfer rates.Next I decided to change some of the security setups, like a different password. Fine, except the lame software again failed to recognize the existence of the hard drive. Forevermore the drive couldn't be seen by their own software. Then after too many futile attempts to get their software to work, the iMAC eventually couldn't log into the hard drive.Keep in mind, that everything in the initial setup was painfully slow too. Each individual parameter gets written to the drive one parameter at a time. First comes the password - and it takes 10 minutes? Next parameter - and it takes another 10 minutes? Come on guys. Hello! It's right over here! Setup took about 7 to 8 hours - full of frustration as you could imagine.The answer to remote data access by several computers of the MAC variety is to open a ".MAC" account. .MAC is fast, well behaved, packed with tons of features that are simple to set up and use, and it's convenient. If you love your MAC and Leopard, you will love setting up .MAC (about 15 minutes for the pair of MAC's) and using it's rich features.The other LaCie hard drives are fast and reliable and have always been a favorite of mine, but this one is rendered into a dumb brick by extremely poor and incomplete software, questionable hardware, and a frustratingly difficult user interface when it decides to limp along on its terms.I may have gotten a lemon, but there are too many things going on here and should be a warning for consumers to look elsewhere.

This review is from: Getting Things Done: The Art Of Stress-Free Productivity (Audio CD)
      

We all have too much to do, but most of us could be completing much more if we learned to stop worrying so much about not getting things done. David Allen makes the point that we have all these tasks ("unfinished loops") in our mind that keep us from attacking and completing our work with clarity. We need to identify all of our tasks (yes, every single one), and make sure they are cared for in some way (discarded, scheduled for later, immediately addressed, etc.) by our "system" so we are not burdened by them and can concentrate on the task at hand.Adhering to the "system" that David recommends requires discipline. Those not used to planning will shudder at some of the suggestions, but there is no doubt that if implemented and executed properly, productivity improvement will result. I personally favor Covey's First Things First time management approach which I believe achieves the same freeing effect, while ensuring focus is placed on the most important tasks. However, both methods have many similarities and following either would be beneficial.-- Nick McCormick, Author Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager

The rope is not actually a rope, it's a plastic mimic of a rope and my dog can't seem to figure out that he can tug at it like he can his tug rope.

I really enjoyed Twilight and New Moon.  Eclipse moved along kind of slowly, but I still enjoyed it.  I thought it was quite well-written.  I liked the suspense of the main danger (the vampires).  The love-triangle thing never really worked for me, but even worse, I never truly figured out the incredible unfounded hostility between the wolves and the Cullens.  It's not like the wolves were raised hating the vampires - it was something completely new to them, so the deep-seated hatred didn't really work for me.  I was especially disppointed by the ending - I wanted more.  However, now that I know that she is writing at least another book, I'm okay with the ending.  (I didn't know that when I finished the book).  All in all, I enjoyed the book, and I am excited for Book 4.

This is a very wonderful and enjoyable movie.  We actually saw it in the theater and then again at church when our church played it for our married class.  The acting is okay.  Considering their budget and the amateurs they used, it is pretty good.  The story, though, is very good and very engaging.  The messages it bring through for marriages and loving each other are marvelous.  It is a must see for all newly married couples as well as longer married couples.

I absolutely LOVED the first three books, but Breaking Dawn kind of ruined it for me. I was used to the fact that Bella and Edward were in love, but it went to a sickeningly sweet pinnacle in this book. I seriously had to skim through a few chapters just to get through it. I am well aware this book is targeted towards teens, but as a young adult myself (22yrs) I was very unsatisfied with Bella's character development. I felt she was very selfish and self centered. (spoiler alert!!)   She got everything she wanted and then some. She got Edward as well as keeping Jacob in her life despite the fact that it caused him pain (before he imprinted). She got immortality, she got to keep Charlie in her new life as well as a daughter she didn't even know she wanted. And when Jacob imprinted on Bella's daughter, I was totally lost. I will admit I was all for Team Jacob eventhough I knew he didn't have a chance. I felt Jacob was a strong character who deserved to imprint on someone his own age who would offer everything Bella couldn't without the constant reminder of rejection (eventhough apparently when you imprint, past loves lost mean nothing). I think Meyer is a great author and should definately continue writing in this genre, especially since we lost Anne Rice to more religious topics. But she should keep in mind that unexpected plot twists don't always equal a good book.

Firstly, this is not a hi end camcorder....and people shouldn't expect it to be.  What this is is a good, low-priced, easy to use point and shoot recorder that doesn't require much in the way of technical skills.  I've used this for several months now and I'm quite content with it.  The zoom really doesn't work great because of the resolution but thats ok with me.  The quality of the standard recording setting does a decent job of capturing the "on-the-fly" things.  While this would probably not be the camera I'd take on vacation with me, its a great device to drop into a handbag or backpack for more impromptu things.I've had no problems with connectivity to my pc.  Pop out the arm and it connects fine.  The software is pretty basic...nothing fancy at all.  But it works! It was a good purchase for me.

This is a replacement for a red Chi that lasted about two years with my 17 year old daughter. My 20 year old got a pink Chi at the same time. They both bit the dust at almost exactly two years from date of receit. I have the old ugly black salon style, this one, that is on its third year. For the first year, we were all three using it, yet it's still going. I don't know if the "pretty ones" have different specs or construction, but I'm opting for a standard, salon style replacement to see if it makes a difference. I am caucasian. My hair is naturally wavy changing to naturally fuzzy and frizzy with any humidity. I use good products, applied after washing and rinsing out conditioner while hair is still wet such as Biosilk's Silk Therapy and Aquage's Beyond Shine, both applied liberally. I blow dry,which makes it very fuzzy and frizzy, then spray on more Beyond Shine liberally, working it through the hair, yet avoiding too much on roots, which makes my hair shine like crazy. I then use the Chi. It gives us straight, silky, shiny hair when used properly. Do quick runs down separated hair strands about 2 or 3 times. Don't linger too long or damage can occur. Use it minimally to straighten, it is extremely hot. I can not emphasize that enough. Be careful not to let it touch your ear or other skin. It will burn you quickly and can scar.NEVER use the Chi on damp or wet hair! It will steam cook your hair. I had a salon stylist in a hurry do that to me on my damp hair,and I'm still trying to grow out the damage 6 months later (much of it has just broken off.) My hair was fried and didn't even look like caucasian hair. It has taken many expensive conditioning heat cap treatments to even look normal again. Use it wisely and carefully and you will love it.

Yes the price was a little expensive at first glance, but in the end it was worth it. A must for racing games! I searched many racing seats before I decided to buy this one and I'm happy with Evo seat. I use the Logitech G25 wheel and the whole setup is awesome. The contruction of the seat is durable enough for my standards and I fit nicely in it (i'm 5'10" 175lbs). It's contructed with a strong metal and is sturdy. The chair also fits most adults and middle-aged children(get the slider kit for the seat because it makes easier to get in and out of; sold separately.). Since I have the G25 wheel I needed the sold-separatley shiftermount also. Putting it together was relatively easy, but did require actually looking at the instructions! My only issues is that the slider kit should be standard (not sold-separately) and included in the package deal. Also, it would nice if the design could include a mount for flight games. It's a great looking cockpit for either a racer or pilot! This a great seat!

Folks, I read tons of reviews before buying Seagate FreeAgent Desk 1 TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive. The price/performance ratio seemed just right. For the money I paid ($140), this device seemed to deliver the most bang for my bucks (in terms of customer satisfaction).Initially, I was quite elated at the performance of the drive. But the drive started to make a loud clicking noise a few days after I had put the hard drive into operation and transferred some of my most precious information to this drive. This hard drive seems destined to fail and I'm getting ready to return it and try something else.I'm beginning to realize that it's probably a big mistake to rely on customers' reviews to buy single external hard drives at this juncture, since regardless of the make or model a large number of these hard drives continue to go bad.  Some poeple have incredibly great experiences; while others don't find themselves very lucky. It's probably a good idea to buy them in pairs and make two copies of all our precious data. That way, we wouldn't find ourselves up**** creek and without a paddle after transfering a great deal of data into one of these drives and then loose them all in a heartbeat when the drives fail.I think it's worth buying hard drives that allow the buyers to daisy-chain them into external stacks. That seems a very convenient way of having duplicate copies of valuable data.

I recieved this as a Christmas present from my husband. The FIRST time we tried it, it wouldn't work! My husband who is a born engineeer tried everything to get it to work; checked the dials, the plug, the plates and finally after playing with the cord got it to work- once. It was great when it worked but the second time we tried we experianced the same problem, only this time we could not get it to work at all! Needless to say we are returning it and doubt we will re-purchase it. I can't help but assume that if we got one that worked it will probably have a short life if used frequently. I was extremely disappointed. I desperately wanted this and getting a new in box unused defective griddler was such a bummer! (Although it was very sweet of my hubby to purchase this for me!)

In a extremely popular genre, few stand above the rest and "Let the Right One In" is absoluetly one of them. Tomas Alfredson's carefully controlled, yet sympathetic take on John Ajvide Lindqvist's Swedish bestseller is a masterpiece. A refreshing bloodsucker story that's rich with originality and feeling, a terrific love story and vampire tome that not only rewards the genre's fans but rekindles interest in its virtually exhausted foundation. At the same time, its characters are ironically more relatable than audiences have seen in quite a long time, thanks to a script that humanizes their problems. The fact that the protagonist is a 12-year-old boy obviously changes the dynamic of the story, but it's really the tender romance between him and Eli that gives the film its emotional resonance. Oskar, a transparent Swedish youth who is bullied at school. One day, a girl named Eli moves in next door. Soon, Oskar and Eli develop a tenuous romance, even as she is forced to decide whether she will stay with him or retreat from view where she can continue feeding without attracting attention from the authorities. Through his friendship with Eli, Oskar doesn't just learn how to defend himself, but to become a sort of predator himself, begging the question as to whether Eli really exists or whether she represents a manifestation of his pent-up anger and resentment.Naturally, the international success of Lindqvist's fifth feature, like Norway's chilling Insomnia before it, has inspired an American remake, which is sure to boast superior special effects, but can't possibly capture the delicate balance he strikes here between the tender and the terrible. And such performances from two special innocent young actors.

One of the worst childrens' movies I have seen. My three-year-old daughter and I went to the theater to watch it because at the time, there was not other kid movie out and we ended up leaving early because neither of us found the movie at all entertaining. The 45 minutes we where there seemed like hours--I was in agony. The jokes are old and overdone and rely on really obvious sterotypes that weren't ever funny. "Hold your tacos!" It's predictable.My daughter, who loves Wall-E and Kung Fu Panda, even Once, did not like this at all...it was hell to sit through. Hell!

I've had nothing but problems with this thing.  At least 1 a day, more often 2-3, it goes down and I have to pull out the plug, count to 15, retry it, and repeat until I get a connection again.  I called the representatives at Linksys to try and solve the problem and I got no help except, "well it does that.  You'll have to reset it each time."  Seriously, if I wanted that kind of hassle, I'd have stuck with dial-up and not bothered trying to go wireless.

They are constantly dropping connection and I have to unplug the hub and plug it back in to get the devices that are plugged into it to be recognized again.  I've used these hubs on XP, XP 64-bit, and Vista and they drop connections on all.  These are all different brands of computers and in two different physical locations so I know it's not my computer.

I received this as a Christmas gift last month. I really liked it a lot. I didn't feel the need for something very expensive or complicated, and this really fit the bill. It had a good sound, and was easy to navigate. After maxing out the song capacity @ almost 400 songs, it suddenly stopped working last night. It will now only turn on & off, with the message "finalizing update" on the screen forever. This is very upsetting to me, as I was very careful with it, keeping it in the plastic case & in a ziploc bag in my purse. Also, now that I think of it, I started having a little trouble with it turning on & off a couple of weeks ago. Sometimes, I would have to push the on button 2x for it to come on. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone, because it wasn't even worth the $20 my husband spent on it. I am very disappointed in this MP3 player. Now I have to save up for another one, when I was hoping this one would last me a while.

I bought this as a Black Friday special to replace a Linksys Wireless B router. I didn't need to but it was cheap so I did.Pros: -Setup was very simple; much easier than the Linksys router. The CD walks any user through the process, regardless of that individual's IT expierience. -The signal is very strong; I can connect to this router with full strength from anywhere within my apartment (approximatley 800 sq. feet).Cons:-Singal constantly drops or locks up. I am often surfing and my laptop will disconnect; when I try to reconnect I am unable to do so. The router has to be restarted and for those of you who have done it you know it is a time-consuming process. The router, cable modem, and both computers have to be restarting. Takes all of 10 minutes. To me it just wasn't worth it. I am using my linksys router again and will probably do so until I NEED to replace it. When that happens, I will most likely go with another Linksys product as Linksys has never given me an issue.

While not the best design, the Petmate Fresh Flow Cat Fountain functions fairly well. The pump is also surprisingly quiet, even when it's partially clogged. Initially my cat liked it a lot, but over time it became nearly impossible to clean thoroughly, which did not make the cat happy. Several times I resorted to soaking it in a bleach solution, which was all I could do to make the cat use it again. The tight spaces with severe angles made it difficult at best to get a sponge in. Using the dishwasher didn't help much either. After a year I replaced the unit with a Hagen Catit Drinking Fountain which seems to be much easier to clean.Pros: - Quite pump - Charcoal filter system- Water ramp (which my cat loves) Cons: - Filter is after the pump making it easily clogged by fur - Must be cleaned weekly, if not more - Reservoir can not be quickly filled, and impossible to clean- Hard to throughly clean by hand or in the dishwasher- Potential for bacteria buildup.

I've used Final Draft for Macintosh since Version 5. It's always been a touch cranky but well worth the trouble. This is no longer the case with version 7.0 (and the upgrade to 7.0.0.33 seems to have made things worse). Cursor position is unstable, that is you probably aren't entering text where you think you are. Randomly, selected text refuses to unselect. Parentheticals won't allow you to move the cursor to the next block of dialog. Smart type &quot;forgets&quot; character names and locations, et cetera. As is, this program is unusable and repeated e-mails to the publisher have gone unanswered.I hope they fix the problems, until they do I've gone back to version 6, and I'm out the cost of the upgrade.

I bought the Samsung NC-10 for my wife and the Eee PC 1000HA for myself so I'll compare:Summary: you can't go wrong with either one.PROS: I like the fact that the Asus keyboard is tilted towards you, makes typing more comfortable.  Also the power cord on the Asus has an elbow plug, which makes it more space-efficient and comfortable.  I like that the screen hinge on the Asus is stiffer, the Samsung  feels like it's going to fly open or slam shut.  Touchpad is less sensitive than the Samsung (good thing), Samsung gets a lot of accidental dragging of items.CONS: The Samsung has better style and a better battery.  Also the keyboard is bigger and feels like it's better quality.  Also the international warranty and more international name recognition is important for me.  Obviously it wins for bluetooth also although you definitely pay for it.  Less smudgy than the Asus.Remember that the Asus mouse buttons are designed to be clicked in front, not on top.Bottom line, they're both great.  We'll see how the next generation turns out.

My girlfriend and I have a spare DVD player that we were using before we moved as well as an LCD monitor. We wanted to hook both of them up in the bed room so that we could watch some DVDs. This product worked great for about three days (though it did over saturate the color a bit) and then it would start to flicker a little bit... then a lot... then it would loose color and only be in black and white. Then about two days later it went back to color for a few hours before it started flickering again. I returned this product and I'm going to try a different one (hasn't arrived yet)

I had the same straightener for about 4 years, and I loved it.  Since purchasing a new one from Amazon, I have not been impressed.  The quality is not near as good as my first one- in which I do not know why if they are the same.  The ends don't completely meet on one end and I think this is where the problem is.  Not sure if its the supplyer or just a bad one, but I am not impressed and regret the online purchase.  I should have gone to store to avoid this mishap.  But I do love the CHI straighteners.

Small as advertised.  Can be confusing on which way to insert when being put in a USB drive (unlike most thumb drives, it will go into a drive either "right side up" or the opposite).  Not a big deal if you use only one or two computers, but computer manufacturers do not install their drives in only one direction across the brands.  The drive did come with a small rubber plastic case which would have been a great carry option if it wasn't pink...?The primary reason I am writing this review is that I inserted the drive into a work computer today and "nada".  Same thing here at home.  Drive has stayed in my wallet, not run through a washer, etc.  Obviously unsatisfactory for a thumb drive (even generics are noteworthy for their reliability).  Perhaps, this is atypical for this manufacturer-or not-, but less than one month of light use rates the one star I am giving it.

This product does not displace the cat's desire to drink out of the kitchen faucet.  The unit makes enough noise to be distracting in a quiet room (not a "fountain" noise, but rather a "motor" noise.)  We used a large pyrex measuring cup to fill the fountain . . . the cat was more interested in drinking the remaining water out of the pyrex cup afterwards.  Clever idea, but I'd recommend against it.

This is my first HD camcorder. I spent months researching and debating the merits of minDV versus AVC-HD. I decided to go with tape due to the ease of editing, easy storage, low price of the tapes, and compatibility with iMovie '09. I have not been disappointed. After a few weeks of experimenting it is easy to master all of the controls. Many have commented on the flimsy feeling of the housing for the cassette. While it's true that the outer shell of the tape deck moves a little it will hardly be noticed after a few days of use. The outer shell really just serves a protective function and is not directly attached to the tape unit itself. Also, when you have your hand around it through the strap you can grap the main part of the camera with your fingertips  essentially holding the tape deck tight. It's not a problem at all (although I don't know why they couldn't just make it feel a little sturdier). A couple of points. I bought the DM-50 mic. I'm a wannabe "prosumer" and maybe that's why I can't tell the difference but I don't think the mic has really enhanced my videos much, not for $150 anyway. A lot of people have complained about the clicking of the function and menu buttons. This can be a problem. The function button makes a loud click when your press it in the center to open the menu. It is possible to be gentle with the side to side and up/down clicks. This is one case where the DM-50 accessory mic has helped. I find that if I'm careful, I can change settings while recording (mic level, exposure) without the mic picking up the noise. The buzz of the tape itself is essentially completely eliminated. Overall, very very quiet. I mention this because this was a key concern I had. I have a Sony DVD camcorder and the noise from the DVD spinning and recording is unbearable. I didn't want to spend money on an HD recorder and experience the same thing. It's hard to hit the menu button with my thumb while holding the camcorder. That's not too much of a problem because you can't use the menu function while recording anyway. The view finder does not adjust as mentioned in other reviews. I never use the view finder anyway so it's not a problem for me.  The life of the included battery is not long so buy another one. Also, unlike a Canon rebel camera, it does not come with an external charger for the battery. Those can be quite expensive, even on Amazon. If you are a beginner like me an want to transfer video immediately you have to buy a firewire cable. I didn't have one and was so eager to upload video I had to go to best buy and drop over $30 on a 6 pin firewire cable. Save yourself some frustration and money and buy one off Amazon for half the price at the same time you buy your camera. The widest angle setting is not that wide. I'm going to buy the canon wide-angle lens soon. I think this is probably the case for any camcorder. So, for someone who just entered the HDV market I am extremely pleased with this purchase. It is easy  to use with my mac and iMovie. I think it feels sturdy. It is pretty daggon quiet. And the picture is just unbelievable. The media is perfect for me. I got what I wanted.

I've used this trimmer a few times and it pulls a lot. I have an old Connair el cheapo and it does the trick without pulling - the only concern is that I can smell burning when I use it which is why I got another one. I'll stick to scissors for now until I find a trimmer that works properly.I had this product for about eight months before it died on me. When it was working it was quite painful to use, often pulling and tearing away the nose hairs. The light was absolutely pointless. It was better than the Connair I had prior to it whose motor you could smell burning as you used it. I can't believe how few choices there are for trimming nose hair and how useless they are.

I've purhcased several different brands of pedometers, but Omron is the most accurate by far.  I also purchased a couple dozen of them for some of the employees I work with to help encourage them to be more active.  Everyone loves them and many have asked where I bought them so they could purchase one for their spouse or friend.  Even others within the company have asked for order info as they had purchased pedometers that were worthless and want a quality one. They're great - don't waste your time on other brands!

Two years ago, like many users here I jumped over from Quicken on the PC to Quicken Mac... hoping that it would work as well. My wife and I loved the Mac but struggled with Quicken each week to reconcile our very simple checking and savings accounts from our credit union. We hoped that we would just get better at living with its quirks or that its quirks would get ironed out in updates. Neither ended up happening. I wouldn't say that we do ANY kind of advanced accounting at all. Very simple, straightforward downloading/matching of transactions, trying to monitor a budget, etc. I cannot imagine how we made it through nearly 2 years of using Quicken for Mac without going completely crazy!We finally had enough when Quicken started LOSING transactions that were downloaded from our bank. One moment my paycheck would be there and downloaded, then we'd go look for it in the register... GONE. WTF?!? How does a program like this LOSE a transaction. It happened 3 times and that was it. I searched for new Mac finance software and thank goodness we found MoneyDance. I'd looked at it several months ago but it didn't really look all that great. But after actually buying it and using it we're totally hooked! It is SO much better than Quicken in SO many ways it's hard to address everything here. First there's the matching of transactions. To be honest, my real favorite finance software on the PC was Microsoft Money which imported online banking transactions more accurately with fewer false-matches than Quicken PC ever did. Still, it's hard to imagine ANY program that is more inept at guessing transaction matches than Quicken Mac. That's the first big problem.MoneyDance excels at transaction matching. All fields auto-complete as if psychic. If you need to change something, it's very simple and intuitive and it remembers that change for the next time that type of transaction comes up. Advantage: MoneyDanceSecond, there is no easy way to sort transactions by cleared/uncleared in Quicken. A completely ridiculous oversight. All I want to do is download my online transactions and update my own record comparing it to what the bank shows... then see a total of cleared vs. uncleared. In Quicken, uncleared transactions can only be viewed by running some complicated, customized report. Why not a simple column sorting capability? This is a no-brainer and MoneyDance allows sorting by any column - date, check number, payee, amount, CLEARED transactions. Advantage: MoneyDance. In fact, MoneyDance has a drop-down display with four $ amounts for your checkbook register: ledger (your true checkbook balance), cleared (what has cleared from the bank), bank's balance (what your bank actually showed as balance), and current balance (accounting for anything that is pending on the next business day). It works so well that we don't even have to 'balance' our accounts monthly any more. Our accounts are balanced each and every day when we download new transactions. We're able to verify easily all outstanding checks by simply sorting the register by what is cleared - which is so far ahead of Quicken it's just insane. To see your bank's balance in Quicken you have to go back into the Download transactions window.Third, budgeting features on Quicken are hopelessly complex to setup. This shouldn't be so amazingly difficult. It's addition and subtraction. In MoneyDance you just setup your categories, make a new budget and add the items/amounts in the list. MoneyDance even has a bar graph at the top of your account view that shows where your budget income/expenses level is currently.Fourth, overall software layout and interface. Quicken looks pretty at first until you start trying to use it. Any toolbar button you push opens another little window. Great if you have a huge monitor where you can spread all of them out but really useless on normal screens. MoneyDance mostly consolodates functions into one changing window. Advantage: MoneyDance.Fifth, transaction searching. Hello Intuit, this is a Mac. It has something called 'Spotlight' search that's been around for several years now. MoneyDance has a spotlight-type search built right into the top of the register. Looking for a specific transaction? Just try typing it in the search bar and the as-you-type list populates with matching results. Crazy-easy. Advantage: MoneyDance.So my recommendation is to take a look at MoneyDance and steer clear of Quicken Mac. No amount of refinement on the PC side has made it over to the Mac version. You will hate this program. It will cause you problems! Stay away!!!

I have the WRT 54g v8.  Router.  Every so often, it drops the connection.  It becomes useless until you reboot it.  I was surfing yesterday, using my Pocket PC.  Everything was fine.  I tried a couple of hours later and I got the message Invalid Key.  I went to my wired computer and I could not get online.  I used the Easylink advisor and it showed that it could not find the SSID or the key or anything.  So I had to reboot.  This has happened twice so far.  I did not spend as much time trouble shooting this time because I had seen it before.  It looks like it will stay up for about a week before I have to reboot.  I can live with it but I expected better.

The main problem witht this book is that she spends too much time on Bella's lameness. This book is seriously lacking the energy that books need to keep reader's reading, and despite the stuff with Jacob, it just doesn't grip at all. However, despite my bad review of Eclipse, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are both 5times as good as this. So despite the fact that this book could be a struggle, the rest of the series makes it worth reading.=) KEEP READING!

The FURminator does not work well on cats who do not like to be brushed.  The fur needs to be removed from the brush constantly and every time I stopped to do this my cat ran away.  The FURminator did remove more fur than a regular brush so you will not have to brush your cat as often, however, with the amount of time and effort I had to put in I do not think this brush is worth the price.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      

I was very disappointed with this film. Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book "Poor Fellow My Country" (and hi earlier "Capricornia"), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than  portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of "Poor Fellow My Country" was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.So, watch "Australia" for the scenery, for the cinematography, for some false nostalgia, a spot of romance, and some feel-good stuff, but don't mistake it for any kind of reality, past or present.

Just received the Vado HD.Pros:Small camcorders in theory are fun and allow you to take video where you normally would not - big kudos to the convenience factor.Buttons are well placed.Large memory size - but in reality you don't need it because when using these cameras you take small clips and then download.  But if you do record all on one shot this may be a bigger pro for you.Actual videos are nice for such a small camera on the TV but not as nice as the HD TV picture quality you may be used to.Battery life seems very good and you can replace them when they eventually die out.Cons:Video can be very shaky if you are not ever so careful - so they lack of image stabilization is a problem if you are careful.Optical zoom is lacking and using the digital zoom is a huge mistake as the picture becomes very pixelated.Low lighting situations are very pixelated/grainyThe USB jack located on the bottom is a poor location especially for placing this on something flat so it can record.BIGGEST complaint is the software and MAC issues.  You can get it to work but you must download additional codecs and such and convert - just ugly and not very easy. I finally did figure it out with the help of a savvy computer geek and then the additional conversion seem to take an even bigger hit on the video quality. It was jerky on playback - and this was on the latest brand new mac. The software interface and ease of sending to videos to family via email - it was just not a click and go camcorder like I had hoped given all of the conversion steps.  I will be returning this  and probably buy into the MinoHD cult which I know is easy to use and has equally good video quality or maybe the Kodiak Zi6 which has come down significantly in price.

Hopefully buying a copy from Amazon works better than trying TurboTax's new direct sales authorization procedure. The authorization code delivered over their phone link has not worked for more than one Mac user, even with the Mac 10.4xx OS that is REQUIRED by the 2007 TT version. If you have a lower version of OS 10.x, forget TT for your needs.

I wrote this to help out others who bought it.  As soon as you run the install disk, the program crashes (cannot get onto internet) so the install disk appears worthless.  Don't give up, look for an icon that says the manual.  It is almost hidden.  Open the document and print it on a color (highly recommended) printer.  Guess what, they didn't provide a manual on paper and the electronic manual is behind an obscure button.Basically, you can talk to the box using internet explorer without an internet connection.  But you need to know the address.  So you have to go into DOS, and ping it.  It will return an address.Then you go into your internet explorer and type that address (something like 168.169.200.55) and you are in the menu of the box.  Then you tell the box what type of internet connection you have (POPeP, POPxx, xxxx, xxx etc (I forgot)), supply your password and user name if you provider requires it,  Then it should work as a wired router.  So how do you know if Verizon is using POPep or another internet connection?  You have to call support.Wireless is easy if you don't use passwords.   Of course, that is dangerous.  I suggest you first get the connection to work reliably without passwords before worrying about it.I recommend passwords.  More pitfalls.  If you use password, it provides you with 2 levels of encryption.  Use the simplier smaller one because your wireless PC card cannot handle the complex one.  Then it ask you for a key phrase, supply something - this is not your password.  Then 4 keys are generated on four lines.  Write down the key for the first line -- this is your password even though it is not named as such.  I haven't tried the other lines, maybe they are passwords also.On your wireless card, when you log on, it ask you for a password, supply what I said in the last paragraph.If you get fustrated, shut everything down and power up in the sequence suggest in the manual.  Some of the software/hardware changes requires a reboot -- even though the software didn't ask you to.Is this complicated enough?  I have 2 doctor degrees, make my living as something like a technical writer, built my own computer from chips, can program in C, Fortran, Pascal, machine language, and I still couldn't figure it out.  I don't have network experience.  You may need to call support and have someone guide you through - like I did.  Make sure you buy from a place with a liberal refund policy.

This is an ultra-portable laptop with Linux and wireless Internet access.* Can mount Windows SMB shares.* Plays DivX, MP3 and YouTube videos. The Firefox already had a MPlayer plugin.* You can install and run RealPlayer for Linux on it if you want. There are web sites that show you how to add Windows audio and video codecs so you can play WMV or other Windows format audio/video files.* Mine already had Java 5.0.* The location of the Right shift key needs some getting used to. Keys are quite small and I can't keep typing on it for an excessively long time. * Was able to login to using my Skype account and make VoIP calls right out of the box. There are green and pink jacks for the headphones and mic.* Dictionary was set to Chinese language by default but you can set it display English.* The E-book reader is able to display Plucker format e-books from Project Gutenberg.* It displays PDFs using Adobe Acrobat Reader and the displayed text is quite readable especially in Full Screen mode.* Setting up wireless internet connection was very easy. * You can plug in a USB stick and it gets automounted. A "Flash disk" window automatically comes up with the contents of the drive.* The E-Book icon gets lost after you do a Software Update but there are web sites that show you how to put it back.* Ctrl-Alt-T launches an xterm. Running konqueror gives you a bunch of useful utilities.* GNU Emacs and MIT scheme both are not installed but they can be installed if you need them and they do run well on it. Read about adding Xandros repositories and pinning repositories first before attempting to install software using apt-get.Check out the unofficial EeeUser wiki site for photos and a lot of useful info.* It is possible to NFS mount shared filesystems. Just add nfs entries to /etc/fstab and they'll be mounted when the wifi interface comes up. You'll probably want to unmount them manually though before shutting down the eeepc: sudo umount -t nfs -a.

If you are in the market for an external sata drive, this is the one to get. I have been buying external HDDs for 5 years now and know a good one when I see it.Pros:- Lay down design. (Very sturdy. I don't think I'll be knocking it over any time soon.)- Supports esata, firewire, and USB.- Surprisingly quiet. (Awesome. All of my other drives are pretty noisy.)- Does not come with any sluggish and useless programs that you are forced to use.- Very nice looking. (Most people don't even know its a hard drive until I tell them. It looks like a shiny black box. Very minimalistic, and very Apple (if that's your thing.)- Includes all necessary cables (except USB, which you will not be using if you bought the version with esata. The USB only version probably comes with a USB cable.)Cons:- In comparison to other external HDD manufacturers LaCie does not provide as good backkup software. (For most this is a non-issue.)Overall I am very impressed. I researched heavily for the perfect external drive and chose this one; I have no regrets. After 2 months it is still running smoothly and quietly, looks nice, and blends in very well with my dark wooded desk.

This is an outstanding, ingenious litter box !After trying the "automatic self-cleaning" (good for nothing) and returned litter boxes...I once again decided to try a new litter box. This one is great ! I ordered the largest size for my 2 cats. You simply roll the litter box (and it's not heavy) , then return it to the orginal position and the "clumps" are deposited in a nice tray , you simply pull out the tray and dipsose of the waste. There are no parts to wear out, no filters needed, no waste bags needed. It would get a 5 star rating if it had an auto-clean up on the litter the cats leave on the carpet after using the box. I don't know why I don't see these sold in stores.

As part of installing a network in the house with both wired and wireless machines, I contracted a local vendor to setup this wireless router.  After three failed attempts to make it work we switched to a competitors brand and had no problems.  In the wired mode the router was fine, but the wireless was a disaster.  Not only did the router not work, but the software that comes bundled with it crashed two XP computers on the network (leaving a Win 2000 system untouched -- go figure).  This router caused me several hours of headaches and the technicians even more.  If I could give it a zero, I would.

We purchased this for our three cats, set to dispense 3/4 of a cup 3 times a day.  After watching it dispense, we discovered it dispenses the wrong amount.  The 1/4 cup setting dispenses a little more than 1/4 cup, the 1/2 cup setting dispenses nearly 1 cup, and 3/4 cup setting dispenses over 1.5 cups.  It's possible that this is because our cat food is pellets that are pretty small, but either way - if you buy this, be sure to check to see how much it's *actually* dispensing!

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

I have both a PC and a Mac, so I rarely worry about virus protection. The PC is a necessity. The Mac is a godsend. So I bought OneCare for my PC not really thinking about what I'd need it to do. Someone else had recommended that I try AVGFree, which worked just as well. Well OneCare lived up to my expectations, which were low. You can put this program on up to 3 PCs for virus, adware/spyware, and firewall protection. The software is easy to use, with a color coded bar that tells you your computer's overall health (green = good, red = better go buy a new computer). I have Windows XP and had no connectivity issues. This program seemed to detect things well enough, with no annoying pop-ups, and I haven't really had any problems. I'm not much of a PC guru, but I'd recommend this product to a friend. It comes with 24-hour customer phone support, which in my opinion is worth the price in itself.

This grinder worked very well, for the year or so it worked.  The only complaint I would have is the static electricity imparted to the coffee, the device, or both, which made the process alittle messy.  That may simply be an affliction that all such devices have.  All this said, it seems to me that the clear plastic canister on the top, and particularly the integrated tabs that fit into the grinder itself, were flimsy.  That is how the machine got busted.  Past its warranty.  Given that the other reviewers, many of them, describe this as one of the hardiest of the grinders in its class, I am not sure about what to buy as a replacement,

I originally saw this item in a pet store, watched a video that was part of the display and watched with skeptisism at how much fur they were combing off the dogs.  I thought the price too was a bit too high.  Then  our groomer said she broke down and bought one and was amazed at how well the brush worked on our dogs.  I have a Husky and a Alaskan Malamute, one with long hair the other medium long hair.  After purchasing this from Amazon I gave it a try, wow, was I impressed.  Our husky has shorter hair but he has a lot of down undercoat which can get very thick and hard to brush out.  Within a short time I pulled out quite a bit of this unwanted down fur and he had no complaints and actually  enjoyed the brushing.  The brush also worked well on our long hair Malamute who has less down fur but still I was able to get quite a bit of loose hair off of him.  I must say I am very impressed with this product, it is a bit pricey but in our house the higher price is worth it.

My son wanted a video camera to film him and his friends skateboarding.  I saw this at another online store and bought it.  The High Definition quality promised by the name made it seem worth the $205 price.  Plus the small size seemed a plus.  Should have read the reviews here first.  As others have said, if you want to film people in motion, buy something else.  If you hold this camera in your hand, the picture jiggles as your hand moves.  But the capture speed is slow enough that any motion is jerky even if you put the camera on a tripod.  Filming a skateboarder doing a kick flip just did not work well with this camera.  It's not false advertising.  This is a fun camera, well designed.  If you freeze the frame, you see a pretty good picture, with good definition.  And the camera is very convenient for using with a laptop.  It charges from the laptop's USB port (that is actually a little inconvenient for us -- a normal charger would be easier).  Uploading pictures to the laptop is simple.  No problem there.  We need something different (and I'm sure more expensive and less convenient) for the skateboarding.  But we may keep this camera for fun.  It packs a lot into a small, easy-to-use package.  We won't really use it, I'm afraid, but it feels a little harsh to think about sending this clever gadget back.  Like sending a puppy back to the pound.  [Update -- I did return it.]

the war sequence was completely offensive...there is nothing funny about people getting shot and ripped to shreds in a war...even if the intent is to spoof other movies.  that left a bad taste in my mouth from the start and almost made me shut it off completely...it didnt matter because it was so unfunny and un entertaining that my wife and i fell asleep not even half through the movie.

Although the unit responded to "test" off the dog, did not work on the dog. Followed directions to properly tighten, but never responded despite several tries. Sent unit back within narrow time frame. Amazon responded promptly and satisfactorily.

My son has been sucking his thumb since he was in the womb (could see  him doing it on the ultrasound!).  Though it made him a great sleeper as a baby, now at 5 1/2 it was time to stop.  Now he's losing his first tooth, the dentist told him he should stop too. Fortunately, my son is very taste sensitive, so he really did not want to suck w/ the Mavala on. Unfortunately, the first night he woke up screaming at 2am because he sucked and we had to deal w/ the rinsing and wiping his tongue off w/ a towel!  He kicked his habit within 2 days, has not sucked in 4 weeks now! (BTW, we started putting a sock over his hand so he would not accidently suck at night time)

El router es muy bueno para lo que cuesta pero no se si sea solo a mi...pero a veces se me pierde la conexion (cuando no hay equipos conectados al router...conecto inalambricamente una laptop, un wii y por cable a una pc) o a veces de repente usando solo la laptop inalambrica y debo desconectarlo, conectar por cable el modem a la laptop, luego cuando agarra conexion, cambio el cable para que ahora vaya del modem al router, del router a la laptop y prendo el router y cuando agarra conexion ya todo funcuona normal...saludos!!

I have been using this product for about a month. It has performed as I had hoped. I use it for C&B and have had no problems. There is the issue of taking your time and patience, but apart from that no problems. The attachments seem to be okay for this purpose, too. Highly recommended.

The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks.  This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger. I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm.

As the title states, this movie has no soul or feeling.  I am a fan of the original series and went out and bought the DVD without seeing it in the theaters.  I went in it with no expectations and watched it with my wife (she wanted to watch it...I was happy watching Dexter Series 1 DVD).  We both hated it.  It was the worse movie we have seen this year.  Dancing Robots (Jazz)...WTF, All Spark (just call it Energon Cube), Sam instead of Spike, stupid sex stuff, dog peeing on one of the autobots, stupid one-liners, and the computer animation.  The list goes on...your life will be better if you do not see this film nor will you waste 2 hours of your life.

I regret not following the advice of the majority of reviewers on this one. These really are terrible sheets. I have the Graco Cubby Parade Pack N Play and figured the sheets would be good since they're manufactured by the same company. Boy was I wrong. They don't fit the pad very well regardless if it's laying flat for the playpen or if it's set up for the bassinet. Since the bassinet is 3/4 the pad folds up and the sheet doesn't stay put very well at all. They are also cheaply made. Thin isn't even the word. It's upsetting that my Babies r Us only carries this brand. I'm going to return the rest for a store credit and try to find a suitable replacement elsewhere. As for now I am currently using my bassinet w/o a sheet. The pad wipes down well and if i'm going to have my daughter in there for a long time I use a waterproof pad under her. Since she's always wrapped in a blanket she doesn't mind going w/o the sheet.

In a sturdy metal case that is typical of D-Link products the DUB-H7 7 port hub is a very sturdy, quality product.  It has green lights on the front of the hub to tell you that is is working properly, but unlike the cheap plastic hub it replaced, the lights are not too bright or intrusive.  Cables fit securely into the ports.  Of course the hub works flawlessly.

Is it worth paying for half a season of the best current science fiction television series? Only you, the customer, can answer this question. However, I suspect that many loyal fans of Ronald D. Moore's brilliant update of "Battlestar Galactica" will purchase this DVD set. Since I have not yet seen the episodes, I can't comment on them directly, but the second season contains a couple of fascinating plot twists and turns. First and foremost, does the Colonial fleet survive a potential civil war between the Galactica crew led by Commander William Adama (Edward James Olmos) and supporters of President Roslin (Mary McDonnell)? How does Adama recover from Lieutenant Boomer's (Grace Park) attempted assassination, and is Colonel Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan) truly fit to serve as the Galactica's acting Commander? Is the Boomer trapped on Caprica with  Lieutenant Karla "Starbuck" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) truly pregnant? And what contest of wills shall develop between Commander Adama and Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes) of the battlestar Pegasus? I have no doubt that Ronald D. Moore, his fellow writers and directors, and the cast of "Battlestar Galactica" have wrought yet another compelling half season of riveting science fiction drama which is light years ahead of anything I have seen since "Babylon 5".

Software is great, but added fees SUCK.  You pay $40-$45 for their friggin' software and then they want $18 each to file fed and state if you want to file your returns electronically.  Come on!  What is it all about if you're not going to file electronically!?  Oh, and if you owe the feds or state, they want 2.49% of the owed amount and you're using YOUR credit card to pay the owed taxes and they call it a "Convenience Fee."  TT has convenienced themselves out of a customer that they have had for the past 8-10 years.  Next year I will use a different software just because they are so greedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (VHS Tape)
      

We are studying the Civil War in my sophomore American History class, and everybody must read a book about the Civil War, so i took on the challenge of reading GWTW. Wow. What an amazing book. No other book can make you love and hate a character at the exact same time. It will be hard to enjoy other books when you compare them to GWTW. So, after reading it i just HAD to watch the movie. I couldn't even finish it. It left out a lot from the book, and you didn't get to know the characters as well. I do realize that it was made in the late thirties, and that it would take hours and a narrator to include everything in the book, but it was still a disappointment. But if you liked the movie, you MUST read the book. Don't be scared by the size! And the first four hundred pages worth of actionless descriptions are necessary in order to lay a good foundation for the greatest story ever told. &lt;- and that is an understatement!!! Please read this book! You will never be the same!

I wish I could give this junk 0 stars.  Why is this even in the religious section of this website?!  This blasphemous movie is an offense to all people of faith and to God himself.  It seems Bill Maher and those like him won't be happy until America is seduced into the giving away of all the beliefs and freedoms that have made her great.  They won't rest until the worshipers of God and their teachings are silenced and everyone believes in what Bill does.  Don't be fooled, Bill does indeed have a dogmatic, violent and absolute religion and it's called atheism (albeit with a halo of existentialism).  It seems Mr. Maher has decided to become a contributor to the destruction of our peacefuly coexistent society, pity.  As a libertarian, I do support Bill's right to say whatever he wants, as I will not hold a double standard. But I feel athiests will nevertheless always abuse their freedom in advancing their intolerant beleifs.  Tell me when atheism was a force for good in the world?  When has it produced anything more than the devaluation of human life and rights?  If there is no God, where do we even get our "rights" from?  We are all just monkeys in their eyes, worthless people with worthless dreams.  But we who believe in God know that we are not just people, we all count, and we do have rights and one of those is to worship our maker.  We are the intelligent ones, we can order our own lives well, and show a gentleness atheism can only briefly imitate.  Only a fool says in his heart, "There is no god." Bill Maher is a foolish, foolish man, and doesn't know what he's talking about.

This product has a big problem with overheating.  I solved it for a while by switching out the power supply for a lower voltage (I know, it surprised me that this worked too).  At any rate, it worked great for the first 90 days or so, but it's not a good long term investment.

Purchased one in the middle of February, 2009.  Worked great for about two weeks, then I went out of town for few days so I disconnected and unplugged it.  When I returned it was dead - will not power on.  I emailed WD to see what my options were - no answer.  Rather than lose the data I had stored I opened the case, removed the drive and installed it in my desktop machine - works great now as a 1TB second drive.  I didn't want to return it because I had backed up some personal data on the drive.  My advice is use it as a back up drive - but make sure you have copy of everything somewhere else.

The mechanical design is somehow flawed.  I expected the yoke to slide back and forward with ease and return to center when released.  The movement should be on ball bearings for the price of the product. Instead, the yoke return position (controlled by springs, I am guessing) stopped anywhere in a +/- 0.5 inch location. The simulators I use react to this movement and I am constantly correcting. Maybe I some how received a product that slipped through QC.  I am dissappointed.  I could design one better than the one I purchased and cannot recommend this product.

Overall, I am satisfied with this coffee maker.  For starters, the coffee it makes is delicious.  I have been using a French press for the last 5 years, and was weary about buying an auto-drip brewer, but I was not disappointed.  The first batch of coffee turned out rich and hot.  It is also aesthetically pleasing to look at.  I like the simplistic toggle controls and dials.  However, it is not very ergonomic.  The water bin is right up next to the filter.  It's hard to pour water into the bin without spilling it into the filter.  I have learned to pour it without splashing it, but there should be some sort of separator or conduit that assists in the pouring operation.  Also, the measurement indicators are inside the bin, and are impossible to read, so it's a good idea to measure the water before you pour it in.Instead of a glass carafe and a heating element, I wish it had a stainless steel carafe.  That way, I could just have it turn off right when I am done brewing and then keep the coffee warm for hours.   On this machine, if you want warm coffee, you have to keep the heating element on.

I have had one of these for about 3 years now.  I wish I had never bought it.  Condensation builds up inside the water compartment which also holds the covered grinder bin.  If you don't open the top after you finish the coffee, moisture builds up inside the grinder and the coffee begins to get wet as it is ground.  This ends up jamming the grate where the coffee is pushed into the filter.  I had another brand of grinder/brewer for years.  It had a separate compartment for grinding and for storing the water.  This one is a big hassle.  Lot's of cleaning/drying just to get it to work right.  We just grind the coffee in a separate grinder now to avoid the hassle of opening and wiping the grinder out all the time.  Cuisinart chose form over function for this machine and I am surprised that it is still on the market.  It has kept me from buying other Cuisinart machines.  My wife and I both dislike this machine very much.  It is too expensive to be so poorly designed.  I did not buy it to spend my time after making coffee cleaning out the steamy mess from the grinder.

I bought this unit since there seemed to be a fair amount of pod coffees available for it.  I bought about 6 different brands in addition to the Senseo brand to see which I liked the best, etc.  Wow, did I make a mistake.  Unless you want to stick exclusively with Senseo coffees, you should not get this unit.  Most of the other makes of coffee pods are the wrong diameter or too thick for the single-pod insert while being too thin for the double-pod insert.  And most of them can't be double-stacked in the double-pod holder.  Apparently this unit forms a pressure seal, so if the thickness or the diameter of the pod is off you won't get a decent cup of coffee, or the machine won't seal, or if it does it will only partially seal and you'll get a nice spray of hot water all over.  I'll probably throw this unit up for sale on an auction site once I've run through the coffee I have.  I will then switch to Keurig.  In its defense it does make a good cup of Senseo coffee, but I want more than 4 or 5 types of coffees to choose from.

Yeah, yeah, it's Transformers, what do you expect? I expect it not to suck!Whatever. The reason I purchased this film, yes I purchased it, was to show off my home theater. It's a reference disc, no doubt about that. The picture quality is outstanding, and so is the sound. Especially the SOUND!The story blew, the acting was godawful, and the whole Sector 7 bit was atrocious. This goes down as one of the worst movies of the year. Funny how this makes a ton of money, and great double feature films like Grindhouse make nothing.The film is long, and I would say only 30 solid minutes are devoted to the action-considering the film is almost 2 1/2 hours. I pretty much had my finger on the FF button.It's only in my collection, because it's a reference disc of the highest caliber.

My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago. My husband and I are vegan, so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes. (I eventually started compiling them in my blog, A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.) We've never had a problem with the machine. Every recipe I've invented has frozen nicely. I keep the bowl in the freezer all of the time, so I can make ice cream whenever I feel like it.I do wish that the plastic covering/shield thing was dishwasher-safe, because it can be a pain to clean, especially when I'm using a high-fat coconut milk. Still, it's not too difficult, and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)
      

This is one of the most enjoyable movies I can remember watching while growing up.  The only problem with it is the annoying cut scenes that feature Fred Savage being read the story.  Had Reiner simply provided the story as is, without the annoying backdrop of a sick kid being read the story in bed, it would have ben perfect.  It has everything you could want in a classic adventure.That being said, if you haven't been duped into buying this DVD yet, take my advice, and stay away. My rating reflects the DVD, and not the film, which I would give 5 stars.  Buy the Special Edition instead of this.  This DVD is the worst one I own.  The &quot;Special Features&quot; that are loaded on  this puppy include a trailer and...well that's it. The &quot;collectible booklet&quot; is the DVD insert that all DVDs have with the word &quot;collectible&quot; thrown in.  They could call the plastic wrap on it &quot;collectible&quot; too for all it's worth.  For a DVD to come out in 2000, especially for a film this good, and have jck for extras, is an atrocity.  They obviously rushed it out so they could sell the Special Edition later.However, my biggest problem with this DVD is that it IS NOT TRUE WIDESCREEN!  The only thing that makes it widescreen is that the picture is technically wider than it is high.  They did this by actually taking the full screen version, and chopping off the top and bottom, instead of showing it in the true 16:9 aspect ratio it was shot in.  People buy widescreen format to see the true film, since full screen cuts off part of the movie.  This is the reverse in this case.  If you watch the full screen version, you actually see considerably more of the film than the widescreen.  THAT is the reason to stay way from this horrible disc.  Although if you're REALLY cheap and only watch movies in Full Screen, go ahead and get this version.

simply the best film ever from start to finish it captures the imagination and despite its length you never want it too end. All the cast put in sterling peformances. Aside from all those classic scenes one of my very favourties is the scence between Hattie MacDaniel & Clark Gable after Bonnie is born particularly when they tease one another and mammie lifts her skirt to reveal the red petitcoat!A timeless classic and i like the fact that the film has a multi racial cast and resulted in Hattie getting a much deserved oscar. Vivien Leigh and Olivia De Havilland are among my most favourite actresses ( Bette Davis, Joan Crawford & Lana Turner included)buy it immediately everyhing right down to the theme music is perfect

I bought this because ConsumerSearch said that Seagate made the best-reviewed external HDs. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of working OK, I suddenly started getting "delayed write failure" and $Mft errors. Those are very bad signs. I had already saved over 50GB worth of data on there, representing 2 weeks of tedious work. After hours of troubleshooting, I noticed that my data was accessible for a few minutes right after restarting the unit, so I spent all night repeatedly restarting the unit by pulling the power cord out and reinserting it, copying as much data as I could before it failed on me again, repeat over and over again. What a nightmare. When the auto shutoff feature was acting buggy from the beginning, I should have been wary. I'm going back to Buffalo. I have a Buffalo HD that's worked perfectly for 3 yrs, despite my having dropped it on the ground and damaging the case.

For literally years I'd been waiting for the price on a "real" flash based camcorder to drop to an affordable level.  At one end you had traditional tape camcorders, which gave great results but it seemed every one I had would start malfunctioning in a few months, not to mention the trouble of copying off the tapes.  At the other end were the cheap "camcorders" who's best claim to fame was taking a moving picture.Finally I found the FS100; some people may sniff that it's "only" standard resolution and does not have optical stabilization, but I can live with that.  Mine is currently running with a 16GB SDHC card, that gives 3 1/2 hours of video.  For people who want even more, I say remember the 30 minute VHS-C tapes?  It's quiet, takes good quality videos, and pretty much gets the job done.  For the price it can't be beat, it even takes external microphones.  My complaints about it are minor, but I'll list them so people can see the FS100 in perspective:The joystick menu is a little awkward to get used to.The light is a bright blue/white LED.In dim situations video quality goes downhill fast--but then remember the price. The battery is removable but entirely internal, so forget about the "extended power" batteries available for most other camcorders.The last is probably the worst, it records in .MOD files without flagging the 16:9 wide screen format.  The .MOD files will play in media player (they're Mpegs in a different container after all) but all scrunched up.  If you use a free utility called SDcopy they are not only turned into Mpegs but with the correct wide screen ratio.You won't want to use the FS100 for making the next Hollywood movie.....although after watching the quality of recent flicks you probably could.  But this is a great little camera for family movies, vacation trips, and general shooting.

Bella is back to her normal clumsy, book-reading self in this third book in the Twilight series. She and Edward are planning for their future while the Cullens and the werewolves are preparing for an attack for several vampires. Jacob states his case to Bella, and all hell breaks out. Meyer certainly has a way of writing a Gothic style novel with teenage angst and romance and making it fresh and utterly enjoyable. I had a hard time putting this book down (we left the doctor's office with only 35 pages left to go, and I actually was upset that the appointment was over too early!) Edward is beautiful, cold, the moon. Jacob is earthy, warm, the sun. How is Bella supposed to choose between the two? (And how come this girl gets all the cute guys? If I were a teenage girl from Forks, I would be seriously peeved with her!) Less than a month until the release of Breaking Dawn, and I'm almost as anxious about it as my daughter. We'll have to fight for who gets to read it first!

Return to manufacturer was easy but replacement is on back order for 3 months now even though you can still buy it in stock off Salton's website.

I was even told at 2 months that it hasn't been that long (hinting I was complaining for nothing).My biggest mistake was not returning to amazon (I was at 30 day mark and called the manufacturer).1 star for poor manufacturer response.Update....by coincidence I received shipping confirmation the same day I typed the review.

This is pedometer is Consumer Reports #1 rated digital pedometer- and I can see why. It's extremely light weight and really easy to use with just four big buttons on the front. Here's a few of its best features:-it can accurately senses steps in your belt, pocket, OR purse!-it has a large display for the visually impaired-it has a 7 day history so you can see progress (or lack of)-it calculates calories and distance in addition to stepsI'd recommend this little device to anyone who wants to lose weight- just begin one day, and the next day, see if you can maintain or beat your previous step record. Now how easy is that? So what DIDN'T I like about it? Not much. Perhaps the ONLY sort of negative thing I can say is that you will need a tiny screwdriver to open the back of it to put in the battery. Other than that, if you're looking to increase your activity a little to improve your health, look no further. Also recommend The Sixty-Second Motivator for anyone who needs more motivation to stick with an exercise program.

I first saw this kettle at a friend's apartment, and was entirely wooed by the beautiful design.  As someone who drinks tea night and day, and is fussy about design and quality, I insisted on having it.  For the first few months I was ecstatic - great ease of use, stayed looking good, no stink like others have mentioned, and I loved the lighted meter - but then one morning it mysteriously died.  Totally dead.  No power outage, no problem with my surge protector, no fried circuts - just dead.  This is a pricey appliance from a good company but I had bad luck - what a bummer.

This software is significantly slower than Office 2004, despite that 2004 ran under Rosetta, and this one is Universal.  There are a number of bugs (try dragging a chart in Excel, it will likely disappear... was there in 2004 also).  Even after the first service pack/update, it is still garbage.  Entourage is still as bad as it was in 2004, if not worse.  Word is so slow, that an person of average typing speed can type a few sentences before it actually shows up on the screen (or an entire paragraph if you have Parallels running).  There are few new features, most of this is interface change.  They also removed macros, which won't affect the vast majority of users.  They should have added a Formula Review button/screen as they've had in Excel 2003 for PC (it may have existed earlier).  They should have also tested it to see how slow it would go (which maybe they did - make Office as painfully slow as possible to try to get Mac owners to buy PCs just to get fast Office).This "upgrade" follows the Vista pattern - Office 2004 was better.A better choice would be to buy Parallels, XP Pro, and Office 2003 or iWork, or something - anything - else.  Heck, even Office 2004 is better.

I LOVE THIS VIDEO RECORDER.  IT'S EASY TO USE, PRODUCES NICE CLEAR VIDEOS AND, WITH THE SOFTWARE BUILT-IN, IS EASY TO EDIT, EMAIL AND SAVE.  BUT, IT DID NOT ALWAYS START RIGHT UP AND, NOW, THE BATTERY WON'T TAKE A CHARGE.  AND BOY DO I HATE TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF SENDING IT BACK!!!  AND I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR 2 MONTHS AND ONLY GOT 4 VIDEOS USAGE OUT OF IT!! LOTS OF LUCK IF YOU BUY ONE.

The replacement litter cartridges for my Scoop Free Self-Cleaning Litter Box are easy to use and I have had no trouble with them leaking/spilling, etc. They are MUCH easier and less messy to deal with than changing the recepticle on my old LitterMaid! My husband, who won't have ANYTHING to do with the litter boxes generally, was even impressed at how easy these are to change. Unfortunately the litter cartridges are fairly expensive, and I have yet to find them in a local store so I have to plan ahead and order them from Amazon (free shipping is good, though). They also don't seem to last as long as advertised - I change mine about every 10-14 days (the box is used by only one of my two cats).A minor thing that bugs me about the cartridges is that they are too big to fit into my garbage can after they've been used, so I have to put them in a trash bag and set them next to the can on the curb on garbage day. Not a huge deal, just a minor annoyance.

When our coffemaker died of old age and overuse, my wife wanted a programmable coffeemaker. She drinks decaf; I drink high test. Her pot could be ready at 5:30, she could pour it in an insulated carafe and (God bless her) make my pot.Though it makes good coffee, I kind of hate this machine. I'd like to slap its designers.For years I have had a succession of wonderfully designed, inexpensive Braun Aromaster pots that make great coffee. This Cuisinart thing pales in comparison. When you open the top, condensate drips on the stove or countertop. The carafe, rather than having a hinged lid, has a hard-to-remove-and-reinstall snap-on job. The reservoir is really hard to pour water into, especially if your machine is under a vent hood or overhanging cabinet.What idiot designed this thing?When it dies, I'm going to be Braun again.

I loved the first 3 parts and could not go to bed before not having finished them. This book was the only one I read in 2 days - and I could have taken a break even more often. I agree with other reviews that the message this last book sends is wrong: marry with 18 and live happily with your perfect partner and your perfect child. The perfectness of the main characters was increasingly getting on my nerves. After hearing it a 1000 times I knew how beautiful Edward was - no need to mention it 1001 times. In the other books this Bella-adoring-Edward and vice versa-thing seemed not as bad as Bella had her (human) flaws. What no one has mentioned by now: Wasn't Bella getting on your nerves by feeling guilty for everything that went wrong in her surroundings? She is constantly feeling responsible and sorry even though sometimes there is no need for her to be.  Well, with one exception: The only time Bella could and should have been really sorry, she isn't: when she endangers her life (and thus Edward's life) by continuing her pregnancy. By her knowing the story of the immortal children and her not-knowing what exactly was growing in her body she also endangered her new beloved family. Weird: she felt horrible and excused herself 100times when she cut her finger, Jasper attacked her, and she thought she caused the family problems. Ok, I admit one might say, the love for her baby is so strong that she does not care that her Edward is almost dying due to grief, that the Cullens are separated into a pro- and anti-baby faction, etc. But then again: wasn't Edward the biggest love of her life? After the baby comes into the story, Edward's character seems to disappear. All in all, I was very disappointed of the plot and the characters. DB ruined the saga for me.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

To begin, a little description of setting, just to give context.  I'm an eighteen year old college fresh(wo)man who was looking for a few good reads for winter break.  That being said, understand that although I'm a year or two older than the target audience of the Twilight series, I'm other wise who the author is writing to.  Like "Twilight," "New Moon" is about the now eighteen year old Isabelle "Bella" Swan and her vampire love, Edward Cullen.  However, when he mysterious leaves her - claiming to no longer be in love with her - she finds herself lost and flailing.  Fortunately, she finds support through Jacob "Jake" Black, a Native American werewolf a year or two younger than her.  Together, Bella overcomes her loss and deals with a new threat around  her.  One of the things that bothered me about "Twilight" was how Bella seemed to have no hobbies or past time interests.  Which is why the relationship she develops with Jacob in "New Moon" was really satisfying.  In contrast to Bella's relationship with Edward, her friendship with Jacob seems to have serious substance.  They have shared interests, fears and friends.  In contrast, Bella's "friends" from school are vapid and meaningless figures.On a related note, "New Moon" is certainly more involving than "Twilight" - there's more drama than "Oh-no-I-love-a-vampire."  It's more like "Oh-no-my-vampire-love-has- abandoned-me-and-now-I-might-love-a-werewolf-but-vampires-are-trying-to-kill-me-crud."  You can see the added dynamic.  Another sort of petty thing that bothered me was Stephenie Meyer's use of adjectives in reference to Edward.  He was always described as "perfect" or "beautiful" - physical traits.  Never was he described using emotional adjectives, like "gentle" or "loving."  To me, these physical adjectives trivialized the quality (and intensity) of Edward and Bella' relationship.  I mean, (since it's from Bella's perspective) it seems clear that she only "loves" Edward for his physical features.I know about of fans like this series because they can place themselves in as Bella and pretend that the story is happening to them.  I'm not sure how any one can do this, or really want to do this.  Bella is a hugely dependant and unstable character.  She's weak emotionally and occasionally whiny.  But still, some how, I'm drawn to her personality.  Maybe it's just because I wonder what stupid thing she'll do next...Which, I suppose, blends into another problem I had with "New Moon" - and the entire series in general (though I have not yet read Eclipse).  Bella's personality is severely lacking.  She lives for and through Edward - so when he leaves her, she is nothing.  Eventually, he returns, but does she learn her lesson?  No.  She continues to be as dependant as possible.  As a feminist, I'm a little ashamed of myself for liking these books.  Bella represents the typical "damsel in distress" who relies only on the male figures in her life for support and survival.  "New Moon" is like a guilty pleasure.  It's full of fluffy drama and angsty-ness.  Admittedly, this appealed to me better three years ago, but it is fun none the less.  Will Bella and Edward end up together?  Will Edward save the day?  Will the Cullens return?  We all know the answer, but it's still fun to find out.Oh, and enjoy the not-so-subtle "Romeo and Juliet" parallels before they get old and tiresome.  Which they do.  Quick.

I upgraded from a Linksys firewall and Apple Airport to this unit and was delighted with the great price, wireless range, and configurable features (although there is no way to log attempted intrusions).   But once I fired up iChat and tried to video chat I was defeated by this router, which simply refuses to let video or audio chat work, and Netgear even acknowledge there is a problem with this at their support pages.   This had worked perfectly through the Linksys.   Then, as I worked further with the router, I discovered that the wireless connection is spotty - dropping maybe twice an hour for a few seconds at a time.   Again, this seems to be something many compain of.Overall, it seems wonderful, but has ultimately let me down.   I am looking for a new router.

I had a $10 Vidal Sassoon Clipper which was plain painful to use, used to tangle my hair, wasn't sharp enough, used to make a mess and would take forever to cut hair. This Wahl is everything that Vidal Sassoon wasn't. I bought this after much research and almost to point of resigning myself to getting my hair cut by a stylist.In short, the cutting surface is sharp and powerful, like the ones used in salons (I used to wonder how is it that the stylists clippers cut so effortlessly compared to mine) and in my case just 1 pass of this clipper was enough to cut it to the level I want. What used to take 1 hour to cut now takes only about 10 minutes, and I was able to do it on my own! It has many attachments and extras which may or may not useful but the clipper itself is a gem -- powerful and painless.

We didn't start watching BSG until recently, because we didn't want to get involved in another series. But this is completely worth it! Often, in a sci-fi series you can pigeon-hole characters as "the smart scientist", "the well-meaning but dim strong-guy", or "the token female." That is not the case here. The characters pull you in with well-developed personalities, flaws and all. Throughout the series, they continue to evolve and respond to the changing situations. Even the Cylons are more deeply human than many characters in other series, and ultimately, that's what makes this series so engaging.

Three hours into it and I stopped being able to think clearly.  Using this with Windows is likely the culprit, along with the ridiculous setup instructions included in the box.   Online support at apple.com equally unhelpful.  I'm giving it another try tomorrow, with S.Monroe's instructions (above) here on Amazon.  I observed an Airport Express being installed from an iMac over the holidays and figured "I can do that."  Au contraire:  While it may ultimately work, it's been fruitless effort so far trying to install it with Windows.

Battlestar Galactica?  My goodness, what a horrible name for a TV show!  If my co-worker hadn't assured me it was worth watching I never would have given it a chance.  I had never heard of the original show (wasn't even born yet) and there are a lot of sci-fi series out there that I can't stand (Star Gate, Firefly, Voyager).  On the other hand I do love drama and shows with emotional depth and complex story lines.  Before BSG came into my life I would have said my favorite show of all time was HBO's Six Feet Under.  BSG has all the drama, depth, character development, and intelligent writing that Six Feet Under had but on top of all that you get some amazing special effect and battles in space!  I've also always been partial to stories concerning the end of the world and the self destructive nature of mankind (I was particularly fond of Stephen King's The Stand).  Battlestar Galactica takes all my favorite genres and premises and swirls them together to make one amazing show that is part sci-fi, part political thriller, and part spiritual fantasy.  If you're just looking for another Star Trek: The Next Generation you may be in the wrong place.  If, however, you loved Star Trek: Deep Space Nine then BSG will take you to a whole new level.You can't go wrong with Season One.  Every single episode is worthy of multiple viewings.  The weakest episode is either "Water" or "Tigh Me Up, Tigh Me Down" but in all honesty they still carry their weight.If you like BSG then I would also highly recommend the soundtrack.  The music of the show is beautiful and integral.  At first it may just seem like a bunch of percussion but as you make your way towards the finale of this season you should really start to notice some of the excellent musical themes.Also, be careful when purchasing.  I made the same mistake so many others made.  This set INCLUDES the MINISERIES.  Luckily I realized my error and was able to cancel my miniseries order before it shipped.  Season 4.0 also includes Razor so don't go buying that separately either.

The Linksys turned up without a hitch and everything is functioning as it should.  Kudos to the support team at Cisco.  I would recommend this product very highly.

I love this coffee maker! It is so fast and easy to use. There is also a huge variety of k-cups to choose from. I have noticed you get more k-cups and cheaper prices if you buy them from Amazon. Yeah this coffee maker is more expensive then a drip coffee maker but you will save in the long run by not throwing out coffee, plus you will always have a hot fresh cup of coffee! I wish this model had a water filter built in but I use the Pur faucet water filter and that works great, alot cheaper then using bottled water and you get the same results. Go ahead and get one, you will be happy.

Yes, like many others when I first bought this version of Quicken I had just crossed over from windows to mac.  I had some difficulty adjusting to the different interface, and a few quirks when transferring my account data over, but now that I've been using it exclusively for about 5 months it is just great.  If you're switching from PC to Mac, just think of this as a different product and don't expect the exact same features.  I find this one actually easier now that I've used it. I was just used to where everything was in the windows world since I had been using that for so long.Here are the things that I think can be improved on the Mac version:+ there's no way to sort the account register by amount. You can only sort by date and the check number field.  I like to sort by amount sometimes so I can find a specific dollar amount (minor irritation)+ the reporting feature is a bit cumbersome.  If you're like me, you'll want to just click the buttons and get your report created without having to read the documentation.  I managed to get what I needed without the help screens, but it was still a bit of work.  Thinking back, I had this same problem with the Windows version, so this is not a Mac vs Windows issue - it's an overall Quicken issue.+ I was really annoyed with the way it connected to my online banking accounts when I first started using this version.  I think it can still be improved like the Windows version.  With the Windows version, one click from inside Quicken and it's connecting to my bank and downloading the latest transactions for all my accounts.  With the Mac version I have to login to my bank then download each account's activity file.  Now that I'm used to it, it is less irritating to me, but it still would be nice to have that one click feature back.  What I do like about the Mac version:It works.  It does what I want it to do and it does it well.  I don't need to keep a Windows computer around just to do my banking.  When I switched to Mac, I switched to Mac - it's all or nothing for me.  I don't do a lot of finance work with Quicken, never did.  I just keep track of my checking, savings and credit cards.  I know there are a lot more features should I ever need them.  But I like simple, quick and easy.  Quicken 2007 for the Mac works for me.

We couldn't decide if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or serious.  It may have been one of, if not THE, worst movie of 2008!  The only reason for one star is Hugh Jackman, who even in a corny thing like this can come across as someone watchable.  And what is with Nicole Kidman and those pumped up lips - it seemd to affect her performance.People, don't bother with this movie!

My Maltese has been taking this product for almost three months.  She had dark brown stains covering her entire face from eyes down.  She is 13 lbs, and I have been giving her a scant teaspoon every day.  After a few days of treatment I noticed that her eyes were very watery, but with clear tears.  Excess watering stopped after another couple of days and she has had no more staining since that time.  New hair is growing in white and she looks like her beautiful self again.  Powder is a little messy, but she eats it readily when mixed with a little wet food. I highly recommend this product.

I got this ice cream maker for Christmas, and since I've been making at least one batch a day, for me and my husband. We both simply love it! I read some of the slightly negative reviews from people saying that the ice cream maker doesn't freeze all the ice cream, or that the edges of the freezing bowl are frozen while the middle is liquid....well, I think this is normal, as long as the machine moves, you won't get a totally hard frozen ice cream from it. Once the 20-30 min cycle is done, I take the mixture out of the bowl and move it to a freezer for another 30 min or so, and eat it then. By that time the consistency is perfect, and the ice cream won't get hard, and still tastes great...smooth and yummy :) the only negative (but this goes for all home made ice creams) that the longer you store it in a feezer the more ice crystals (the harded) it will get, so the best is to eat the whole batch the same day...which btw isn't a problem at all...home-made ice cream is simply delicious!

I have a brand new iMac with an AirPort Extreme card installed.  I finally got around to purchasing this wireless router to go with it.  I have been using the non-wireless 614 router with no problems and figured moving to the wireless version of the same product would be a piece of cake.  Well, it wasn't exactly plug-and-play.First off, I'm a software engineer.  Tinkered with the hardware side a bit as well.  Have been Unix sys admin before.  I'm no dummy.  As a _wired_ router, I've had no problems with this unit.  Wireless, on the other hand, hasn't been so great.  I would say that, very reliably, my wireless iMac can detect the presence of the router.  But trying to connect to it hasn't worked very well.  Once I enabled the AirPort card in the iMac, I was able to detect other wireless transceivers in the building and surf the net on their ISP's.  (There's one called 'linksys' that's always worked.)  I could also detect my own NETGEAR router, but the connection would fail.  Usually.  This is the second time (I've only had it 24 hrs but have played with it almost constantly) that I've made a connection with my router.  I've done all kinds of resets and playing with configs, moving the components into different rooms, and honestly, nothing happened between my last failure to connect and now.  I mean, it is capable of working, but my neighbors' wireless routers have been more reliable than the one I bought for myself.1.5 stars.

This review is from: Howard the Duck (VHS Tape)
      

what everyone seems to forget is that &quot;howard the duck&quot; was a comic book made by marvel in the late 70s. this wasn't some cutesy harvey comics deal. it wasn't dark, but it wasn't a part of the regular marvel universe --- per se. actually, howard did make his first appearance in a man-thing comic (&quot;adventure into fear&quot;?) and would eventually wind up in a &quot;marvel team-up&quot; (#95?) with good old spider-man. so what i'm trying to say is that george lucas had no idea what he was doing (where was dr. bong?), and that's why the movie sucked. in the comics, beverly is a voluptuous redhead, and okay, lea thomson is hot, but she was totally wrong for the role.speaking of roles, everyone mentions jeffrey jones and tim robbins, but no one mentions thomas dolby as the bartender.the same thing happened with &quot;teenage mutant ninja turtles&quot;, the filmmakers totally made them 'cute', and those films stunk as well, but at least they made money. why they made money, i'll never know... nor would i want to. the comics were dark, and once the first movie came out, i sold the comics. didn't want to be associated with that crowd (and the comics weren't that great anyway).bottom line: i'm still waiting for the forbush man movie. you know it. oh wait, that was &quot;blankman&quot;, wasn't it?

We needed a new toaster so thought we would give this toaster/breakfast sandwich maker a try. It did take us few times to get the consistency of the egg correct.  I then marked the line on the water cup so I can make a sandwich without trying to read the cup everytime I use it.  The sandwich comes out perfectly.  Very tasty, english muffin, egg and ham are all done at the same time.  Makes breakfast preparation easy..This product was a great choice for us.

I was almost put off by the price of this unit, but I took the plunge and bought it and I'm glad I did. It makes perfect coffe every time, and has the flexibility to produce exactly the cup of coffee you want at any given time. Those who say the coffee is too weak don't understand how to use the machine [see my recommendations below] and those who say it's too noisy haven't placed it properly. The pump does make a bit of sound but if you isolate the unit from hard surfaces, with underpadding for example, the noise is tamed considerably.About the strength of the coffee: It helps to understand that the K-cups themselves are portioned for a standard 6-oz coffee cup. Most people do not actually use 6-oz cups and have never made a standard measure cup of coffee. I hadn't either until I got this machine. Now I understand. If you use a 12-oz cup, you need 2 K-cups and two shots of water at 6 ounces each. Not cheap, but sure is good. You can adjust strength for taste by adjusting the amount of water. One of my sisters likes it a little weaker than standard, so she uses a single 10-oz shot of water. Comes out perfect for her. My son likes it strong, so he uses bold K-cups, one with a 6-oz shot and one with an 8-oz shot of water to make his morning coffee. I like mine kind of medium, so I use two regular K-cups (not bold), one full-caf with 6 oz and one decaf with 6 oz and I'm all set. Great coffee. You can make it any way you want from standard coffee cup to travel mug. Don't try to make a full travel mug with one K-cup unless you like it weak. One friend of mine likes it that way, though, so there really is a recipe for everyone.Let's face it, K-cups are not cheap coffee for home brew, though it is more than competitive with barista-served boutique coffee and every bit as good. But for those who can't get past the price of the K-cups, there's is a very clever little contraption, easy to use, that lets you use whatever coffee in whatever portion you like! What could be more flexible? Even with the little contraption, making coffee with this machine is much easier and tidier than using any kind of coffee pot, and the results are fantastic.I agree with the spring water recommendation unless you are lucky to live in a place where the water is additive free with no taste of its own. I buy store brand spring water by the case. It's worth it for the quality of the final product. If you care about good coffee, go the extra distance. If you use the little brew contraption that lets you use your own coffee, then the little extra cost for spring water, which you should be using anyway, isn't really a burden. If you pony up for this appliance, you probably don't care all that much about the price of coffee per cup. Besides, if you buy coffee out, this is less expensive even with two K-cups per serving and spring water. All that doesn't come to $1.39, so there's really nothing to complain about.This is not to say the machine is perfect in every way. Probably no machine is perfect in every way. It could be quieter. The reservoir could be larger. The control panel could have more buttons and adjustments, although I don't see how that really would be an improvement. You can adjust the water temp and the shot size, so what else do you really need? Get it, brew up some fine coffee and enjoy. It's quick and easy and very neat and clean.

IYCC uses this router at its factory in Laredo, Texas, and has installed it for clients. We usually install a version of DD-WRT ([...]), and are enthusiatically happy about the results. We have one in our warehouse, where the daytime temperature is often well over 104 fahrenheit (40 celcius) degrees, and we run it overclocked. Despite the punishment, the router runs without failure day in and day out. It has been known for several years now that the Linksys WRT54G series of routers, running the Linux operating system, performs better than commercial-grade routers, with lower energy consumption and better features. Most, if not all, models of Linksys WRT54 routers can run Linux without any problems, but this particular model (the WRT54GL) is allegedly engineered with components that run best with Linux. The hardware inside is no different in kind from the hardware on other models, and is even a bit lighter on RAM and flash memory than some. Our only conclusion is that Linux is so much more efficient that it just doesn't need more hardware to do the same work. Less hardware means less heat stress, so one would expect more stability and reliability. Perhaps that's why it runs so well in our warehouse. You may be asking why you should pay an extra ten to twenty dollars when the other models of the WRT54 will run Linux too. I can only answer for myself: I'd rather spend twenty more bucks and be assured it will "just work". Our engineering time is worth more than $20 if there's a problem, so I just pay the freight. I also have to admit that I feel better about paying for a product that is engineered for the most advanced operating system on the planet than working with a half-baked, crippled, proprietary OS.Loye YoungIsaac & Young Computer CompanyLaredo, Texashttp://www.iycc.net

I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year. It's easy to use, makes great ice cream, and the design is simple, so there aren't many complicated mechanical things going on that are in danger of screwing up. It was a great price, and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of. If you want to control the fat/carb/preservative/etc. content, you can do that (but why would you WANT to?!?).Be prepared to make space in your freezer for the bowl and for your collection of home made ice cream. Within a day or two of buying this, I had about 5 or 6 different flavors in the freezer.Pros- easy to use, easy to clean, simple design, great priceCons- freezer bowl can hog limited freezer space

this was the hairstyling iron my 17 yr old daughter had to have. it worked fine for six months then quit working. buyers beware as the farouk/chi company will not honor their one year warranty for internet products. on the warranty card in the box they clearly state that products bought on the internet are not warrantied. this discalimer is not stated on the amazon web page. even on an iron with a warranty farouk chi charges 15.00 for the repair.  after many back and forth emails amazon replaced the hairstyling iron themselves, so hats off to amazon for doing the right thing.

I ordered "full." The labels on both top and bottom sheets say "full." But when I put them on the bed, they were much too large. I measured them. I checked the dimensions in the product description. They are really "queen" size.They seemed all right quality-wise. If they fit, I'd keep them, although I suspect the hemstitching will prove to be a rip waiting to happen.

This pedometer's functions were awesome....while they lasted. Unfortunately the beltclip wasn't as well made and within 5 days of using the pedometer, it fell off my pants and was lost forever.

It feels to me like this was just a bunch of ideas of HOW to end the series shoved into one long, not very entertaining book.  I found myself very bored throughout most of the book.  There was no great conflict, no great adventure, and no great love like the previous books had.  I know not all books need a message, but I adored the first three books and the message of love & sacrifice.  I cried for Bella's sacrifice at the end of Eclipse and for Jacob's too. In the end, he did let go of Bella even though he loved her with his entire being. It was so beautifully sad and romantic. I really connected to the characters and felt their pain.  In this book, I didn't feel a thing.  I found myself irritated and bored almost the entire time.  If it had been any other book, I would have stopped reading, but I wanted to this book to be good so badly that I kept on going until the very end.This review is pretty pitiful, I know, but really - I'm just speechless at how BAD this book was.  There are some really well written reviews on here that articulate the issues so much better than I have.  I just had to add my poorly worded two cents to the collection.Boo, Stephenie.  Next time, don't let your editors & fans rush you to finish something until you & your characters are ready.

This review is from: The Wizard of Oz (Three-Disc Collector's Edition) (DVD)
      

Warner Bros. released The Wizard Of Oz - Three Disc Collector's Edition on October 25th, 2005. For many Oz fans, this was a long time coming. The long awaited Special Edition to one of cinema's most cherished films. The DVD presents the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen. Keep in mind that this movie was filmed in 1939 so no widescreen version exists. In 1955 MGM re-released the film to theaters but in a cropped 1.85:1 widescreen. Basically all that was done for this release is placing black bars on the top and bottom to make it fill the theaters movie screen. So in reality, a authentic widescreen version doesn't exist. The audio & video for this release is stunning as Warner took the time to clean up the picture and make the sound crisp. As for special features, Warner has included over 10 hours of impressive features. If you're a fan of Oz then I would say this is a definite buy for you.

This software is not worth the money you pay for it.  It has a ridiculous and time consuming installation process which doesn't work on some systems and they do not bother to tell you this in advance.  The company is unreliable and difficult to communicate with.  They have now twice promised me update CDs to correct the problems with their software which have not arrived (the first time they promised me was about 8 months ago and the last being over 2 months ago.)  Not all the features that are supposed to come with this software actually work. There are other programs for screenwriters out there.  Save yourself the money, the time and the headache - try a different one.

I wanted to love this product.  I've been through two of them already, and they have both died on me within days of my having received them.  In both cases, the same problem occurred:  The battery refuses to charge.  Plug it into a USB port, a powered USB hub, or anything else, and I get the same result.  The thing just won't accept any juice, will not mount on either a Mac or a PC, and is otherwise useless.Tried contacting tech support at Flip/Pure Digital--good luck to you if you ever have a problem.  They have no phone support, just automated email responses, in which they give you the same instructions already available in the user manual, or on their web site.I'm sending both of mine back to Amazon for a refund.  I guess I'm going to look around for another pocket camcorder.

These sheets are lovely.  That they were $39/full is better yet.  I had purchased "hotel quality" sheets from Bed, Bath, and Beyond and they are ok... but they were $99.  The eggshell color is rich yet understated.  These are truly a bargain... Enjoy yours as I am enjoying mine.  As for other comments that suggest the sheets feel like cardboard, that was NOT my experience, however, I did need to remove the cardboard from the packaging!?!?!

I bought ACT 2009 based on an exec's past experience with an old old version of ACT. We'll see how the venerable franchise has held up over the years.During installation, a "Prereq" program that runs in the background throws 2 exceptions, so right off the bat, I think the installation is possibly corrupted.I let the installation finalize, I launch the program, even with a fresh install, the software takes a long time to launch. This does not bode well for future performance at all.Ok then, I trudge through this to see if there's anything redeeming.  obviously the first order of business is to create a new database: I tried to do it but got an error "Unable to create the database. There is an error connecting to the Microsoft SQL Server".At this point, I think I would just return the software and look for some other alternative. I am sure there's other companies that have more experience in creating software that's not so buggy.

This review is from: Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) (DVD)
      

That's right, you heard me!  I hate this movie!  I used to give it two stars, or maybe even three, but over time it just got worse to me.One of the many misunderstandings about this film is that it is a kids' movie....when I was a little kid, I found it quite scary, depressing, and even disturbing (the scene where the boy turns into a donkey still sends shivers up my spine).However. . . . . . Jiminy Cricket should've won an Oscar!  He is the true heart and soul of the film.  He is very, very funny!!! Some might say that Pinocchio is the best.  But he comes off as an idiotic little brat/punk.  And supporting Oscar to Cleo the cat!  He's awesome!  I hate the goldfish, however!All those who say this is one of Disney's best:  BAH HUMBUG!

The scroll wheel concept is difficult if you're not used to it. Some menus you use the buttons, some you use the wheel. Some features are hidden, like when a song plays and you hit the center button: who knew? It's certainly not in the worthless 37 page PDF manual, nor is how exactly to pop in the micro SD cards; they have to be flush, not hanging out or they're not really loaded. Found that out by luck; almost called Support. A non-typical USB cord? Who are they? iRiver? Everyone else can get by with the standard USB cable, from mp3 players to GPS devices; not Sansa!The lack of documentation is irritating. First thing you have to do is charge the player and meanwhile download the updater and the manual. Great!Otherwise, I like the heavy feel, the screen is bright, the controls work OK once you're familiar with them, and the micro SD expansion slot is a great feature. You could buy the 8GB model, get a 16GB SD card and have more storage than an older PC! as well as 99% of the other mp3 players on the market.I can't comment on the video capability since I haven't used it, and the FM tuner is nice.Seems like the volume is a bit weak; have to go up to about 50% of max before it gets very loud. And of course, the earbuds suck. I got a nicer pair than these for free when I bought some Schick dispo razors. Come on, guys! Is a decent $5 pair of earphones too much? Guess so.Good, expandable player for the money. Some dealers have a problem keeping them in stock, like hh Gregg! Paid $59 on sale (when they finally got one in.)

I saw all of the good reviews and decided to take a chance on the Lacie.  I needed something that worked with "Time Machine."  It worked nicely, if somewhat noisily for less than a year.

I used this juicer for the first time this morning, and initially was really excited about it.  It seemed to work well, and was quick!  After I used it, I immediately cleaned and rinsed the parts and washed everything in the dishwasher.  Maybe 3-4 hours later I took everything out of the dishwasher to make a new batch of juice.  I found that all along the seams of the mesh filter basket little pieces of carrot had collected.  So I tried cleaning the seams again with the brush that comes with it, I tried soaking it, I tried soaking it in a lemon juice solution as suggested by the owners manual, I tried vinegar, and regular soap and water.  I finally even tried a toothbrush, but there was still carrot stuck in the seams of the filter.This seems to be a very serious design flaw, as this could easily make someone sick.  I can just imagine how bad this would get over the course of a few months or years.  Needless to say, I did not use the juicer again, and unfortunately had to abandon my juice fast that I started today.  I was extremely disappointed!As the manufacturer is not open today, I was unable to reach them.  But I am hoping at the very least that they have a replacement filter without the seams.  If they do not, I plan to return this immediately.

This little netbook is amazing!  My original thought was to upgrade it to 2GB of RAM, and I may still do it, but it hasn't proven necessary; this running Office and stock analysis software.  Even if the person in front of me on the plane has their seat back down, it's comfy to use.  Touch typing is no problem.

Anyone interested in buying this mouse definitely should there are more than enough customizable buttons you can program, and the instant dpi button makes things easy for whatever game you may use this for.  I like a big fat mouse that fits nicely into the hand, this mouse sure take the cake, the buttons are slick so cleaning is a snap and it just works very well.

I had nothing but trouble with the Netgear wireless PCI card (NETGEAR WG311 Wireless-G PCI Adapter) that came with my XP PC.  It kept locking up my PC at the worst possible times, and nothing I tried, even with the help of Netgear's tech support, was able to eliminate the problem.  An attempted Trendnet replacement (Trendnet TEW423PI 54Mbps 802.11g Wireless PCI) was worse; I couldn't even get any driver to load.  In contrast, this MSI Turbo mode wireless PCI card has worked like a charm and with its little separate antenna gets a much better signal from my wireless router.  This is an inexpensive wireless PCI card that is compatible with my XP PC system and that instantly resolved my PC's locking-up problem.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)
      

Got it for my son as an early Christmas gift. When we put it in the DVD player the words came up "Transformers_Vanilla". I could guess what this meant and wasn't happy. My son was looking forward to watching some "special features" or "behind the scenes" footage that typically come with a DVD. But there was none. It appears that this version doesn't come with that. You have to pay extra and buy the "Special two-disk version". He is very disappointed and I am very angry with Amazon that there was no warning on their web page. Not that I would have been happy about paying more for some footage that normally comes on a DVD....I also understand that manufacturers are doing this more often these days. It doesn't make it right...

I'll quickly go through a list of why this show is not good for a casual, or even hard-core sci-fi fan.1. camera angles.  The cameraman is in a constant seizure while taking every shot.  Some call it edgy or dedication, I call it crap.  During spacebattles they zoom in and out, IN and out, IIN and out, then you barf and ships explode offscreen and then the battle's over.2. Plot.  If you wanted Lord of the Rings of Sci-fis, this is definitely not it.  There's enough holes in the script, I'm suprised the actors can read it.  Every episode, the writers just pull something out of their butt and say: we've planned this since the beginning, to impregnate a robot.  wtf?3. Mood.  If you love Colonel O'Neill on Stargate SG-1 and all his funny quips...go watch SG1, because this dialogue is devoid of comedy.  People say: It's supposed to be dramatic and serious.  That's bull.  Anyone who's been in a real life stressful situation ESPECIALLY WAR (ask your grandparents) tell jokes out of nervousness and desperation all the time.  Personally, these colonials can stay the hell away from Earth, cause I don't want their unemotional selves near me.4. Music. Where is it?  All I hear is a constant low, changing tone in the background.  Even bad movies and shows are saved by a good orchestra every now and then.5. Special Effects. These are actually pretty good.  I think the space battles "would" look nice if the zoom function was broken on the computer model camera for once.6. Technology.  Basically: We're lookin at an advanced race of humans with laser guns in their fighters...then a virus takes out all the cool stuff and they're stuck with machine guns.  Yeah, I know, WWII in space.7. Politics.  Now this angers me most of all.  That the show even focuses on this aspect just makes me want to lash out and destroy my TV.  The Secretary of Education takes over the presidency and instead of heeding the Admiral's advice or at least DOING WHAT'S SMART, she does stupid, moralistic crap to protect her own butt, even when she's dying from cancer.  If this happened to any nation on Earth, we'd immediately go to martial law which would supercede a political figurehead or democratic body.  I think 12 planets being wiped out and your entire race genocided constitutes a "national emergency".  And one last thing: Starbuck is a loser, end of story.If you like Desperate Housewives or the West Wing, this is for you, but if you're a trekkie, a star wars fan, or any other person that enjoys good ol' fashioned sci fi: cover your eyes and hope it gets cancelled next year.

I have had this unit for three weeks and LOVE it!  I have used the Omron HJ-112 (the basic Omron pedometer) for over a year and asked for this one for my birthday.  The pedometer is pretty much the same great pedometer as the HJ-112.  The color is different, but the function and basic size are the same.  It is the software that makes this a "must have" - even if you are happy with your current pedometer.  The software was easy to download - just pop the disk in your drive and follow the instructions.  Enter your goals (daily steps, aerobic steps, distances, etc.) and then start walking and get ready to download your info.  To download info from your unit, attach the cord provided from your unit to your computer and a prompt appears on your screen.  It downloads the information (up to a week of stats) and insert them into a chart.  I like that the information is shown as numbers, bar graphs, and colors.  It gives easy feedback regarding your progress.  NOTE:  When I received the unit, it was miscounting steps and the customer service rep on the phone was AWFUL!  She didn't know the product and offered unhelpful advice.  I emailed the company, they sent me a new battery, and it has been great ever since!  It doesn't change my rating, but I expected the service to be as good a the product

I love to put frozen mixed berries in a tupperware, and add some of this yogurt and a sprinkling of splenda. By lunchtime the berries are thawed and the yogurt is still cold, to me it's like cheesecake! I also use this yogurt in the place of sour cream, and I make a great Tzatziki by adding a little olive oil and some grated cucumber. I have used it a lot and just love it.

Upon installation Linksys program informed me that everything fine, Vista told me network is good, but of course I can't use their (Linksys) secure web site in order to change setting or configure it completely.  I understand that my old DSL modem or AT@T is at some fault (incompatibilities with Linksys).  But why Linksys doesn't fix it.  Or at least they should write on a package "don't try to connect with old modems that run on DSL".

I purchased this brand after reading many reviews of others. I have stored my important documents on this along with my music and photos. I am happy with the ease of using this drive.  I do keep it turned off while I am not using it.  One thing I did realize is its best to turn it off when shutting down your computer due to the fact when you shut your computer down at the end of the day and begin it the next time your computer will not boot up with this device on. I think it is well worth the money you pay for this storage drive when for only a 8 GB flash will cost you nearly as much.  I feel confident now should I ever have to do a restore on my computer all my important documents, photos and music will not be lost.

Mine stopped working shortly after the 90 day warranty. Was used maybe 5 times and well cared for. It keeps turning itself off even with new batteries. It appears to be a software issue that they know about since there is information about this problem on their website. The device is nicely designed though so that it lats the 90 days and then you are stuck with a piece of junk.

We've tried at least three different gates in different doorways and entrances, and this one's by far the best. It really is hands-free to open. Better yet, it closes automatically by bumping it shut, unlike some gates that require a hand to *close* them, argh.One complaint I've heard is about the foot pedal breaking off. That hasn't happened for us, and we use two of these, nor has it happened for friends (and friends of friends) who've had one of these for several years. I suspect that anyone's who broke had the gate in the entrance either too tightly or crooked. So, use the tool that comes in the box for checking the tightness, and use a level(ing device) to get it straight.

I returned this camera today as I was very disappointed with the video quality.  The picture was grainy even filmed in the highest setting in bright light.  Even tried the mini HDMI with no success.  I believe that this is related to the compression used in AVCHD.  I would recommend sticking with tape despite its lack of glamor.  Tape has better quality video and is easier to edit.  The Canon HV20 or HV30 is the way to go.  By the way, if bought at a SonyStyle store they will charge you 15% restocking fee($150) -- if that's any indication to you of my disappointment.

This is a good catbox that eliminates 99% of manual scooping.  Once in a while (every week) I still do manual scooping to catch the finer debris that the screen doesn't get.  But overall I am really satisfied.  I have 2 cats that have no problem using it and it is really easy to clean.

The second time I used this blender, while I had my hand over the lid as I was pureeing fruit, the plastic cap in the center of the lid fell through the lid and was pulverized by the blades. Based on the other reviews, the blender probably works very well, but I would consider another blender with a more soundly constructed lid.

I have had this product about 6 months running on USB 2.0 with no problems. I recently bought a brand new PC with eSATA connections, a high quality eSATA cable and the problems began. With the eSATA cable I have found the drive extremely susceptible to having its file system corrupted when the PC is restarted. This has happened twice, once causing 14GB of important data to be converted to .CHK files which I spent a week sorting out.I then had massive problems whereby the MyBook could not be reformatted under the eSATA connection. It would only work on USB 2.0.Having emailed Western Digital they told me that the likely cause is that the eSATA controller in my new PC probably isn't one which has been officially tested to work. They have only tested it with 3 manufacturers on the planet however which is absolutely comedy.I am now sticking with USB 2.0 but my faith in this drive has disappeared and I am scared about putting any important information on here.Use eSATA with Western Digital drives at your peril, its like driving your car down the highway with your eyes closed.

I just ordered and received this and tried it out, and the vacuum is a joke. It clogs almost instantly, and the attachment gets in the way of a decent cut. DO NOT BUY THIS. Go for a shower/wet trimmer like the remmington or something. This trimmer is also ugly and bulky.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) 1939 (DVD)
      

This movie is a historical film on many levels. It excellently portrays the old south, a civilization "gone with the wind." It seemlessly adapts the rather long Margaret Mitchell best seller onto the screen. It won a historic eight Oscars including the first to a black actor (Hattie McDaniel). And aside from all of these things, it is a highly entertaining film.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, I just recommend seeing the film. It has a little bit of everything, though it is certainly heavy on the sentiment. It is, after all, an homage to the glory of the old south. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a rather flirtatious girl who finds herself insanely jealous when she finds out that Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) is to marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Suddenly, the south enters a war with the north and the world becomes chaotic. A scoundrel from Charleston named Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) is a constant companion to Scarlett though she treats him badly. It is obvious that he loves her, but she is too enraptured with Ashley. Battling poverty and responsibility when she aches for the life of luxury she led before the war, Scarlett strives for happiness when everyone else has lost their strength.There are many gorgeous scenes in the movie; each scene stands out as a work of art. Who could forget the simplicity of the women strolling down the grand staircase at the Wilkes' barbeque? Or what about Eric Linden's heartwrenching screams as he fights to keep his leg? What a powerful statement the field of wounded and dying soldiers makes as the torn Confederate flag weakly waves in the breeze! And who is not jarred by the impact of the red sky against the hopelessness of the war torn fields of Georgia? Scene after scene cements itself into the unconscious and becomes more powerful with each viewing.There are many interesting behind-the-scenes stories to be told about the film, many of which are included in the 1989 documentary included on disk three. Most interesting about this piece is perhaps the audition footage with some of the top names in Hollywood. Also on this disk are features about the restoration of the film and footage of the premieres. Disk four is essential for fans of the stars of the golden age of Hollywood. We see a recently recorded bit with de Havilland where she relays memories of the making of Gone With the Wind. It is always interesting to hear firsthand information. The Gable documentary is not wonderful, but it does include memories from a longtime friend. Leigh's tribute is a bit better, and includes many clips arranged artistically for an emotional impact.

I received the mixer in mid-December and have tried to put it through its paces in the last three weeks.  I have done whole wheat bread, bagels, pugliese, cinnamon rolls and a variety of cakes and cookies (yep, I'll be reviewing a treadmill next :-)).The mixer has done everything I have asked of it.  I have done doughs that have up to 8 cups of flour without any problem (including the wheat recipe with freshly milled wheat flour).  The dough hook is simply fabulous and kneads the dough just right.The one time that I worried was when I doubled the cinnamon roll recipe so that it called for 12 cups of white flour.  The company rates this machine for up to 14 cups of flour, so I went for it.  I got all of the flour into the bowl and got about halfway through the kneading and the mixer overheated and shut off.  I waited a couple minutes and turned it back on and finished kneading.  I have decided to just limit what I do to about 8-10 cups of flour.  If you want a mixer that will do more than that, I would probably go a different direction.  For me, to do a couple batches of bread each week for my family, this machine was the best value. One other thing is that for doing a small amount of whipped cream or something, this mixer is overkill.  I guess I need to get the 3-qt. bowl and then it would be fine.Overall, I am thrilled with the product.

I wouldn't recommend this software. It freezes and skips screens.  Plus the customer support web page is sorely lacking.  It's more of a marketing forum for you to hire one of their people to prepare your forms for you.  It's definitely not geared to the DIY crowd like Turbo Tax. Their on-line chat support is quite dismal.  At least the person I "chatted" on-line with was uninformed and blatantly nonresponsive for long stretches of time. Finally he agreed to have someone in a so called higher department contact me in a few days!  Not exactly a speedy response time.

I was excited to own the Kitchen Aid Artisan Mixer. Several of my friends own this Kitchen Aid Mixer. Also, many of the Food Network cooks use this mixer. I used the mixer a few times the first year after I purchased it.  Due to an unfortunate situation, I didn't bake or use my Kitchen Aid Mixer from Feb. 2007 until Feb. 2008. The mixer sat idle. When I tried to use it this year, the motor would only work on high settings and then for only a few seconds. I contacted Kitchen Aid and they reminded me that my warranty is over. I explained the mixer was hardly used. It seems like I really got a bad product. Kitchen Aid states that they stand behind their products. They didn't do well with this one. I wish I hadn't thrown away my very old mixer of 30 plus years, made by another manufacturer. It still worked.

I bought this because it had the exact options I wanted in the price range I wanted.  The reviews looked good and the problems with locking up seemed to be few and far between.  I was wrong.  I received the ZEN and, after charging for 4.5 hours, I started loading music into it.  As soon as it finished loading, it shut itself off and never restarted.  I've now returned it and went with the Ipod because of it's better reputation for reliability.

I purchased three of these Corsair flash drives for my employer based on their competitive price and the pictures of them on Amazon. They looked like good drives online and we were not disappointed when we received them. These flash drives are well made with a rubber surface and come with a nice and thick neck lanyard. The cap stays on them very well, and in my opinion they are of much better construction than similarly priced drives from Kingston and SanDisk. You don't have to worry about the drive falling off of the inch thick lanyard and metal clasp - everything is very sturdy, and nothing about the drive feels flimsy. I wear mine around my neck every day without problems and have done so for the past six months. My boss keeps hers on a keychain and likes it as well. I don't know how their file input / output performance compares to other drives as I don't transfer large files very often, but this is a USB 2.0 drive so it can't be much different from any other drive on the market. The drive is a little think, but it includes a USB extension cable just in case you need it. In summary, if you want a flash drive, this one gives you a very good value for your money. I am planning on buying another one for my personal use.

This was a gamble that paid off. It is the first flash-based camera I have ever had. Some reviews said that it was difficult to use with a Mac. In fact, this camera is easier to use than my previous Canon HV20, takes a great picture,  and is easily edited with both iMovie 08 (blah) or Final Cut Express. I can bring it into iMovie 08 or FCE, save, and edit it in iMovie HD , as sometimes I find FCE too complicated.The only real con I have with it is the fact I cannot re-upload to the flash card, and since I sold my HV20, I have no miniDV camera to upload to. I sometimes do shows to put on local community tv, and it needs to be on miniDV. The sound from wind is a little worse than with the HV20, but I usually tape indoors.The pros include small size, no tapes to lug around, 12X zoom, superior sound from forward facing mikes, the ability to use sd cards from my photo camera, and an easy button. Often I find the easy button gets better shots than when I do the work of setting focus etc. I absolutely love the integration with Apple's FCE, as I can pull up log and transfer, and choose what clips I want to transfer over to my computer. And watching something on  a high-def tv from the hdmi connection on the camera is a joy.

This mixer was purchased as a replacement for two other hand mixers I burned out.  I am very pleased with the overall quality and having the range of speeds, particularly the extremely low speeds makes it extremely useful.  I already own a KitchenAid stand mixer, over 20 years old and has more accessories than I do and the "little sister" hand mixer is another example of KitchenAid quality

Trust me do not buy this player if u plan to watch movies every review ive read said audio and video goes out and everytime u email them they give u different people so they keep telling u to do the same thing over and over horrible support ( i know a few people who have recently bought this and they all have had the same problem), I purchased this for videos and audio. The video player was a horrible experience for me. the video converter that came with the player took hours to convert, and when it finally converted when i would fast-forward the audio would start about 5 seconds to early while the video was still loading. i have tried converting into all forms xvid dvix5/6 wmv avi no matter what i did at the resolution suggested and 30 fps it would go out of sync. at first i didnt mind because the audio only goes out of sync if u fast forward but then if u use the resume play capability it will go out of sync also. this made the video player useless because if u dont watch the movie all at once  it would be impossible to resume where you last left off.the audio was just ok but i noticed that some songs regardless of 128kbps or 320kbps rips there would be crackling sounds in the back (for some songs) the screen gets scratched pretty easily and the whole front of the player gets filled with finger prints. i actually lost this player recently and im not to mad because now i can buy a new better player. maybe the creative vision w , or iriver, or sansa view, i would suggest to look at other players and use you tube to figure out which player is for you

Once we get past the lengthy travelogue and setup, the remainder of the movie is a snap to predict.  In fact, it is a wide screen, color version of a 1930s western.A hoity toity English lady (Nicole Kidman) goes to Australia in 1938 to dispose of a cattle station (ranch) that is not profitable.  She meets a scruffy cattle drover (Hugh Jackman) and discovers that her husband has just died at the rundown station. And, oh, there's a cute, ragged, intelligent Aborigine boy who loses his mother.  Soon they all set out with a herd of cattle to sell at the port to save the station from an unscrupulous rival rancher.  I suspect that most anyone can write the rest of what happens.Kidman looks aristocratic, then sweaty.  Jackman looks sweaty, then shaven and presentable.  They recite their lines without much interest, but that's OK, because the lines aren't very interesting.  The only thing worthwhile is the scenery of a barren outback that doesn't look as if it could support one cow, much less a herd.Avoid this one.  See it only if you must.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (DVD)
      

By which I mean that Mr. Reiner, at this stage of his career, was still somewhat naive enough to think he was blazing a new trail with this material.  But tongue-in-cheek swashbucklers have been around since the Silent Era, and a serious movie-buff will not see anything that hasn't been done better before.  (*Raiders Of The Lost Ark*  made earlier in the decade is just for starters.)  The fact that the movie seems pitched to adults as much as to children doesn't absolve it from unoriginality . . . and in any case, rest assured that there's nothing TOO  &quot;grown-up&quot;  going here, nothing that would really fly over the kids'  heads, at any rate.  The immaturity also shows in the directing style, which was doubtless formed from the director's situation-comedy background:  stagey sets, relentless close-ups, so forth.  Even worse, Reiner insists on framing the story with a modern-day Grandpaw, READING the story to his grandson who's in bed with a cold  (another device straight from TV-Land -- bet on it, Grandpaw will eventually smile, turn out the light, and close the door).  There are several problems, here:  first, Peter Falk's makeup  (why didn't Reiner just hire an older actor?); second, he's reading to the kid what we're already witnessing; third, the story keeps getting interrupted by the sudden shifts away from the fantasy world and back to the prosaic modern day  (very annoying -- halfway through, one starts sitting on the edge of his seat, waiting for the next interruption.  Not the way to tell a story).  Oh . . . and  &quot;don't get me stahted&quot;  on Billy Crystal's  &quot;comic&quot;  cameo. . . .Okay, so I'm being a little harsh.  I just felt that, considering the almost hysterical partiality some have for this  &quot;cult&quot;  classic, a correction was long overdue.

I love this cologne and I actually hesistate to even call it cologne, because that just sounds way too "stuffy" for this sensual fragrance.  My husband had worn the same cologne for years and I wanted to find something else for him, so during my next shopping trip I sampled mens fragrances and this one just screamed SENSUAL AND SEXY.  I bought it on the spot.... My hubby loves it and I love it.  Every time I smell this on him, it just strikes me over and over again what a sexy fragrance this is and I never tire of smelling it.   I highly recommend this, it is totally irresistible to women.

As for the Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler, the first one I received was defective (more on that at the end of this review). The replacement product I received works fine.  The Griddler is very stylish-looking with brushed stainless steel and "retro" styled knobs.  The top of the unit gets very hot during cooking and should not be touched without a protective mitt.  It takes several minutes to heat up, no matter what temperature you select, which I found a bit surprising.  It also takes a very long time for the unit to cool down once you are finished cooking.  It helps to leave the unit in the open position for faster cooling, but you can plan on waiting at least 30-60 minutes for it to cool down to where you can safely clean it.  A light on the grill/griddle selector knob turns red when the unit is switched on, and a separate light on the temperature knob turns green to indicate when the desired temperature is reached.  The product works as advertised.  It can be used as a panini press or opened flat for a two-section open-faced griddle.  There are two sets of metal plates that come with the Griddler - a flat set and a set with ridges.  They are coated with non-stick material and therefore only plastic or nylon utensils should be used with the Griddler to avoid scratching the plates.  The plates are easily interchanged and washed.  They are also dishwasher-safe.  You don't want to break or lose them - they cost $30 each to replace on Cuisinart's web site.  There are two cheap plastic collection cups that can be placed at the corner of the griddle to collect grease.  They are quite small, and do not hold much.  A cheap plastic cleaning tool is also provided to help clean the grill plates.  I have not needed to use it.  Overall, I am happy with the Griddler.  I paid $109.95 for it, which I believe is a good value.  It would be over-priced at the $199 suggested retail price.  Cuisinart's quality control and customer service with this product was surprisingly poor.  Before having to return the defective unit I tried to get a replacement manual from Cuisinart.  They promised to send one in 7-10 days which never arrived.  That's the only reason I docked the Griddler a star.Speaking of poor customer service, my first Griddler arrived from Amazon.com in an open shipping carton with the flaps loosely closed rather than taped shut.  The manufacturer's box for the Griddler, however, appeared to be unopened.  Nonetheless, the product arrived with no instruction manual or registration material, and one of the switches on the front of the product was loose and sparked when the unit was plugged in.  I returned the product for a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is terrible.  There is no telephone number to explain the problem to a customer service rep (I challenge you to find any phone number of this nature on their entire web site).  Instead you must request a refund or replacement by email.  They direct you to download a form to cut & paste onto your package to return the product by USPS (with no tracking) at no cost.  Alternatively, you can elect to send it by other means, although there is no mention of how they will reimburse you for the shipping cost (although they claim they will do so).  Since there is no telephone number to call for clarification, I would be very skeptical about it.  I sent my package back by USPS, but I have no way to prove it.  A company the size of Amazon.com should have far better customer service than this.  They should at least have a phone number you can call about problems with your order.  It is clear they would rather not have to deal with their customers about problems.  Having ordered thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon over the years, it has really made me think about ordering anything of major value from them in the future.Addendum (3/21/06) - since I wrote this initial review Amazon has added a link to contact a customer service representative by telephone.  To access it, click on "Help" in their main menu and click on the "Ordering" link.  To the right is a link to request a telephone contact.  I used this link for another order issue, and it worked very well.  The representative called me back immediately.  Clearly, Amazon has made an effort to improve their customer service.

Well... I'll just say that I have had better experiences with new computers. I like the form factor and the cool yellow color but Ubuntu is simply a pain in the neck. I can understand that some Linux enthusists might like twiddling with Ubuntu, but I don't. I sent it back and ordered something else. The camera was flaky and wireless is a hassle on any variant of Linux. When I buy a new computer, I want something that works out of the box, not a science project.

What was this cartoon-like gibberish all over the screen? Where were the menu bars? Icons! Icons! Everywhere icons! All I could think was I had accidentally received the Student Edition for Pre-schoolers.It is a nightmare to navigate. If you scroll over one of the cartoon icons; you get a pull-down menu that makes a Rubik's Cube look easy. I think MS forgot the most important rule of all - K.I.S.S.I have used Excel and Word almost every day for the last ten years. Like others who have commented on this new version, I make my own menu/tool bars and can navigate through the programs with no problems. There are always a few adjustments when a newer version arrives which is fine. But this? Forget it! I have removed 2007 and reloaded 2003. Back to the drawing board on this one Microsoft!

We've had this coffee maker for a little over a year now and I thought it necessary to write a follow up review. For the first year or so this coffee pot was great. It brewed consistently good coffee and kept it warm (not hot) in the insulated carafe as promised. However after a year of use the coffee pot is really sluggish when brewing and automatically shuts off in 15 minutes. So unless you watch to be sure it is actually done brewing you will only be helping yourself to a cup or two rather than a whole pot of coffee. This is REALLY annoying. I have cleaned the machine many times running h20 and vinegar through but this has had no effect. It is like the machine strains to pump the water through. Also, because of this you can not be in a hurry to brew your coffee because it could take at least 20 minutes or more to brew a full pot. For a coffee maker with this price tag I would certainly expect more than a year of service out of it. Too bad. Because of this I would no longer recommend this coffee maker.

I purchased 3 of these coffee makers for my office and have been very pleased with the performance.  Not only does the coffee actually stay steaming HOT for 6-8 hours after brewing, it actually still tastes fresh at the end of the day.  On one of the units, the metal base came off the thermal carafe after several months of use.  After a single phone call, the entire carafe was replaced free of charge by Zojirushi Customer Service.  If you are looking for a thermal carafe coffee maker, I would highly recommend this product.

I am an engineer and fairly handy with mechanical items. The first one of these I bought started to leak when it brewed after a couple months. This was a small internal leak, not the overflowing people get when the basket or caraffe is inserted improperly. I didn't have my reciept, so I bought a second one. It worked three months, then the thermostatic switch quit. I kept my reciept, and inquired about warranty repair. My concern was that I would spend more on postage than the product is worth. I called the help line to find out about their policies. They would not even answer my questions without me supplying personal informstion, including my phone number. No way am I going to give them my phone number. They told me to get my question answered elsewhere (without telling me where) and hung up on me. So I took it back to the place of purchase and exchanged it for a new one. My latest coffee maker has bad electronics out of the box. The display shows wrong segments, but the clock may actually be working. I just use the manual button, so I don't care. I expect more problems withing a month or so, and at that time, warranty or not, I WILL NOT HAVE A BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCT IN MY HOME! Good design, but poor quality componants. Very rude customer service (Motto: "We're not happy until you'r not happy.").

The juicer seems well made and has a powerful motor but it takes an enormous amount of food to produce a little bit of juice because a lot of the fiber, which you want, goes to the pulp holder.  So there is right much loss there and I think it's due to the wire mesh basket being very fine.  If it were less fine, it would be a really great product but it makes the difference in an "ok" product versus a "great" product.

Used this router for about 2 weeks before I returned it - the setup was easy and feature set / speeds are good - but wireless connectivity becomes intermittent  after a few days of operation - then the wireless radio shuts down. Also to make matters worse the administrative web page errors out when the router reaches this state  - only way out is to do a hard reset and setup everything again - but the pattern repeats...Linksys support confirms they have had such issues with the router. YMMV. Try at your own risk.

You need to get out more. Just the fact that you are looking at this page and are thinking of upgrading your Microsoft Office makes it clear that you have a problem. Don't believe the Microsoft advertisement featuring dinosaurs to announce "Microsoft Office Has Evolved." It hasn't. This is a mature product. It doesn't matter if you use Office 1997, 2000 or 2003. They are all the same. The good, the bad and the ugly. It is all still here. Maybe a few bugs have been fixed. Most haven't, and there are always new bugs. If Microsoft took the time to really improve the software, that would be one thing. But they don't.Here is an example. You are in Outlook. You call up a contact and want to send that person a letter. You need to print an envelope, but there is no command to do so. There is no button to click. You can't right click anywhere to print an envelope. I am not making this up. Outlook has been out for almost ten years and multiple upgrades, and Microsoft still hasn't gotten around to implementing functionality to print a single envelope. Your only option (the on-line support confirms this) is to perform a mail merge. This is an elaborate process that is designed for printing thousands of envelopes for a bulk mailing. It involves opening multiple windows and setting all sorts of settings. You have to go through the ENTIRE PROCESS just to print a single envelope! What is more, the mail merge feature has bugs in it. It leaves blank lines in addresses that look atrocious, and it drops country names from addresses. It gives you options as to how you want country names treated in addresses, but these all do nothing. Whatever option you select, Outlook leaves countries out of addresses when it prints envelopes.I could go on, but I won't. If you are using Office 2000 or even Office 1997, you aren't missing out on anything. There is absolutely no reason to shell out $400 for new software that does all the same things in all the same ways with mostly the same bugs.

My specs:2.4GHZ Penryn2GB Ram (About to upgrade to 4GB)256MB Nvidia GPUSuperdriveMulti-Touch trackpadI debated between this laptop and a black macbook for a long time. I weighed all of the options vs price and to be honest, I bought this one even though it didn't look as good to me on paper. I'm so glad I decided to buy this one over the black macbook. The larger screen gives me more than enough room to multitask (but it does not take away from the portability of the laptop). The backlit keyboard and multi-touch track pad are irreplaceable. I am constantly working on computers and find it really hard to use the track pads on our HP TX1000 laptops. The laptop is more than fast enough for what I use it for (web browsing, movies, iTunes, movie editing). I am looking at upgrading to 4GB ram in the next week just to squeeze everything I can out of this computer. Build quality is excellent and battery life is better than any pc laptop I've ever owned. Speakers sound incredible! Leopard is a good OS and I love iMovie and garageband! Photobooth is fun with the built-in camera.  I only have a few complaints. It gets HOT! When downloading torrents or doing any kind of video editing, this thing heats up fast (although it cools down very fast due to the aluminum casing). It could use more usb ports, but I rarely find myself needing more (only when I need to plug in my iPod, blackberry and usb memory stick). Wireless is a little finicky when traveling from work/home/public wifi, especially if each network has different ip schemes. All this took was a little profile setting and I was good to go.

I recently purchased this coffee maker.  I loved the idea of being able to grind & brew at the same time.  I am VERY disappointed with this coffee maker.  The coffee it makes is OK but you need to use a lot of coffee beans because some of the ground beans don't make it to the filter.  The left over coffee clumps up due to the moisture in the unit so the grinder needs to be washed after EVERY use.  I'm disappointed this coffee maker doesn't work better & I'm returning to my separate grinder & coffee maker.

The assertions of this work and others of this ilk cannot be disproved. It is impossible to provide proof that you don't create your own reality. Supposedly, if you think the correct thoughts, you will create desired outcomes. If you do not have your desired outcomes, it is your own fault, because you obviously haven't thought the correct thoughts. If these ideas could be disproved, then if people did not manifest whatever they thought, we could conclude that the idea that they create their own reality is incorrect. But no. The idea that you create your own reality can never be proved incorrect for many reasons. If people thought the correct thoughts but didn't get what they wanted, they either didn't really think correctly, didn't think the thoughts for long enough, or don't believe they genuinely deserve whatever they want to manifest. Notice how it is utterly impossible to prove the idea of creating your own reality wrong. That is, no evidence can ever be interpreted in a way that suggests that you do not create your own reality. If an idea can't be proved wrong, well, it can be proved right, either.At first, the notion that you create your own reality seems rather harmless. Actually, it has the potential to create considerable distress. The genuine tragedy behind this set of ideas is that it makes people who are truly suffering blame themselves. Those who are poor, abused, handicapped, etc. are led to believe that they have brought these conditions on themselves. Perhaps those who origninated these ideas thought that they might motivate folks who are poor or handicapped or abused. In fact, those who are already suffering often feel worse because they think they have brought their conditions on themselves. There is an extra layer of damage that arises from the notion that you create your own reality. Changing thoughts actually does have a meaningful impact on mood and behavior. (This is probably what Epictetus and others meant by the power of thoughts.) Therapies that have proven effective often rely on challenging maladaptive thoughts so people can feel better and build meaningful lives. Unfortunately, people who have endured the kind of unfalsifiable reasoning put forward in works like this one are apprehensive about using the effective therapies. The effective therapies seem reminiscent of the notion that you create your own reality, an idea that made them miserable in the past. So this work is not only untrue, it is potentially damaging.

The scale works well.  It does not dither the way the older types do, depending on how or where you stand on it.  The weights given are consistent from one day to the next, and over a period of time.  The percent body fat and body mass index look OK, but are hard to understand.  Hopefully they will prove instructive over a period of time, as my weight goes down.

I am 26 years old, apple-shaped, and 5'3 with big calfs and arms, so I got this workout in an attempt to have that dancer's body. It's about 45min straight of fast-paced dance performance cardio. No wonder pop stars are so toned and skinny. It's hard to do that for 45 min straight. The only thing is they must have really good dance instructors helping them get the moves... This video is like trying to learn every move Britney does in her high-impact dance moves just by watching. It will take quite a while, but I guess it's doable.I'm giving this 2 stars, because she doesn't cue you at all during the dances. During the section that she teaches you each dance slowly, you never actually do it to music two times in a row to get the feel of the transition. Also, when you do difficult transitions in slow motion, it looks and feels completely different than the actual real-time dance moves.Great workout if you can learn it. I think I'll keep trying begrudgingly bc I want a dancers body. Let me know if you know a cardio workout that would give me lean calves and arms...Her mat workout is awesome, though.

Some day Michael Bay may be involved in a movie that isn't a clone of a previous production. This movie is nothing but Armageddon with robots.  Having ( thank God ) never seen it in a theater the first time I viewed it in HD DVD it felt like I'd seen it before. After a half hour I realized that I had seen it several times only it was called Armageddon. Earth in danger-check    Lots of shots of helicopters-check ( I swear he has some twisted attraction to them )    Bullets flying-check    Everyday guy to the rescue-check.  I swear the scores could be swapped and you'd never know the difference (Pearl Harbor as well ). If someone were to take the time to go through both movies I'd bet they could find at least a dozen identical camera shots.If you loved Armageddon or the Rock and don't mind the same thing in a different package you'll love this. Myself I'm had enough of Bay's endless clone movies.

I bought the flip a few days prior to birth of my first child. We used in while my wife was in labor and it worked out great. Since all our immediate family came, but they could not all be in the delivery room, we were able within minutes of the delivery to share the video with them. It works easy, just like it says. The only other comment is that my laptop USB plugs are not at the same height as the USB plug on the flip, so I end up propping up my laptop about 1/3 of an inch so that they line up better.

This product was nice looking and seemed great.  We never had a chance to use it and needed to return it because it is NOT compatible with iTunes.  My other family members already had various iPods and we have an extensive music library with iTunes.  We would have had to use Rhapsody and rebuy all the songs or copy them onto a disc (each only holding 20 songs) then reload them and then copy onto the MP3.  Doing this would also not list the album cover or information.  Beware that most MP3's are not made to work with iTunes.

Not very happy with this product. I am still debating on weather or not to return it. I found it very difficult trying to remove the blade and almost broke the the plastic trying to loosen it. I finally got a butter knife and ended up scratching the plastic trying to get it off to clean. Anything I have tried to slice always seems to bunch up near the bottom of the blade. I don't feel that it slices very even either. On a positive note once the blade is removed it is easy clean up.

I've been using the Braun 7526 shaver and cleaning stand for 5+ years, and have found it to be the best balance of close shave with minimal irritation. I work in a chemistry lab so anytime I have a device that uses a "solution" I try to think how I can mimic it and save money and time. I make my own aftershave lotion by mixing rubbing alcohol + baby oil + water, mostly alcohol (17 parts), oil (3 parts), water (1 part), more oil if you want your skin to be softer, but it will shine. Shake well before each use. For the Braun cleaning solution, be aware that the red light comes on due to the level dropping low; it has nothing to do with the amount of hair debris in the solution. Dump the remaining solution; add water through the small hole and shake well to get as much of the hair debris out of the container. I use two ingredients in the solution: rubbing alcohol and finger nail polish remover (non-drying lemon scented). The volume of the solution is a little less than 6 ounces, but I make a mark on the side using a Sharpie when the container is new, and just fill to that level each time. Just add a couple ounces alcohol through the small hole (I got a small funnel at a hobby store), add a tablespoon (15 mL) of polish remover, slosh to mix, then add alcohol to the mark being sure the container is on a level surface. You can try to mix or let the shaver mix it when it recirculates. The polish remover is good at removing the oils left on the cutter/foil, and the non-drying formula leaves a trace of oily ingredient that seems to help lube the shaver as well. Use at your own risk.

My little Asus Eee PC1000HA arrived yesterday early afternoon, and I've been on it ever since, doing work and testing its potential.  I'm delighted with it overall--it's no surprise that, as of December 31, 2008, it's sold out at Amazon.  I did a huge amount of research on netbooks before purchasing this, and the other Amazon reviewers (for all the different netbooks researched) were most helpful. Their warning that this is only an atom processor is a good one--this doesn't work as fast as my five year old Gateway 200XL (XP pro, centrino processor, 1.6mhz, 512mb RAM, 60gb hd), which I just loved until it ran out of hard drive space and could not be upgraded. On the other hand, the Eee PC1000HA really is great for internet and word processing--what it is designed to do.  I had to turn off various background-working programs, like webshots and google indexing, but these are still useful, within limits.  Don't run an anti-virus scan while working, either. When all the background programs were turned off, internet access, even internet video, was speedy on my wireless connection, with no gaps (or gasps) at all. Here's what I really like about this machine:1)  It's pretty quiet--much quieter than the old Sony Vaio picturebook I used to use.  I'm a student, and the Eee PC will not draw the negative attention in a small graduate class the way the Sony picturebook did (and so I had to stop using the Sony and sell it).2) The screen is clear and the 10.2 inch display is quite adequate.  I don't really miss a bigger screen at all.3)  The keyboard really is do-able (except for that blasted right shift key--it is quite a stretch for my little finger, even with a smaller keyboard).  But that is adjustable, too.  (See previous reviewer regarding downloading free software that allows users to change keys.)4) I can watch my news video clips with no lags at all. 5) BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT!  It really is 7 hours with (a) LCD lighted display turned down all the way, (b) wireless off.  In other words, if all you have to do is word processing, you can do it.  Otherwise, 6 hrs with wireless and lowest light LCD, and 5 hrs with wireless and highest light LCD. 6) The upgradeability is the best on any machine I've ever seen!  Not only are the RAM and hard drive easily removable and replacable, but so is the wireless adapter!  Now THAT is really COOL!  Still, I'm quite pleased with the wireless and its speediness.What I don't like:1) I don't like this touchpad so much.  Now, don't get me wrong--I prefer touchpads to a mouse, but I really miss the old synaptic touchpads.  I could do all kinds of great things with the synaptic touchpads of the olden days, and all with one finger!  Now I have to learn a whole new touchpad sign language, and even then, the touchpad is not as responsive as I'm used to on older laptops. The scrolling, for example, is inconsistent. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The Elantech smart pad is not as easily programmable as the old synaptic touchpad on my Gateway 200XL.  What ever happened to Synaptic?  Why throw away what was great?  On the other hand, this touch pad still does not drive me crazy the way the touchpad does on machines like the HP Pavilion 2660SE.  So, Elantech is a step in the right direction, at least, even if it hasn't gotten as far as what the old synaptic touchpad could do with just ONE little finger (not two or three).  That said, even when you take the time to learn the new sign language, the Elantech touchpad still doesn't scroll as easily as a single quick stroke of my finger used to on the old synaptic. With the Elantech, I have to keep stroking the touchpad to scroll--too many movements!2) I don't like the hard drive light under my right wrist--I can't tell if the hard drive is being written to or not.  I like having the hard drive light visible, and this is not positioned well to make it easily seen, unless I stop typing and remove my hand.3) A nice size hard drive...and they partitioned it!  UGH!  Forget that they tell you it's 160gb--it's really 80gb on one partition and 61gb on the other.  So their math is off (80+61=141 gbs, not 160).  I have used an old HP nc4000 that does read all 160gb on the hard drive, so I can't figure out why the 1000HA misses 19gb on its hard drive, even with the updated bios. So, for the touchpad, which is less than the old synaptic quality and simplicity, I give this little machine 4 stars, not 5.  But so far, I'm delighted that I got this from Amazon before it sold out. Amazon's deal was the most affordable option for this model (with these specs for hard drive and battery life), and I looked everywhere, even at Best Buy. So all in all, this will serve my needs very well and I'm delighted with it.

Before I make any purchase I try to look around and find the most affordable and reliable solution. However, I wish I took more care into doing so when researching my external hard drive. Lets spill out a little tale.I was recently switching my Windows laptop over to a Linux build. Before doing so I backed up all of my data and client's data onto my 500GB Seagate External hard drive. After awhile of fooling around on the distribution and realizing the emulation capabilities were not what I hoped of some Windows based programs I switched back. (No hard feelings Linux, I still love you and use you in other ventures.) However when I went to plug my Seagate hard drive in nothing happened. I went and opened it up and the drive looked like it was completely blank. I unplugged it and switched over to my desktop. This time all the folders were there, but empty. Shut everything down checked connections, pins, made sure everything was plugged in and then powered everything on. Again, no data was shown.In somewhat of a panic since a clients project was due that week I contacted their customer support, who seems to work more off of sales then to help. While I was on with the representative who took forever to respond between inquiries I started researching Seagates data recovery and analysis tools. When I mentioned these to the customer support he said "DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO YOUR HARD DRIVE. SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN AND DO NOT TOUCH IT." Yes, caps. Then being told that Seagate's "Remote Data Recovery" service would cost close to $1400 I promptly left. After searching and trying various options I did eventually get my data off of the hard drive. However it was a daunting task. I would advise anyone, who needs to backup their data to stay away from Seagate. I have yet to use any other physical back up solution. I rely heavily on Amazon's amazing S3 services. So, buyers, if you happen to be revamping your system and want to buy an external hard drive go ahead, get a Seagate. They will only cost you $1500. Or, you can try out S3 and pay pennies per month for only the space that you use.

My husband bought this, and I thought it was very expensive for a coffee maker, and I doubted that it could keep the coffee warm without the typical warmer under the pot. I was wrong. The convenience of being able to take the coffee straight to the table is matched by how well this thermos keeps it hot. We bring a full pot to the table and read three newspapers each morning, and the last cups are always as hot as the first.The machine brews very quickly, is easy to program so that the pot is ready for you when you wake up, and it's as easy as any other maker I've had to clean. I like the fact that I can't break the pot, and I don't EVER have to worry about whether I left it on when I leave the house. So for all that, this coffee maker is worth the money, and it looks like my husband was right. Just don't tell him.  ;)

Let's start with this, I love this machine, is small, compact, beautiful and powerful.  It runs cold, it's easy to carry and it's easy to work with it.  Running Mac OS X, Windows or Linux every task is a breeze.  The 2.4ghz processor is fast and runs cold.  The 2gigs of ram is sufficient for my daily tasks, but for more powerful multitasking upgrade to 4 gigs.  The machine have all the connectivity i need, sans firewire, but I can live without firewire.  Beware this machine will hurt relationships!!

I've tried a number of products with my australian shepherd who's not a huge fan of being groomed.  Tried a 'shedding blade' which was effective in removing hair but she wouldn't sit still very long.  The FURminator is equally effective and she tolerates it much better.   Also easier to use.

I purchased this computer for my 4 yr old daughter in an attempt to stop her playing around with my laptop. However, sometimes I find myself using her laptop while she is asleep. It basically does everything my full-sized laptop does and more. However, given the overall size of the laptop, people with large fingers may have a little difficulty typing a lot of data. Overall, it is a wonderful machine with all the necessary stuff - wifi, webcam, built in mic etc. It even comes with the drivers if you decide to load Windows XP on it (although changing the OS probably isn't necessary).

I bought this toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist.  I've been using it for almost 5 months now, and I have to say, I'm not sure it's working as well as it should be.  I seem to be getting more plaque, and in spots I didn't get plaque before.  Plus, I can feel that my teeth aren't as "clean" and smooth as they should be in the back.  I've started using a regular toothbrush on them afterwards, which solves the problem, but I thought the Sonicare was supposed to be a super cleaner.  Also, I agree with other reviewers about the brush heads.  Mine looks very worn at this point--in fact, it began looking that way after just a couple of months.  I bought one for my kid as well, and his teeth are also showing more plaque (and the brush head looks even worse than mine, though he's been using it for about 4 months instead of 5).  So I'm not sure this is worth it--I'm going to talk to our dentist and dental hygienist at our next checkups.  (No problems other than that, by the way--the vibration/pressure takes a little getting used to, but the "easy start" feature helps a lot.  If you don't keep the toothbrush constantly in its charger, the recharging takes a very long time--too long, for instance, if you're on vacation, so bring an extra brush along.)

The Spray Sense collars used to be great and last a long time.  In the last year I have bought 5 and they either broke after a couple of weeks or didn't work at all out of the box.  The company told me they are having trouble with the manufacturer and replaced 3 collars so far.  Haven't used them yet so can't say if they are any better.  They look the same as the ones I returned.

I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She (we) have three cats.  In the past she would brush them everyday with an old hair brush.  She saw a commercial about the FURminator and wanted one.  This thing WORKS!  Christmas day she brushed all three and you would not believe the fur that came out.  And this is from cats that were brushed every day.  The kitties feel softer now and they seem to enjoy being brushed by this thing every bit as much as the hair brushes.

I am a long-time TurboTax user and just grabbed the 2008 product as I have every other year to begin my taxes.  It was only later that I realized what crazy changes Intuit has made to the price and services for this product.  They now force you to buy e-File even though I have never used it nor will this year.  AND they now require you to pay an additional fee for additional returns you prepare.  You used to be able to do five returns at no extra cost, but now it's $9.95 for each additional return.  So they RAISED the cost substantially and DECREASED the services available to you.  What are they thinking?!  Do they think we really have extra money to throw around these days?  I've been telling EVERYONE I know NOT to use TurboTax this year, and I WON'T return to them if this is they way they intend to do business.

Have nothing but good things to say about the abilities if this storage device. My only complaint is the difference in actual storage size and stated storage size. I understand losing some space for transfer area but there is a big difference between 465 and 500GB. Would have given this produce a 5 star rating if not for that.

Miami forensics analyst and moonlighting serial killer Dexter Morgan survived in part through the first two seasons of Showtime's groundbreaking drama by mastering mimicry.  In order to avoid suspicion as the "quiet loner", Dexter pretended to be an Average Joe and forced himself to maintain a girlfriend, take an interest in the lives of his co-workers and join a bowling league.  His fans have known, however, he'd rather be home researching his next project.That aspect of Dexter's life changes in Season Three of television`s greatest drama.  In addition to deepening feelings for Rita and circumstances that lead him to thoughts of being a husband to her and a father to her children, Dexter develops his first true friendship with Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits in the kind of role he was born to play).  Through their connections to a case, Dexter and Miguel slowly begin to see the darkness common in each other, leading Dexter to thoughts of adding a sidekick for his Dark Avenger alter ego.  Fans of the sociopath on display in the early episodes of the series may find faults with the humanizing of Dexter in Season Three.  Topics can arise in discussions about the show as to whether the sociopath Dexter is slowly being cured (something that is supposed to be impossible) or whether he has never truly been a sociopath at all, just someone who thinks he is and thus behaves as such.Season Three is a worthy addition to the Dexter library, a series that explores new aspects of his personality, while remembering to address the core concerns of his relationship with his sister, his memories of his father and his nocturnal practice of cleaning up the streets of Miami.  With the new truths of Dexter reveled in Season Three, you may start to question whether Dexter targets criminals because of the Code and because they are easy prey or whether Dexter does indeed have feelings and believes he is bringing justice and order to the world with his noble deeds.

Don't spend your money and time on Office 2007 (Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, ect 2007) if you have Windows XP or Vista.I tried to install and use Office 2007 and it really messed up my Vista computer and now even older versions of Office (including Outlook, FrontPage, XML Editor 2007 along with a few games) don't run correctly even after Office 2007 was uninstalled due to damage caused in your Windows System Registry.I spent (listed below) on the phone (toll-free) with Microsoft's various techs to fix the problem and even then I had to contact a "Geek" to walk me through fully removing this software.MICROSOFT TECH SUPPORT ASSISTANCE * 4hrs. 23min with Microsoft Office 2007 Tech Support [Jitendra in India] * 2hrs. 16min with Microsoft Office 2007 Software Escalation Team Support [Jim Cameron in Canada] * 3hrs. 7min. with Microsoft Windows Vista Technical Support [Jagjit Aheer in India]* 2hrs. 48min. with Microsoft Windows Vista Senior Support [Shane Daley in Washington]* 2hrs. 12min. with Microsoft Software Research, Development & Programing [Paul Crawford in Washington]and the problem was still not fixed!I then contacted a tech friend of mine in Folsom who works for Geek Squad who informed I should have talked with him first before I ever thought of purchasing the "Office 2007 Nightmare" (as they call it) because it has some serious bugs, freezes and shut-down issues in the core of the program which effects many other software programs installed on your computer. He also told me that Office 2007 uses a whole new file extension ( .docm & .docx to name a few ) which can not be read or viewed on older versions of Office until Microsoft releases a plug-in that actually works. I was told that if I want a good, stable, reliable and multi-extension "Office-type" software suite for my Windows Vista OS I should purchase one of the current Windows Vista compatible versions like WordPerfect or most any software other then Office 2007!Just a word of warning.I returned this software to Amazon.com and went with Word Perfect Office X3 which came with more software for a lesser price and no headache.

This review is from: The Princess Bride (20th Anniversary Edition) (DVD)
      

This movie was my first introduction to the story of The Princess Bride and for years I loved watching it. This movie is seriously a hit for all ages. It keeps young children interested and gives the adults jokes to laugh at. The comedy with sarcastic undertones, the simplicity of good vs bad, the impossible feats accomplished and of course, the awesome performances from the actors were all players in what makes this movie fun to watch. There is a prince and a princess, bandits, fighting, magic, and love. All under two hours. And yet for all the times I've watched this film, I never knew about the book by William Goldstein. Folks,this is one good read. The humor is more prominent than what you pick up on from the movie and it gives you background info on characters like Fezzik and Indigo. While it is much more encompassing than the movie, the movie stays true to the book which is another reason to like it. I would recommend both movie and book to those looking for a fun plot to follow.

Honestly, this is the best baby product I've ever purchased.  I got the extension, too, so it takes up a big chunk of our living room, and it's PERFECT for our little crawler.  We put some cushy rugs on our hardwood so that she doesn't get hurt when she topples, and the space is big enough that we go lie down and play with her.  Best product ever.  Right up there with the Ergo Baby Carrier.

I received this item as a Christmas present.  I have used Sandisk products before and other family members have this exact model.My player has a few issues.Surprisingly, the one thing that everyone else had a problem with, I didn't - the audio jack is fine.  The problem I had started from Day One:Randomly (well, about every forty songs) my player likes to start a song on max-volume, then freeze all controls for about six seconds.  Yes, that means the Fuze blasts my music uber-loud, where I then have to yank the ear-buds out and fiddle with the buttons until the song changes.I was prepared to suck it up and deal with it.  But then (just now), I had another volume attack, so I changed the song and tossed the player on my bed.  The screen went black, because I have it set to a 5-second background.  When I checked a few moments later, the player had appeared to have turned off.And it won't turn back on.  Even when I repeatedly plugged it into a computer and thwacked it a few times.As a product, it's a good mp3 player.  But the bugs?  No thanks.

With the crystals instead of the litter sand, it doesnt leave any left over residue, about every 2 days or so we tip the box over and get rid of the clumps.About every 2 weeks or so we open the top up and just dump all the litter left.SO EASY!I would buy it again!

I read many reviews on this item ranging from "dont buy it" to "great product" and I was worried when I finally decided to buy it. However, this product works great and I am beginning to wonder about the people who wrote the bad reviews. This product does not leak, it is not noisy (when kept properly filled with water) and it does not collect mildew and mold or the other horrible things mentioned by other consumers. The plastic is extremely easy to clean and it takes me less than five minutes to clean it. The only "problem" with the product is the pump. The problem is that the pump supposedly clogs easily and you must take it apart to clean it etc., but I did read a helpful hint about this: wrap the pump in a piece of pantyhose and no fur and crumbs will enter the pump. So I did just that and I have had no problems with any part of this machine. My cat is not afraid of it nor is she angry I took her stagnant bowl away. I do suspect that if your kitty like to drink falling water, such as from a faucet, she may enjoy the "other" product more. Keep in mind that the "other" product is noisier (falling water). This product on the other hand is extremely quiet. Best of all, this product costs almost 50% less. In my opinion, this is a better product to start the cat off with getting aquainted with fountains not because it costs less but because it more mimics the stand alone bowl. Then maybe when the cat gets adjusted to this fountain you can buy the "other" fountain that lets the water fall in a stream. There is nothing wrong with two fountains anyway, my cats had bowls all over the house. My guess is that it adds some fun in their day.

A friend kept raving about an online movie called, "The Secret." He appeared to be well- read and well-versed in marketing and business development, so I was intrigued that something had gotten him this excited.  The online movie was $4.95 compared to the CD set of $29.95.  What could I lose by watching a documentary about achieving success for 90 minutes for less than $5.00? After sitting down and watching the movie, I came away asking myself, "What did I miss?" What did my friend see that I didn't causing him to start a "Laws Of Attraction" group?  As a practitioner within the field of human development, this information was Self-Mastery 101.  The people interviewed in the movie fell right into place with the ominous, seemingly arcane backdrop.  I could easily conclude that my extensive reading on the subject matter made the movie appear overly simplistic.  But, an adherent of any of the world religions should echo similar sentiments.  Instead of a deity, "The Secret" credits the indomitable will of the human spirit.  It doesn't use those words, but one could easily surmise the point.  "The Secret" uses the basic tenets of world religions mixed with the motivational messages of the 1990's shrouded in a "Da Vinci Code"-like motif.     The real "secret" is the effective ways by which religion, motivation and marketing is synergistically molded to create a sense of newness out of archaic messages.  Should you watch "The Secret?"  Yes, not merely for the oft- quoted principles projected, but to get a sense of how concepts presented persuasively can capture the imagination of the populous in ways that traditional religion has not.      Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institutewww.core-edge.com

I have had my Linksys router for 3 years.  I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well.  They used to have free support until just recently.  I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.My beef is with the cost of support.  3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for several minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!!  I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support so I would go elsewhere.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I went into New Moon wanting to like it, and in certain sections I will admit that I did.  Naturally I am a fan of Meyer's previous book, Twilight, and was expecting to see at least a hearty attempt to recreate the magic that Twilight spun in excess.  New Moon revolves like a flat tire; the story was trying to get somewhere, but the going was rough, uncomfortable, and by the ending all I could think of was the word "unsatisfactory".In New Moon we are tossed into a story of separated lovers, and the book makes no attempt to tone down the obvious allusions to Shakespeare.  This is Romeo and Juliet, Edward and Bella style.  It gets so heavy handed that in more than a few places Bella is actively casting herself, Edward and Jacob into prominent roles in the play, and Edward takes the suicide plot and runs with it far beyond necessary.  I appreciate the attempts by the author to explain just how deep the connection is between Bella and Edward, but the Romeo and Juliet plotline is a recycled one at best, and it quickly grows sour when layered so thickly over the narrative.  Besides Bella and Edward's love `til death or suicide drama, Jacob Black is a revitalizing breath of fresh air.  The newly inherited ability to turn into a werewolf adds Jacob in as an interesting dynamic to Bella's life (and love life) and I sincerely hope Meyer continues to play with the meaning of what Jacob is to Bella besides a second option to Edward.  It would be unfair to cast Jacob as a plainly obvious second fiddle to Edward when he has so much potential.  As far as Bella, while at first her clumsy antics were amusing they also fall flat in New Moon.  Bella's accidental ability to injure herself flies off the chart in New Moon, so much so that I found myself skimming past her new and not so ingenious ways of torturing herself for the fleeting seconds when her subconscious summons up Edward's voice in order to tell her how to not act like a clumsy fool.  There had to be a better way of passing her time without Edward.  For one: growing up would have suited Bella nicely.  She's 18, yet everyone in New Moon manages to treat her as either an invalid or an infant, either saving her from herself or actively carting, hauling, or carrying her around.  The moment Bella stands up for herself and takes care of herself will be a landmark in this book series, because she spends so much time mourning Edward's loss and so much time trying to patch Jacob into the holes Edward previously filled you must wonder when Bella can fix herself rather than relying on her male friends to figure it out for her.  By the end of the book, the nature of Bella and Edward's relationship changes little. Edward comes back, scolds Bella for having acted so insane in his absence because of course he loves her, Bella is shocked that he does indeed love her (although I thought that was already established, and if not why was he trying to commit suicide if he didn't love her?) and Edward's still immaturely gung ho on suicide, no matter Bella's say in it.  Overall, New Moon is a disappointing follow-up.  Things felt rushed and ultimately pointless, not to mention the numerous typos found in a first edition copy.  Twilight is still a wonderful story, but I can't say that I'm liking where the story is going.

This was completely useless for my baby girl. She was entirely to small for it, and she could very easily wiggle out of it. Receiving blankets work just as well and you can get two packs of 4 for the price of one of the swaddlers. You can also use the blankets for a dozen other things as well, not with the swaddler. Sorry, we didn't like this one.

I was mislead into buying the PA State tax since I work in PA and live in Maryland. The software was prompting me to buy it and turns out, I do not need to file anything to PA because of agreements between the states. Too bad the software didn't share this information until after I had wasted $39.95. If I'm lucky there will be a class action suit some day and I can get my money back. Guess it's my fault for not being better informed, but according to all the advertising hype that's why I spent the initial $59.95 for this software anyway. Oh well. Maybe there is hope with Tax Cut.

I first saw the Furminator listed as a grooming feature in an ad by a local groomer.  The ad had a link to the web site, where I learned more about the product.  I found the best price at Amazon.com.  The product works very well at removing the undercoat from my dog!  He's a mixed breed with some Australian Shepard heritage, so he's got that furry layer under his top coat.  First, I brush him out with my regular brush to get the knots out.  Then I use the Furminator to work out the inner layers.  It's amazing how much extra fur comes out!  Apply gentle pressure with even strokes, being very careful of (or avoiding) sensitive areas.  It's very easy to use.  Reduces shedding very well.  My dog's coat looks beautiful after grooming!

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

Was skeptical to spend 2 and a half hours to watch a lame, comic-book inspired, predictable, unrealistic, paper-mache-acted, and insanely overhyped film.  I'm glad I was dead wrong.  I'm not a huge movie buff, but my favorites are almost always intelligent, stylized, off-center, masterfully directed crime-dramas.  Didn't think that The Dark Knight would fit that category: It did.  Wonderfully.  Its absolutely impossible to take your eyes off the screen.  I'm not sure if it was the director's intention (although it seems clearly so), but I found myself not caring much about Batman.  I found the Joker and Harvey Dent much more memorable, interesting, multi-faceted, and empathetically flawed.  I didn't see the Joker as evil at all: Just a man answering his true calling, sometimes at the expense of a few lives and structures.  He and Dent show that time and hardship shape a person considerably more than quick gratification, wealth, and being lauded for doing "good," as Batman experiences.  While Batman is aloof and guarded, and  the Joker is extroverted, daring, and well-defined by his experiences, which he impresses upon Dent. Not sure how it made a PG-13 rating.  Even with no cursing or sexuality at all, this movie is clearly for an adult audience, with its twisting messages on morality, decision-making, and views on humanity.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who digs thought-provoking, beautifully-shot, roller-coaster films.

Sorry about the length of this, but I am absolutely livid about this book. I am angry at myself for reading the trash, but exponentially more furious at Stephenie Meyer for writing it. This book is an insult. If you are a fan of the series, over the age of 12 and/or have an IQ above 50, then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. PLEASE listen to me. Thank God I didn't spend a penny on it.Everything that made the romance between Edward and Bella so great has absolutely been destroyed. Gone are the cute, innocent teenagers who fall into an impossible romance in the cafeteria. I don't think I can ever read or watch Twilight again. I mean, I always slightly cringed when it was obvious that a modern teenager had nothing to do with any of these books. (ex. "Holy Crow?" Even my GRANDMOTHER doesn't say that.) Or the sometimes over-the-top sappy exposition and dialogue. But I could deal. But this BOOK. It was like watching my childhood stuffed animal get... um, defiled. It was that horrifying. I understand the concept of author's prerogative, but ANY author has a responsibility to 1) Keep leaps of logic to a minimum, which definitely excludes some weird, mutant child of the corn, 2) Keep the plots and characters consistent throughout the series within the framework which the author has set up, and 3) Follow basic rules of writing and editing a novel designed for an intelligent audience. All 3 of which were shockingly snubbed in Breaking Dawn. Please, please, please. Do yourself a favor and stop reading at Eclipse, or better yet, at New Moon or Twilight, and fill in the very few blanks for yourself. I will never criticize an author for having an ambiguous ending again. Just click on "Most Helpful Reviews" and you will see the many, many people who feel the same way. *SPOILERS AHEAD, but you should probably read this part anyway to realize just how awful this book is*Here are a few of the many, many problems I have with this book:1) So Edward and Bella get married and that part's pretty cute, even though I think it would have made more sense to transform her first, since that's how they're planning to spend their marriage. They get married at the very beginning of the book, and Bella doesn't even really want to. She agreed because she wants to get laid. Wow, warms the heart.Then begins the vomit-inducing 700 pages. 2) Edward and Bella have sex. A lot. Effectively ruining the innocence of their cute romance and turning it into some trashy, thinly-veiled-porn novella you buy at the airport. Sex is at the very least alluded to in almost every scene they have together. They like it. We get it.But that's not the worst part. Even while she is HUMAN. Um, Edward is a creature who literally turns iron into dust and moves as fast as a speeding car without breaking a sweat. And she wants him to have SEX with her as she is?! How the HELL would that be 1) Enjoyable for him, and 2) Not life-threatening for her?! Not only does Bella whine, manipulate, and cry her way into doing this outrageously stupid and selfish thing (totally decimated my respect for her character), but then Edward, totally out of character, gives into her crap and agrees to TRY. TRY?! Why don't I just TRY to juggle chainsaws?! And for what? So she can GET SOME a little bit ahead of schedule? She can't bear to have her first time unless she's worried about Edward breaking her in HALF?! If I was Edward, had Bella even suggested such a thing I would have first laughed myself silly, then run screaming in the other direction from such a reckless lunatic. That whole thing really pissed me off.3) Pregnant. 17-year-old vampire Edward and 18-year-old human Bella. Ew. Ew. Ew. I can accept the marriage, because Edward will never get older, and they love each other. But when I got to that part, and both of their reactions to it, I wanted to scream I was so angry. It is just so small and stupid, so out of place in the story, and CONTRIVED. Ugh! As so many other people said, I thought it was Fanfiction I was reading, not a published work, let alone from the actual author. I'm curious as to what Meyer was smoking when she thought this was an appropriate plot line. But it got worse. What suspension of disbelief I had left broke, and I became permanently removed from the story. I began to hate Bella, and resent Edward's cardboard characterization. 4) Their weird mutant spawn literally kills Bella slowly. And she couldn't be more thrilled about it. The fact that Meyer had made the ridiculously immature, but lovable and relatable teenager Bella PREGNANT was bad enough. But then it is with some weird, unknown mutant parasite, that saps all her strength, breaks several of her bones (including her SPINE) and causes various bruises, and makes her drink HUMAN BLOOD. During Bella's pregnancy, I was literally shuddering with disgust on almost every page. That is not an exaggeration. And I'm 19. No joke, I was rooting for the wolves to attack the Cullens and kill the thing. Bella and Edward's characters fly so far off their character rails that you can't even see them any more. Bella whole-heartedly embraces the thing while it slowly kills her, and Edward does nothing but hopelessly mope about it. 5) The birth and Bella's transformation. UGGGGHHHH. This was hands-down the most disturbing passage I have ever read. I had to put the book down to take some deep breaths several times out of anger and disgust, and then wrestle with myself about whether or not to keep reading multiple times on one page. My Edward and Bella. Who fell in love as lab partners, and cutely fought because of their stubborn personalities. Here, Bella, dieing and screaming in agony, vomits blood while the mutant baby inside of her destroys her body, internal organs and spine. Edward uses his teeth to bite the baby out of her uterus. Bella dies and then Edward injects vampire venom into her heart with a syringe.This is how Bella starts her new life with him. TOTAL Slap. In. The. Face. I was ready to drive to Arizona, find Stephenie Meyer's house, and burn it down.6) Renesmee. This is what Bella names their child. Ruh. Nez. May. A combination of Renee and Esme. Seriously?Seriously, Stephenie Meyer? Why didn't you just sell a book that just says, "To all my fans: F%*# YOU."When Bella tells her father that the baby's middle name is Carlie, I thought, "well, that's not so bad." Then she says that it's a combination of "Charlie" and "Carlisle." Again, I considered driving to Arizona. 7) Bella as vampire. One of the things that made this series so great was how seemingly-impossible and different the relationship with her and Edward was. She literally had to give up her humanity, her family, and her whole life, in order to have a future with him, but she decided that the love of her life was worth it. It's a difficult, heart-breaking choice and I really liked that. But no. All of a sudden, Bella has it all. She is infinitely more beautiful, graceful, powerful, inexplicably becomes supermom at 18, and still retains all the parts of her humanity she was afraid to lose. She has a child, she stays in Forks, and tells her family. There are mentions of her carrying wads of five thousand dollars like it was chump change, which is BEYOND out of character. Waiters "gasp" at her beauty. She also becomes sickeningly vain. Then they run off to a little storybook cottage her new family has just given her for free, and Edward and Bella "make love" in it like rabbits every chance they get. If Bella had any relatability left, especially for teenagers, she lost it. This also applies to the believability of the story as a whole and the complexity of the Twilight characters.8) Jacob and Renesmee. Jacob, the cute and friendly guy (but also rapist-in-training in Eclipse) who is painfully in love with and loyal to Bella, imprints (falls in love with) on her newborn BABY. This is beyond sick and pedophilic. But it's ok. He's willing to "share" the baby with Bella and Edward. Bella and Edward quickly realize this whole thing is great. WHAT the F#*%?!If it weren't bad enough that this annoyingly perfect child that absolutely everyone in the book ADORES exists, she is destined to be with JACOB. At the end of the book, Edward calls Jacob SON. I just shuddered again WRITING that. 9) The climax, or lack thereof.After several stupid and pointless pages, and GIANT letdowns with weak plotlines about secret messages and hidden motives that go nowhere, nothing happens. Bella puts up her magical, super-scary mental shield around everyone and all of a sudden the infinitely powerful and wizened vampire royalty runs away, peeing their pants. In conclusion, Breaking Down is not only literary trash that should have returned from the editor's office soaked in red ink, but it also completely destroys the story as a whole. It makes me sick to my stomach what this book did to Edward and Bella in my mind and everyone else's. I will never read a single page of this absolute rubbish again, and hopefully I'll forget about it in a few years. I pray this book will never make it into theaters. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.

What to say about BD?  I did not like the book as much as the first three.  My daughter (15) recommended it since  of her school mates were reading it.  She knew I was searching for a book that would catch my interest.  I read Twilight in two days and it left me wanting more, thus I checked out  New Moon at the library.  Again I craved for more; then I moved to Eclipse.  Breaking Dawn was a disappointment.  I like the fact that the major characters got a happy ending, but where is the fight the dertmination to get what you deserve? So Bella discovers that she has a gift, but where is the struggle the passion that we so in the first books? Jacob definitely got the short end of the stick.  I love the fact that he moved on but is that enough for th Jacob that we all love and care about? The editing need some help.  There are some grammatical issues that could have been avoided.

I bought this because of the reputation of the WRT54G, not realizing that v5 of the hardware is completely different from the older versions and doesn't run Linux. Even with the latest firmware, it is consistently unstable and will lock up and stop functioning every few days. I'd advise voting with your wallet and staying away from the WRT54G v5, and thinking about a WRT54GL which is the "classic" version of the hardware that runs Linux. Unfortunately, this seems to be more limited in availability than the cut-down version.

I purchased this unit in November 2007. It is now December of the same year and the "hold" button will not release after it has been depressed until I turn the unit off. So now when my mouth fills with water, I have to turn the unit off to stop the stream of water, expel the water from my mouth, turn the unit back on and continue in this fashion until finished. The other problem I've noticed is the pressure starts out very weak and usually doesn't build until the water in the tank is about half gone.I expected more from the Waterpik Ultra, but based on it's performance thus far, I would not recommend it.

Please feel free to leave a comment of this review & I will respond to it (well if it's interlectual of course)Before I start the review I'm just gonna give each episode a grade with 1 being the lowest & 5 the highest.Bizzaro 5Kara 5Fierce 1Cure 1Action 1Lara 2Wrath 2Blue 2Gemini 2Persona 3Siren 1Fracture 1Hero 1Traveler 4 1/2Veritas 5Descent 3Sleeper 1Apocolypse 3Quest 1Arctic 1or that's5x34 1/2 x13x32x41x9Season Average= 2.275OK to begin with this season was better than Season 6 (but just) what let it down big time though was the way the season ended & it has to go down as not only Smallville's worst ever season finales but one of the worst in television ever, but more on that later.First with the good. There were new characters & mini arcs this season that were actually to do with the mithos & although some worked (Veritas, Bizzaro, BRAINiac) others didn't (Laura-Zor-El). Although the worst of them has to be the Julian clone plot which rightfully was finished as soon as it started & was never mentioned by anyone again (Even Lois eventhough he was her ex-boyfriend?)What really dragged this season down was the unnecessary soap opera romance rubbish the obvious Clark/Lana. I was actually looking forward to an actual honest to God talk between these two characters this season but all be learned was that Lana has the personality of a cardboard cutout & Clark is an idiot & that wasn't something we already didn't know.But worse of all (yes worser than Clana) was the Jimmy & Chloe relationship that's basically been forced upon us so much that I'm actually starting to hate Jimmy with the same verocity as I do Lana. And if you want to see how easy it is to hate Jimmy just check out Sleeper cos that is what the title says.But unlike Season 6 which was mainly Soap Opera rubbish, Season 7 at least as I stated earlier tried to offer some alternatives but these were either poorly executed (Laura, Zor-El) stupid (Lex gets shot in the head & survives via a device that you'd also see on the cartoon Superfriends) and dissapointing (Brainiac, it admittingly had its moments but at the end crashed to a dissapointing end, but more on that later).The Season did start of well though Bizzaro & Kara were excellent episodes but Kara the character herself didn't really serve no real purpose to the show alot of the time except for looking nice & the next few were just riducilous & pointless episodes about this fact. Although she was awesome when she came back in Traveller.Jor-El is still an a-hole & freezes Clark for no real reason before Bizzaro comes back makes love to Lana dies in the most stupid way before we get for a change some decent drama from Clark & Lana although a few episodes later they are all lovey dovey, until...VERITASThis is one of the best episodes of this season & one of Smallville's best for ages. It follows on from the excellent Traveller episode where we learn than Lionel & a few others knew of Clark's arrival & years before he landed on Earth were waiting for him. This episodes makes some compelling discoveries about characters & motivations, especially Lionel & I'll admit the episode he dies in Descent although dissapointing wasn't bad at all but this was enough to actually convince that after 3 & a half years Smallville was back on track but low & behold... THE ENDINGDiscluding Apocolypse which was an ok episode but still had nothing to do with anything except false forshadowing & fan service. The episodes Sleeper, Quest & Arctic have to go down as some of the worst Smallville episodes ever.First there's Sleeper, which I've already explained earlier, then there's Quest where Robert Picardo of Star Trek Voyager fame plays Jason Teague who for some reason wants to kill Clark cos he didn't kill Lex even though Clark according to him is our last hope??? Oh whatever.But then there's Arctic which wraps up all the great stuff that was started off in the Traveller, Veritas & Descent trilogy in one of the most ugliest & terrible yet stupid ways possible. I was most tempted to cut those 3 earlier episodes grades just cos of the mess it caused but making these out to not be great because of some hack writers (Strike or no Strike) just wouldn't be fair.

I bought this product yesterday and it was supposed to install in 10 minutes   but it took over three hours calling the tech support and talking with someone who could hardly speak English!. I am very dissatisfied with this product because instead of automatically being installed I had to change all the IP Address, Sub Net etc manually. I think a $20 router would do better. I also had an older version of D-Link that stopped working within 6 months. So I am all done with D-Link and would never even look at their products.

H&R Block's "TaxCut Home and Business" has been a great choice for me for several years, and each year they improve the product.  I ordered the 2008 version today.This package is remarkable.  It includes software for your Form 1040 individual or joint tax return, plus programs to prepare your Corporation or S-Corp (Form 1120), Partnership (Form 1065), or Estate or Trust (Form 1041).  State returns for all these is included.  Employment tax return preparation (W-4, 1099 and so on) is also included.For the personal return, electronic filing for federal is included (5 returns), but you will have to either mail your state return or pay a fee (reasonable by my lights) to file electronically.  I don't think electronic filing is available for the business returns.Anyway all this is in the package.  Don't overbuy.  If you don't have one of the businesses mentioned, just get the appropriate software for 1040 returns.  But if you need to file for a business (Corp/Partn/EstTr) plus your individual return, this deal is hard to beat.Let me end with a few cautions:If you are buying "TaxCut Home and Business + E-file,"  you don't need to buy "TaxCut Premium + State + E-file."  IT'S INCLUDED.  I mention this specifically because they seem to be marketed together on this site.The forms to be used for this year's income tax haven't been completed by IRS.  They will be updating items during the first couple of months of 2009, and there's no way the software I'm buying today can include all of them.  So I'll need to go to the HRBlock update site a few times (the software connects and links up) to get updates from both Fed and state.With all tax software there is a learning curve, so "read the lines," think about what you're doing, allow adequate prep time, and review the results before you file.  I think you'll be pleased.PS - I used to work for H&R Block but have not for several years.  I use the software because I think it's the best for the price.

Well, the first two weeks were fine but now internet connection is extremely slow via both wireless and ethernet and iTunes streams keep rebuffering(cutting out) every 5 seconds making iTunes streams unlistenable.When connecting my computer directly to my cable modem, internet is fast and ITunes is fine (no rebuffering). Just tried connecting a friend's old Netgear router to my computer and cable modem and both internet connection and iTunes streams are fine. So the problem has gotta be with this Linksys WRT54GL router. It's obviously gone bad.What a bummer!  I'm returning this and will look for a  better quality,  more reliable router. I previously used a Linksys WRT54G that belonged to a house mate and had constant connection drop offs so when I read the 4 and 5 star reviews for the WRT54GL I expected router nirvana but, alas, no joy. How disappointing.

This product is very good and recommended to any dog owner. Works great on short-hair coats, WOW. I never realized how much undercoat a short-haired dog has.

I had a hand mixer that probably qualified to be almost an antique! When it was time to put that one to rest, I chose this model above the others available. It is a sturdy mixer with a range of several speeds from which to choose. The attachments are easily secured to the mixer. Ergonomically, it is comfortable to hold while mixing. Clean-up is easy as the attachements pop out; the exterior of the mixer is also easy to wipe clean. Great gift for others or for yourself!

I went to get Turbo Tax Deluxe today and fortunately did not have the money with me.  I by chance read all these comments online about all these hidden fees and I am appalled.  I have been using TurboTax since 1993 and love the program, but I'll be damned if I have to pay extra for doing family and friends returns.  It's totally unacceptable.  Thank you all for your very helpful feedback and for warning the public about this ridiculous showing of greed.  Bye Bye Turbo Tax.

TurboTax has gone to another new low.  They tried to sneak in an additional charge per tax return.  Didn't they learn anything back in 2003 when they tried to limit printing to one computer?Yes, they have now deleted the extra charges.  But how can we ever trust them again?  I am used to just ordering the software I need from Intuit.  This year I had already ordered it before I knew anything about the controversy over the extra charges.  Plus, they raised the price.I have also ordered TaxCut Home and Business, which I understand will do the same thing as TurboTax Home and Business, PLUS, TurboTax Business.  This is a savings of around $170, including state.  I do not believe TaxCut is as robust and comprehensive as TurboTax, but I am willing to give up some things in order to do business with a company I can trust in the future.  Plus, a $170 savings in this economy is pretty substantial...I'll use both company's software and decide whose I'll use next year.   But I can easily see saying a final goodbye to TurboTax!

How was the producer ever able to secure the participation of so many competing self-help product-peddling marketers and bring them together under one superstore roof called "The Secret"?What a line-up of "teachers." Joe Vitale, "metaphysician." Michael Beckwith, "visionary."  John Demartini and Bob Proctor, "philosophers." These titles appear to be misnomers when you check out their actual credentials. Their Web sites make them seem like ... well, something less than spiritual teachers. At the affiliated online superstore -- dear God! (and, yes, the link is "Secret Superstore") -- one can buy genie lamps and gratitude rocks [note to self: start selling stones from driveway]. Did I miss the Burger King tie-in?  How dare they abuse the good names of the Buddha, Emerson, etc., in this grotesqueness. I don't disagree with the idea of the "Laws of Attraction." That's old stuff. However, this particular application is the very definition of crassness.

First of all let me say that I brought this EEEPC 2GB for writing purposes as I am a writer and I wanted something small to carry around instead of carrying my bigger laptop everywhere. I love the size, and I brought outside storage for it to be able to carry info to both my main laptop and this one. My complaint is that it won't get on the internet, which in my case it is not really that big of a deal for what I want to use it for, but if you are buying a EEEPC FOR INTERNET, I would say this is not the one to buy. After purchase I tried to contact the company for support, not very supportive nor seem to stand behind the product, getting through to a live person is extremely hard and may take a few hours and several attempts. Still won't get me on the internet.I felt it important to notify others who may be thinking of purchasing one of these little seemingly dream machines simply to let others know of this situation.If you don't care about the internet then it is a dream to take along for writing like I do. Very portable and easy to access the programs in the PC which is Open Office, very easy to use so simple even a child can use it. As for me I will use it for what I brought it for, but will be looking for something better so that I can write and also have the internet if I desire.

Out of the box the drive was very slow (1.6 GB/30 min.!) in Windows 2000. E-mail support from Western Digital was useless. But, under Ubuntu 8.10 the drive is fast and operated flawlessly right out of the box. I'm very happy with this drive and would have rated it a 5 except for the poor, poor e-mail support from WD.The only other thing to note is the short USB cable (22") so if your USB port is in the back beware. This apparently is a property of USB 2 not this drive in particular.

So when my HP laptop broke down, I wanted to find a new computer that would be affordable but functional. That's when I discovered the netbook genre. With so many brands out there, Asus's Eee Pc, Acer's Aspire one, MSI's Wind, HP's Atom, the list goes on, it can get a bit confusing. But at the end of the day, all of these netbooks are similar, if not exactly the same when it comes down to the technical specifications (screen size, processor, hard drive, wireless card, software, etc).But there are several features that set this netbook apart. First, the Samsung NC-10 came out on top with its 6 cell battery (many other netbooks only have a 3 cell), which equals a MINIMUM of 4.5 hours, and easily over 7 hours when in its power saving mode. Also, this model has a 160GB hard drive, leaps and bounds over what many other netbooks offer. And, in another great stride, if you want to increase the RAM (from 1gb to 2gb), Samsung did a brilliant job making the RAM so accessible. It's as simple as removing a screw from a panel on the bottom of the computer that says "Memory", removing the panel, and switching out the memory aka RAM. The function keys are very useful, for everything from volume, screen resolution, power mode, wireless networking, external screen options, and more, making using this computer a genuinely fun experience. I had Vista running on my old laptop, and even though I have not upgraded the RAM, this thing runs effortlessly with the XP provided. If you are worried about Windows XP, don't be, because I have transferred every single application that I had with Vista to this computer, and have lost zero performance. It even has a slot to insert SD memory cards (unfortunately not for memory sticks).Now, nothing is perfect. First of all, I have medium sized hands, and though the keyboard works great for touch typing, there isn't much space between the start of the keyboard and the end of the computer to rest your wrists on, which can strain yours hands after a while. Purchasing a wrist pad will help. Also, one drawback of having one of the roomiest keyboards on the netbook market (95% full size) means this has a smaller touch pad. It's very reactive and has the same pinch/stretch properties that apple touchpads have, but it still takes some getting used to. Also, I got this in blue, and the top is a fingerprint magnet. And if you plan on playing music from your netbook, be sure to get external speakers, because these speakers are by far the worst thing about it, with a generic tinny sound to them. If I had to go back and do it again, I would definitely buy this computer again. Of course, in the world of technology, things constantly change, so in about a year I may have my eyes on a Vista or Windows 7 netbook, but for now I'm very happy with this purchase.

This is probably a fine wireless router for those who use Windows, but it REALLY doesn't work well with Mac OS X, especially the Mac laptops  (though apparently it does work somewhat for some Mac people). There is a lot more detail in the how-to article posted here, and especially in the comments section after: [...]I tried all the tricks in that article but had no luck with mine, so I wound up returning it.  Fortunately, Amazon's service in that regard is excellent. I understand this router used to use a more open and flexible Linux system, but has since changed to something else. But Linksys really should specify that this product simply wasn't designed to work well with the Mac. From the manual and the CD you would think Windows was the only OS on the market! Also, IMO, as Linksys made a good reputation for how "hackable" the original was, they should have changed the model number when they removed the original functionality. This is probably a classic example of a big company "coasting" on the previous product's reputation. Rather sad.

Just packed up my second one to be returned. I never even got to the point of making coffee. Both units leaked water out of the main tank, and not just a little. The first one leaked so bad that I had several  cups of water on the counter before I dumped it back out and this was while I was trying to put coffee in the filter. Don't waste your time.

I ordered the 5# tub of Optimum Whey protein powder along with some books.  The box they shipped my order in was crushed and the tub cracked in a small crease.  I'm not sure if the crushing occurred at Amazon or the shipper but I really think it should have been packed better by Amazon.

I bought both the spray and the difusers with refills -the difusers I swear are water in a bottle and the spray doesnt do anything either- I have one cat that keeps peeing on top of the dryer of all places- I am constantly cleaning it up- I scrubbed it took the whole back off and sprayed the entire dryer with this to keep the cat away- she jumped up within 20 minutes and PEED on it!!!!This was either a very bad batch or just a total rip off......

This electric crepe pan was very easy to use and clean.  It is fairly lightweight and once you get the method on how to correctly and evenly apply the batter you can easily and quickly bake fresh crepes to serve with your favorite filling/topping.

This is just for the record, and to prepare you for a disappointment if you have my bad luck.  My first Panasonic breadmaker gave me about 12 years of good service and just slowly died of old age; I had no complaints.  I was just sorry to see it go.  I bought this new model breadmaker (SD-YD250) last December (2005). It has been producing SUPERB bread (about two a week, wheat or cinnamon-raisin).  I have been immensely pleased with this machine.  But now it has just suddenly failed.  The manual is useless when it comes to trouble-shooting, and the website is a gigantic run-around: I think there is no help at all for Panasonic breadmakers on the Panasonic web site, though it takes some time to find this fact out.  But now I am getting quite a run-around trying to get some action on the warranty.  I am disappointed with Panasonic. I had thought they were a better company.  It could be that I am just a very unlucky person, but I thought I would put my experience on record.... (Panasonic automatically sends me to a repair facility which says it does not repair breadmakers, and also says I should contact Panasonic....I am locked in a loop!)

Wow, this really does get rid of kitty hair! And I do believe that my older cat is shedding a little bit less than she used to. I can almost make a new kitty by the time I'm done combing my older kitty. And it removes the hair that's at the 'root' as it explains in the papers that came with it. I do think you have to be careful to not get carried away though. I think I read something like it could cause skin irritation if it's used for too long at one time (if your cat lets you, that is). My cat doesn't like this brush quite as much as the last brush but she still comes when she sees me holding it (she just doesn't stay around for as long so I may have to walk after her while brushing her if I don't think she's gotten a good enough grooming). But her coat feels and looks SO much better after each brushing (it almost seems like she feels better too). And I don't have to brush as often as I did with the other brush.

Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar This was the third Premier Gentle Spray Anti-Bark Dog Collar in less than two years for a vocal miniature schnauzer. It is very effective, but the collars don't last very long. The first one lasted about six months before dying. The second lasted a few months before the internal reservoir sprang a leak. The third one was defective when we received it. Fortunately, simply wearing the broken collar has some residual effect on reducing barking.

This is really full blown notebook.I was expecting a good netbook, but I was surprised by the build quality and performance of this little machine.I ended up using this machine more than the regular notebook I have, as most of the time I'm just checking my mails or doing some simple search.There are 2 things that could be better.One is the screen size. Even if it's a small netbook, I feel like they could have used more space for the screen, as it has some thick plastic borders around the screen.The second one, is that adding more RAM is pretty difficult, and you can only upgrade to 1.5 GB of RAM, seriously reducing the life cycle of the computer.But anyhow, this is a great product, and I'm satisfied by the purchase. Recommendable.

I'm running Windows XP, and I can't install it either.  Spoke with technical support, which doesn't cost you anything for the first time that you call them (so better not have any more problems after this).  They weren't able to figure out what the problem was either.  They said they would get back to me.  Now, I'll throw out the caveat that I don't know if this is a problem with the software or my computer.  But, I haven't had any significant problems with my computer in a couple of years, so I'm tempted to say it's the program.  Perhaps they released this version a bit too early without working out all of the bugs.

The pros:1) Can be used in your pocket, and works at most angles -- a big improvement over most pedometers.2) I like that it keeps a separate subset count for aerobic steps.  On the main screen it shows total steps, but if you press mode, it shows the subset count of aerobic steps you have taken (if any).  Whenever you have maintained a pace of at least 60 steps per minute (very slow walk) for 10 minutes, it counts all those steps as aerobic steps.3) Built in clock4) Automatically resets itself at midnight5) Keeps a 7 day history.The cons:After about a year, something must have broken inside because it would sporadically stop counting any steps.  Because of this, I had to purchase a new one.

Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Home & Student EditionThis product is not ready for prime time. How can they take a product that was functional a decade ago and mess it up.The registration process doesn't recognize the product ID number. Word has a default save to a .docx formate which is not compatible with earlier versions. It doesn't seem to do anything better than previous versions, even its announced features are window dressing. Word still can't speak text.Entourage's search through the address book is buggie. Its display contains a line for each day that an email was received -  adding needless clutter and taking useful space.The program introduced a bug with the keychain in my Mac operating system.

I absolutely love this fountain. I have a small mixed breed dog (25lb), a Shetland Sheepdog, and 2 large cats. I used to have 2 Vanness 3 liter automatic waterers. The water that I filled with them would sit for a week or longer and never be less than half full. After about6 months, I got tired of how hard they were to clean and that the animals did not want to drink out them. So I splurged and bought this. I really love this thing. My pets love it also. They drink it all to the point of me refilling it about twice a week. They are drinking so much water now. Which I don't mind because they need it. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to clean the entire unit and it is very easy to do. My only complaint is that I wish they made a bigger unit. I got the Jumbo, but still I wish they made a larger one. Everything else about this product is excellent.

This review is from: The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

   It is kind of funny when you read what people have to say about this movie.  Like anything else in pop-culture, for every ten people who love it there are ten more who think it's terrible, or boring, or too violent.   The movie is not terrible.  It is fast-paced and entertaining.  Nolan starts with a number of threads at the beginning and brings them all together by the mid-point of the picture.   "The Dark Knight" is faster paced than "Batman Begins" but that is to be expected because with any good comic-book or superhero adaptation...the first movie should always be about the backstory or how Batman came to be Batman.  Sometimes it is done well like in "Iron Man" or "Batman Begins" and sometimes you get "The Fantastic Four"   These movies are almost like the James Bond movies in that the movie is only as good as its villian.  In this regard it is Heath Ledger that takes this movie the extra mile.  Many in here have said that if he didn't die soon afterwords there would have been no big deal over his performance...that could not be more untrue.  His performance has nothing to do with his death.  He delivered the most chillingly real picture of evil on the screen since Hopkins in "The Silence of the Lambs."  The performance was picture perfect, from the designer suits, to the unkept hair, to the tick of sticking out his tongue like a serpent.   Helping balance the chaos on that side are real grounded performances from Christian Bale and Gary Olman (I defy anyone to find a movie in which he gived a subpar performance!)   The special effects are fantastic, but they never become a crutch for Nolan because at its heart this is a character study.  Some would probably have liked 2+ hours of mayhem, but those are probably the same people who hated "3:10 to Yuma" because there were not enough shoot-outs.  These movies are about the men behind the action, not the action itself.   I am dissappointed by the lack of features.  If a company is going to market a special edition and charge you more for it, it should be bursting with extra stuff...but in the end, you buy the movie for the movie.

I was hoping to have a back-up to show my kids about the wonders of this planet, an overview, without hearing the same pathetic comments about the "endangered species". Dinasours are extinct because of natural selection, so are the actual life beings. Illegal hunting for instance, that is important to mention, a real fact.

I purchased the Fuze after doing lots of research. After receiving it promptly from an Amazon merchant(bzseller), I charged it. Started playing with its features, and while saving a voice recording, it crashed (white screen). Called Sansa support (very helpful), which instructed me to reset. Crashed a second time. Reset. Tried to update firmware, but got error message.  Tried to encode video from different sources (DVD,MP4,AVI) using bundled Media Manager, which locked up on two separate computers, requiring reboots.I gave it one star because the radio worked fine, and when it was functional, audio(mp3,wma) quality was high. I returned it to the merchant (no hassles;full refund), then purchased a Sony Walkman NWZ-E436F. A little more expensive(4GBSony vs 2GBFuze)but problem free, great sound, and crisp seamless video playback using SUPER encoder set at VIDEO mp4;H.264/AVC;320:240;384kbps and AUDIO 44.1K;96kbps. For DVDs,use DVD Decrypter or Smartripper and deselect all audio language streams except English). The Sansa did not recognize files encoded using many different variations of audio/video settings.

Have purchased 3 Flip cameras and love the ease of taking videos.  The software that comes with them is proprietary and does not work on other video editing programs. This is a shame because it perfoms only around 50% of its simplistic function of stitching the clips together.  Then I purchased a new Ultra model. Picture taking is better but the software is now unusable.  I am stuck with a camera full of clips that I cannot download to my computer. There tech support (emial only) has abandoned me.  Do not buy an Ultra model.

crashes on a daily basis, sometimes half a dozen times an hour.  tried turning off all the automatic channel selection and other complexities, which reduced the crash rate to a couple a day.  still unacceptable garbage, especially for $300.  i have since ordered a dual-band from netgear for 1/3rd the price and i will never buy a linksys product again.  beware if you entertain thoughts of upgrading it to dd-wrt firmware that this model has an un-upgradable firmware version installed on it (search on 600n unable to upgrade on the dd-wrt website) so you won't be able to.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT (or anything by linksys) unless you want to get ripped off.

This camcorder makes me sick! I got it in october and used it for a few weeks and it worked well. But three weeks after ive been using it it started to get these gray bars across the screen so I contacted sony(there tech support is a joke they should be ashamed!)and sony said to reset it so I reset it and it didn't work so I contacted sony again and they said that it was a faulty camera. So I sent it back and I got a new one.You won't believe this! It started having the same problem so I called sony AGAIN and they told me absolute rubbish an didn't even tell me anything I could do to fix it!!!! So this time I took it back to the store and bought a JVC Everio GZ-MG330 and it is better than this piece of garbage by a long shot! In my opinion if you want a camera that doesn't last long and even if you take it back and get a new one and it still breaks this piece of trash is for you! p.s I used to be a sony fan but this awful piece of trash and their HORENDOUS costomer service made me change my mind. I am no longer a sony fan.

The juicer looks good but that is about it. I was in a hurry when I purchased it but I wished I would have heeded the advice from the bad reviews for this juicer and purchased from a different manufacturer. I've only used it a dozen times and the rim cover broke off - it was glued on to the housing. The machine is poorly built: plastic coating is peeling off; parts are cracking and falling apart - it is all plastic; the motor is very touchy- it shuts down in the middle of the cycle and you have to take it apart to start it up again. Avoid this juicer or you will me very disappointed like I have been. I feel like it going to break down any time even though I have pampered it like a baby. I love drinking fresh juices so I am prepared to spend more money and purchase a better quality juicer. There are much better made juicers on the market!

...but this device did not hold up for one day against my 9 year old, 20 lbs soaking wet Sheltie.  I came home to discover she had knocked it around quite a bit so that the top part had come off, the food was eaten and the plastic cover over the control panel had been chewed.  Perhaps the two stars should be assigned to my food crazed pet, but she's not exactly a junk yard dog. Programming the device was also very challenging and I'm almost always fine with that sort of thing. The instructions were poorly written and the steps counter-intuitive.  The feeder did seem to work just fine when I did a trial run at dinner the night before leaving it alone with the dog while I was at work.  As I said, this might work very well for cats.  It simply isn't sturdy enough for many dogs, even of the smallish variety.

I was so excited to get the third book since I loved the first book and the second one even more. But Eclipse was hard for me, I think because it seemed some things seemed drug out and contrived a bit. So I couldn't stay as engaged as I previously had...I found myself getting a little annoyed. There were still some great parts and it was in this book in particular I came to love the Cullen family and felt the author really helped explain them best. I always felt any references to Bella's mother was an after thought especially when it came to bigger things in the 4th book. This is was my least favorite of the series. Still a good read, but I didn't think it was nearly as good as the first two.

The large FURminator is an absolute miracle for anyone with a German Shepherd (and a German Shepherd mix who inherited the undercoat).  While I can't explain how it so gently removes the thick undercoat without pulling at the outer coat, I can say it's already saved me hours of grooming and it's done an exponentially more effetive job than I ever could with any of the other dozen or so tools I've tried.  Although I'm probably going to have to come up with some other form of upper body workout to replace the long aerobic brushings I used to force upon my dogs, there are a lot fewer furballs rolling across the tile and both dogs come running when I pick it up so it's making everyone happy.

Bought this (Omron HJ-112 Digital Pedometer) as a replacement for the same model that had just worn out after five years of intensive use.  The older one was performing erratically.  Wouldn't keep the aerobic steps consistently, i.e., would stop counting aerobic steps even though I had not stopped aerobic walking.  The new pedometer has many of the problems as the older one, including some new ones. In the first two days, it failed to account for 25 minutes of aerobic walking.  It still does that occasionally. Most frustrating is that it will stop counting aerobic steps even when one has been walking and continues to walk aerobically.  You can walk for 35 or 40 minutes, continue walking and not have any of that counted.  It may or may not resume after another 10 minutes or so, but you almost certainly will have "lost" anywhere from 2 to 25 minutes of aerobic walking.  I've now noted when I start aerobic walking and when I stop and have noticed that the discrepancy is anywhere from 5 to 25 minutes between what the pedometer has and what I know I've walked.  Seems to be a quality control issue, and that the pedometer is faulty. I've waited too long to return to Amazon, but it's still under warranty and I can return it to Omron for replacement, although I'm not sure that's what I want to do.  Could be replacing it with another pedometer just as erratic as this one is.Buyer beware. If you get it and have the same issues, return to Amazon immediately. And look for another pedometer.

It's not bad.I can watch on another PC on the same network (hooked up to a TV) and it looks lightly better than SD TV, not quite HD.  On my laptop when I'm on the road, it's choppy.  That may be the connection, because I use an old Xbox wireless adapter to connect it to my network.When you click the remote, it's like you fast forward time for a second.  You have to get used to it.  But if you leave it alone and just watch the TV, it's pretty good.My friend even used it to watch a UFC PPV at his house using a giant projector on his wall, and said it was very good.

There are excellent instructions to install the router; however, the guidance on how to go "wireless" is incompete at best.  After 4 hours trying to get the wireless feature to work (which involves switching back from the awful instruction book to the less than helpful website where the router must be configured) I spent 2 hours being yelled at by a custmer service rep who failed to mention that I needed to key in a passcode from the bottom of the router.

If I had not known that this was directed by Woody Allen, I would have quickly come to that conclusion because every person with more than one line of dialogue walked, talked, gestured, and whined their way through the entire movie. I am constantly amazed at how leading talent will consent to be part of such poor stories. I suppose that performers only make money when they are performing. No matter how well they play their parts, they are all too often  remembered as participants of waste in time, money, film, and the potential  to have accepted a more worthwhile role and film.

You can get a better sounding headset for the money you spent on this one, trust me. I have an older model HP headset and I have yet to find a headset that can match the sound quality.

Update 8/22/08 - This mixer still works beautifully.  While I don't make bread daily, I do make pizza dough almost weekly and I love this mixer.  It also whips cream better (because of the flatter bowl bottom design) than my slightly smaller, older KitchenAid.  I'm still thrilled with this product and Amazon.com.....(Previous Review) Like the reviewer, "Cats Rule", I, too, have an old workhorse KitchenAid mixer that is about twenty-five years old and has only needed one repair throughout all of those years and hundreds of cookies and cakes.  I will never let "Old Reliable" go (I had withdrawal symptoms when I had to send it to KitchenAid for the repair which took a month) but I also wanted a larger capacity mixer.  I purchased this one from Amazon.com a couple of weeks ago and so far it has been fabulous.  For the first time in my life I made pizza dough, three batches in two weeks, using the KitchenAid recipe, at the recommended speed of 2, and both the mixer and pizza dough are great.  I did find another recipe that differed only in the amount of olive oil used (1 Tablespoon vs the KitchenAid 1 tsp) which worked even better for us (slightly less crisp crust and works beautifully with the dough hook).  I found that if I use too much flour and/or too little olive oil, the mixer did vibrate a tiny bit but still kept mixing.  One really great difference between the older, five quart mixer and this new, larger one is the shape of the bowl.  The 600 Series has a slightly flatter bowl which allows better mixing without having to use a spatula at frequent intervals to incorporate the batter at the bottom of the bowl.  I read all of the reviews before purchasing this mixer, which really helps, and I am looking for any sign of the gear box breaking (we haven't taken it apart yet to see if we have a metal or plastic box). I did speak to KitchenAid before I made this investment and they said they would replace the gear box with a metal one if mine should have a problem.  I intend to keep making bread or pizza dough each week, and larger batches of cookies during this first year - not only to test the mixer, but because the mixer works so well, so far, and there are so many fantastic cookie, cake, bread and pizza recipes out there!  My husband (voluntarily) said that he would rather have our pizzas than any other he's ever tasted, and we can choose healthier alternatives by making our own - like canadian bacon or turkey, Italian sausage pizzas.  I have noticed a difference in sound when mixing pumpkin pie ingredients, but that might be normal (and I might be overly concerned about the gear box).  KitchenAid documented my concern, at my request, in case I should have a bigger problem down the road.  I might also take an idea from "Cats Rule" and purchase a few other attachments from Amazon.com.  I am thrilled with my KitchenAid mixer, the KitchenAid company, and always with Amazon.com!

This movie was really great. I think everyone should read the books first, only because the books are incredible, not because you have to read the books in order to understand the movie. That's all there really is to say really. Don't waist your time reading reviews, just buy the movie and enjoy.

I purchased the CTL 2 go pc and it wouldn't boot to the operating system ( Windows XP ) When I called CTL I was transferred to a guy names John who identified himself as the 2go project manger. When I asked him if he could help me he was rude and aggressive and told me he didn't have the time to answer my questions and transferred me to the technical repair line. I then spoke to a guy who sounded Eastern European and he told me he wasn't in charge of repairing 2go pcs and then he transferred me to a guy named Jason. I got Jasons voicemail and left a message with my name, number and email address. 2 weeks later, no reply. I called again and asked to speak to the manager and was transferred to the voicemail of a guy named Eric Stronqist who is the guy in charge of CTL. Again I left my info, again no reply. Companies like these will be the first to go in this economic downturn and they deserve all they get.

Simply put, this product fails to do what it's supposed to do.Even plugged in, it still does not seem to draw enough power to supply more than three plugged items reliably.  I had a keyboard, dongle, MIDI interface and USB DAW controller plugged in, and each time I restarted my computer, a different item would be unrecognized.I tried tech support, and they were useless.  Furthermore, they HUNG UP ON ME.  Twice.Finally a 'senior tech' issued an RMA for me to replace it, but I wasn't about to spend $10 to ship them a $30 unit, only to have it replaced with an IDENTICAL unit that probably wouldn't work as well.  (There are plenty of other bad reviews here to corroborate my suspicions.)I emailed customer support asking for a refund, but they simply chose to ignore my emails.  I even told them that I would be posting my bad experience here, but apparently they decided that they would rather have the bad publicity than issue a $30 refund.  Tells you something about the company, doesn't it?

I would love to be able to stop using MS Office. Unfortunately, collaboration at work requires that I use Word 2008. Word 2008 is completely incompatible with one of the features of OS 10.5 that I use the most frequently, Spaces.

This is the best pedometer I've owned.  I get some info from my treadmill, but wanted day long info.  This is so accurate!  It counts without fail.  The best part is being accountable using the computer software.  The computer program maintains records of not just the amount of activity but type (I love seeing the aerobic walking aligned with the hardwork I put in on the treadmill).  If you're serious about maintaining your health and keeping tabs daily...this is the product for you!

The Oral-B Triumph was an excellent purchase.  The toothbrush signals the user that it is time to move to the next section for cleaning.  This is definitely good because there may be a tendency to over brush. It also lets the use know when brushing is complete.  I think this is a good tool because I don't recall anyone telling me how much time is needed to brush each section of the mouth.  At least with this function in place I know how long to spend brushing my teeth. I have noticed that my teeth are more plaque free compared to manual brushing.

I bought this ball for my big mouthed golden retriever because he gets bored easily and I thought this might keep him entertained.  I tried showing him how to get the treats out, but all he wanted to do is take it to a corner and chew on on it.  He had a small hole chewed in it within the first ten minutes.  I have taken it away for now and will try to teach him a few more times, but if you have a large dog who is a chewer I would not recommend this toy.  I will definately not be able to leave him unattended with it.

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

So far this summer, we've got better movies than last summer. Especially animated films. Instead of a terrible CGI end last year (not counting the 2D Persepolis), we've got a good head start in March with "Horton Hears a Who!"But now, the folks at Pixar are amazing, incredible, and terrific, and they have done it again. And then you get the director of "Finding Nemo" finally finishing up "WALL-E." I became obsessed and excited over the movie ever since I saw a trailer for it. And that's the case with the Pixar films."WALL-E" is the story of the lovable robot by the name. After 700 years being all alone cleaning up the garbage that humans created ever since they became extinct, a mysterious ship comes from outer space. A lovely female robot named EVE comes to Earth. She and WALL-E soon become friends. However, EVE passes out from a plant and her system needs operation.WALL-E goes into outerspace and meets a lot of humans and robots. Things become a lot different for him as he meets a lot of ncie, new friends and robots. However, WALL-E soon makes his own time where he says that it should be time to come back to Earth.Be aware of the film's lack of dialogue. There is 40 minutes where you get barely any dialogue. However, more dialogue comes from the outer space era, mostly the humans, especially Jeff Garlin. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight did a great job playing the robots.The movie itself delivers. The story was really good and the animation was extremely brilliant. And that's the catch with Pixar's animation. Their animation looks photo realistic. I even liked how they animated Fred Williard, who plays Shelby Forthright; it looked realistically animated. As far as story is concerned, "WALL-E" follows Piar's concept between the story and the graphics."WALL-E" does have some sad scenes of him getting severly injured, but it leads to some happy endings. I loved the emotions between WALL-E and EVE. The whole concept (even though its different) reminds me of an old robot movie, "Short Circuit." But I think "WALL-E" is much better than "Robots;" I didn't really like "Robots." "WALL-E" was much better than "Finding Nemo" and the rest of the Pixar films. You actually care more for the characters and the story and that's what Pixar really focuses on."WALL-E" captures the emotions through what an animation film should be like. No other movie could have made me feel more happy than this. I laughed. I cried. I was in complete emotion through "WALL-E" and can't wait to see it again. Now, I just wonder. Will "Up" be just as good? But the bottom line is, I was with my emotions throughout "WALL-E" than I was with "Finding Nemo."

I was happy to upgrade to Office 2008 for Mac (I have a new macbook with Leopard) but its so bad I am going to reinstall the old office. Never done that before. Powerpoint is an amazing memory hog. 2G of RAM for a 40mb presentation? Get real. Word is ok except for the "new" standard, which means documents must be saved in two formats (what were they thinking?). Excel is the worst. The menu forces one to select from projects and elements galleries that are ridiculous, not useful and impossible to work around. And no more macros? Was there no beta testing? I actually paid microsoft $50 more for phone help to find hidden menus. Type "chart label" into the Help menu and get No Results Found. I could go on, but my bottom line is don't upgrade.

Our 16 month old yellow lab loves to play with empty 2 liter pop bottles.  I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles.  No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!To fill with treats,  just twist off the bottom;  couldn't be easier.  It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.  I honestly don't think the rope pull is going to last very long;  especially if you are buying this for an aggressive chewer.  However,  don't let that stop you from buying the tug-a-jug.  Even without the rope,  it's still a great and challenging toy.

It's quick, the reusable filter doesn't make your coffee taste funny, and the thermal travel mug keeps it warm longer than a regular mug if you're like me and get distracted before you remember you made some. I wait a few minutes anyway because it comes out too hot for me, but it's always preferable to have a hot drink that's too hot instead of too cold. It fixes the problem itself in a few minutes.A standard 16-oz straight-walled mug works just as well under it as the one it comes with if you have a favorite. I like to use it with a "homemade" Cafepress 16-ouncer at home, and the travel mug on my way to work. It also works fine to heat up tea or cocoa water for other members of the house.

I purchased this product to replace my broken T1, which was sufficient for me to capture photos and video clips for my baby's growth. After very long research, and debating on another DC or Camcorder, I picked this one based on Amazon's reviews, and more likely, hoped the 1M still shot capability would be good enough, and also utilize the hybrid feature of this machine for my just-bought 4GB MS. Unfortunately, other than the compact sze of this camcorder, nothing was really pleased me: no view finder, just-so so video quality (unless in bright light or outdoor, which I don't use that much), very poor (soft) still image, the photo button will not aid to a stable picture, no snap shot feature during taping, hybrid function does not help a lot, because the 60GB HDD is larger enough for my applications, no thumbnail available for video clips (wondering why the format is different from T1); after all, the price is too high, even for a SONY! Good parts: video clip size is small, comparing to CANON, night shot mode is sharp! and Amazon has a pretty good service system, I've got full refund and bought a CANON SD1100IS instead, and loved it so far. so maybe in the couple of year, another camcorder, but HD for sure.

Don't buy this coffeemaker if you have a cabinet above the location where you put the coffeemaker.  It is too tall to remove the grounds basket,or for that matter fill both coffee & water.  You have to pull the appliance out of it's location to do both operations.  Doesn't sound like much, but after awhile it gets to be a pain.  Makes good coffee, but definetly has design problems.

So far, I'm pleased with this purchase. One minor thing, I wish the item came with a carrying case. It is small enough to fit in my shirt pocket, but I'd have liked a case to store it in when not in use. So far, battery life is good, and video and audio quality is good. I'm not much of a "camera" guy, so I can't really speak to how it compares to other products, but I bought it to record my son's school basketball games and it works fine for that. The software it came with makes it pretty easy to copy the games to DVD.

Have owned this oven now for 2 years.  I thought the temerature control that only allows certain discrete temps would not be a problem, but it is.  Packaged items always seem to need a different temperature than you can set, and you have to decide whether to set it higher or lower, and then cook for a longer or shorter time.  This results in unacceptable results on a lot of foods.  And it seems to be that way for no other reason than to be able to call the controls "digital", without having to have a keypad and numeric display (this also goes for the timer, which works fine).

Without question the best science fiction show on the air and probably the best show on TV period. This series has some of the best production value and cinematography ever seen for a space opera. The story line and acting is pretty impressive as well. Now before I go into what I thought of season one I would like to state that many hard core fans of the original series do not like this new re-imagining of the Battlestar Galactica concept. That's fine we are all entitled to our own opinions I would just ask everyone to remember that just because something is different from the way you want it, that doesn't make it bad. I was a casual fine of the late 70's version of this show and have found the new series far more enjoyable.Now onto Season one. I'm not going to say too much but I will give you a couple highlights. The first couple episodes are slow without question (you will see a number of people who found the show "boring" because of this) and there is a little to much emphasis on the character Dr. Baltar. However the show quickly picks up and we start getting deeper into other characters such as Starbuck, Hilo (who in my opinion steals the show), Apollo and others. Make no mistake however this is a THINKING man/womans show. If you like mindless entertainment (IE: reality TV) then you will probably get "bored" or lost because you actually have to watch the show and think about what is happening (heaven forbid that things not be handed to us on a silver platter). The season ends with an excellent cliff hanger that has you chomping at the bit for season two, which to date is even better then season one. In conclusion if you are looking for an intelligent, sci-fi cinematic experience in the form of a TV show then this is it. Far superior to shows like the Star Gate series or the latest Star Trek incarnation this show takes an excellent concept and makes it great.

I almost went with Turbotax again, as we've done for the past 8 years or so. But because I wanted to do my taxes today, I went for the "Digital Download" version, and did a double-take on the price INCREASE over the CD version. That caused me to look into the reviews and see some other issues with Intuit's 2008 offering, including the icing on the cake: no State efiling included. This is pretty darn annoying to me because I think if you buy the "Deluxe" version of anything, especially if it clearly states in the name what's included, you shouldn't have to pay extra to get it. Very deceptive practice here.So, buh bye, Intuit, and hello TaxSlayer. $15, and everything's done and efiled (yes - Federal AND State).

My old computer died last week, so I was forced to buy a new one.  I got a VERY good computer - HP tower, with QUAD (not dual) processor, and 3 Gigs of RAM.  I have 2 internal drives at 1 terabyte, and 2 externals at 1 TB total.  No drive has more than 20% space used, and no other software has been installed.The biggest problem is IT'S SLOW!  When typing an email in Outlook, or a Word document (or Publisher), there is a lag between the time you hit the key and before the character prints.  It's like trying to talk with your own echo - I find myself typing MUCH more slowly than I am actually able.  I HATE THIS, and I'm not the only one with the problem.  Anyone who types for a living has the same complaint.  I've turned off all the Outlook and Word 'add-ins' as many sites recommend trying, to no avail.  A brand new QUAD Pentium with 3 GB of RAM should be able to run this turd of a program.  But no - it's so bloated with new code that the simple act that it was designed for - getting words on the screen - suffers because of it.  Just absurd, Microsoft.The 'Ribbon' interface and new file 'Save as' tree structure are WAY more cumbersome that the old toolbar.  I just want to get things done - why did they feel the need for such a massive change?  What was wrong with the old system?  I take twice as long now browsing to the folder I want.  Yes, learning new things 'takes time' - but again, EVERYONE was familiar with the standard toolbar and 'browse to file' techniques.  Why change a core skill?  Why expect a business (me) to have to spend time learning this new system?  What exactly was the point, anyway?So now I am going to have to UNINSTALL this new $279 package (what a waste) and reinstall Office 2003 just to regain my old performance.  And since my last 2003 license died with the old computer (and now cannot be uninstalled to free it up), I'll get the pleasure of dealing with Microsoft to try to recover what I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR.The software LOOKS pretty, and has TONS of new features throughout, and that part I like.  But if I can't type without looking every second to see if I got it right, and have to type at 1/3 my normal speed, how productive is that?Beware - if you type a lot with Office, you should NOT BUY THIS VERSION.I give it two stars for 'pretty' and ZERO for performance in a typing environment.

I have been entirely pleased with this pedometer. I bought one a couple of months ago after checking reviews and ratings online. It costs a bit more than other pedometers, but is well worth the price. I have found its step counts and mileage to be quite accurate after calibrating as directed. The instructions are also a bit conservative in telling you which positions will not work: I have found it to be accurate even in some of the situations that are not quite kosher according to them.I had a small problem that I needed to write to Omron about, and their response exceeded my wildest dreams in terms of speed and thoroughness.I have spoken to others who have bought other brands of pedometer and I must say that all in all, this one gives excellent value for the price, and incredible customer service.

This product delivers to what is expected. The size is a bit larger than what I expected (about 7"x 11"x 1.5"). The back up software that is included is better than most, but there's still room for improvement (ie Apple's Time Machine, where there's  little user interaction not only to back up but also to set up the back ups). All in all this is a great product; my only major complaint is that it takes several seconds to access data when the drive is turning on (waiting for the platters to rev up to speed).  But after that, the speed is great especially over firewire 800.

I decided to buy this flat iron after reading here some good reviews about it. First of all, it looked USED to me when I first opened the box. There were scratches everywhere. I'm sure it was not a new item, even though I paid for a new one. Then I tried on my dry hair and it worked fine. But since then, I have been using it after washing and blow drying my hair, when it does not work very well. I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly, but I guess it should not be a big deal. If the hair is a little bit curly, it will make it flat, but it's not the same as when you leave a hair saloon, which makes the hair so smoothly and really straight. Not sure where the magic is here. Perhaps my flat iron is already broken and I don't even know about it. Not very happy with this purchase. If someone can give me an idea of what's going on, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

I don't know how anyone didn't notice and mention this glitch in the Amazon reviews before with the Flip HD model, but you DO NOT get a full 60 minutes of recording time! First off the Flip software crashes on me so i never use it. Anyway, the Flip HD tells me on the display that i have a full 60 minutes of recording time left, but all i get is 51 minutes! My DCIM folder is 100% clear with no videos in it. On the Flip website it stated that if you are filming fast moving objects that the video file increases in size, thus giving you less recording time. Well, 2 times i pointed the camera just at my living room wall, where there is no movement whatsoever and each time i only got 51 minutes recording time! I mean i don't want to sound petty but 60 minutes is not that long to record to begin with, why should 9 minutes be missing each and every time??? The camera took nice videos but missing 9 minutes each time i used it was just to annoying, so i sent it back to Amazon. If you are just taking short videos each time i guess you will never notice this problem, but just try to record for 1 HOUR STRAIGHT and you will see what i am talking about!!!

I own three, yes three, of these gates, to reign in my gloriously active, insane 15 month old.  He rattles them, teethes on them, and slams them closed (when I forget and leave them open) -- and not one move out place, scratch, or dent on my wall.  They are all in high traffic areas, too. They open and close shut very easily and install in minutes. I was very lucky -- my first attempt at buying a gate and I found a great one on the first shot.  Highly, highly recommended.

I've spent several weeks week getting to know the Zojirushi Fresh Brew... and for the most part, I'm quite pleased. It has some foibles [which I'll get to in a moment] but on the whole it's a very capable coffee brewer. More, it's one of the very few home models I know that can brew 8 cups of just-roasted coffee at a proper 2 tablespoons per cup ratio without fuss, and - this is important! - maintain proper brewing temperatures throughout the entire brew cycle.The details...Zoji has been making vacuum pots and the like for nearly 100 years, and they've been making an assortment of rice-cookers, tea brewers and hot water dispensers for decades. While this is, I believe, their first home coffee brewer, they've got more than a little experience in kitchen electrics. They've put that experience to good use.If you've ever brewed up a thermos full of coffee using a big Melitta filter cone then this setup will look pretty familiar. For all intents and purposes, the Fresh Brew simply adds an automated hot water delivery system to the mix... with a few improvements.Improvement number one: not only does this system brew into an all-stainless thermal carafe [no hot plate here, thankyouverymuch] but it also insulates the brew basket. What good is it, after all, to heat up all that water if it's just going to get cold while you're brewing? This is huge! This is important! This is... well, I'm excited about it, okay?Improvement number two: the Fresh Brew features an accurate gauge of water volume. When it reads that you've got 8 cups of water in the brewer's reservoir, it means it. Mind you, we're talking 6 oz. cups of water -- that's the way the coffee world measures a cup [unless you're Bodum and then it's 4 oz.].Improvement number three: the Fresh Brew is patient. The biggest pain about the manual pour-over method is that you've got to wait to add more water, especially if the coffee is really fresh. Fresh coffee blooms with its charge of CO2! Faced with a full basket of coffee that was literally fresh from the roaster the Zoji didn't overflow, nor did it heave grounds into the water dispensing shower-head. More, the grounds were thoroughly saturated; no dry spots.So where's the foibles?Like a great many autodrip brewers the feeder tube that comes from the Zoji's heating element to the shower-head takes a straight path right through the water reservoir. For most brewers this is a game-over situation... the heating element simply can't overcome the heat exchange that occurs en route to the brew-head. On the Zoji, the heating element *does* get hot enough... provided that the water you've placed in the reservoir is not *too* cold.    Example A: In the office using the "unchilled" spigot on the water cooler, I draw off 48 ounces of water for the reservoir and brew a pot. Throughout the brew cycle water temperatures in the brew basket range between 195 and 200 degrees F. The result is a lovely pot of Ethiopian Yrgacheffe that is sweet, floral and lemony.    Example B: At home I draw off 48 ounces of water from the water filter in-line with the refridgerator. The temperature of the water in the reservoir is about 40 degrees F. and the resulting temperature in the brew basket never tops 185 degrees F. The result is an icky pot of the very same Yrgacheffe that is bitter, murky and flat.The moral: mind your initial water temperature and you'll do just fine.All in all, the Zojirushi Fresh Brew is capable of making 8 cups of coffee that's on a par with manual pourover methods. Better, really, as it insulates the brew-basket to better maintain water temperatures.

I purchased this item 7 months ago and it went wrong. It would not be detected by any computer. Iomega, offered to replace (but the warranty does not cover data recovery - if you want them to do that it will cost between $700 - $1200!). In addition, they do not offer free shipping back and take no responsibility if the unit gets lost. When I sent my unit back (with a tracking number) the USPS were unable to deliver for whatever reason. Therefore, I had to spend more time on the live chat trying to find out why there was nobody to take delivery. Anyway, I finally received a replacement unit today only to discover that if you buy from Amazon, you are only covered as "standard warranty" which means you get a REFURBISHED item!. Byers be aware! I actually went ahead a purchased a WD passport whilst waiting for Iomega to sort things out and I quarantee you that I will not be purchasing any Iomega items in the future!

Someone had a good idea, but the execution is poor.  We bought one of these models from a catalog 6 months ago, but after some malfunctions, we returned it for an exchange.  Unfortunately, the new unit is just as difficut to work and program.As someone mentioned, maybe your cats would have better luck getting this thing to work!  The instructions are poor and the buttons used to set the programming just don't seem to work much of the time. Quite frustrating.  When the unit works, it's good, but getting it to work correctly is most of the problem.The bottom line:  We are going to try another product.

The Pampers Swaddlers are the best. We tried every brand and even toyed around with the idea of cloth diapers, but after trying these, we haven't turned back. They are soft and absorb everything! The leg closures have two layers, a tighter inner layer and an outer layer. Neither layer pinches or marks my son's chubby legs but they keep everything where it should be - we rarely have a blow out!

I just bought this cable modem/wireless lan combo last week and it is truly a great product like everyone else has described already in Amazon's reviews. I get a strong signal and solid connection throughout my 2600 sq/ft home all the way to the bonus room on the second floor over the garage on the opposite corner from the concrete basement where the modem sits. It is also feature packed and I had no problems setting up my wireless network. Two thumbs way up!

The first time I purchased this drive I actually purchase three of them. I showed them to a couple of my friends and they fell in love with them after I would have outline a few things about them. I did not get to use mine since one of my friends had an instant need for it. He has been quite impressed with its performance. I have since bought five more of these drives and is currently using mine. They are neat beyond a doubt and are very easy to use and of course very reliable. I only have one problem: I find the shipping to be a little to high. For this I gave it 4 stars. The drive itself deserve 5 stars.

I mostly use mine to make french toast and bacon.  I like the fact that I can make an entire breakfast and only have 1 thing to clean.  I've had mine for about 3 years now and use it maybe 2-3 a month and it seems like it is cooking faster on the edges than in the middle.  I only paid $20 for mine because I got it on black friday, but overall, it's been a useful part of my kitchen.  I will probably buy another one when it goes out.

I've used virtually all the netgear products, with great success.  The WGR614 I setup for a friend, and wow, the range and speed were impressive. I got stong signals upstairs or down, front or back of the house; way better performance than from the older 802.11b-only products.  And it was a snap to setup.  This is by far one of the most refined, well documented, easy to install netgear models I've used (it looks cool too).  And the security features I configured on the wireless, very tight.  Also, no performance hit for the compression that I could measure (in 64bit mode; 128 seems like overkill to me, so i did not comare performance with 128 bit).Anyhow, an excellent product all around. As good, or slightly better than the Linksys equivalent, which I have also used. (PS: If you have broadband with no firewall, it's only a matter of time before a worm or hacker gets at you.  Buy one, seriously.)

After trying out the Logitech MX518, Logitech G5, Razer Copperhead, and Razer Deathadder, I easily sided with this mouse. This is the mouse that best fits my hand; furthermore, the material used on the side as well as the top is perfect - much more comfortable than the the surface of Logitech's mice.But to keep this objective, mice are indeed personal things, so it is fair if one does not like this mouse due to aesthetics. I recommend trying out all the mice you are thinking of getting, and see how the shape fits your hand. For my hands, this mouse is simply a flawless fit.If you purchase this mouse here, the most up-to-date drivers are installed, and there are absolutely no problems with the mouse: plug it in, install drivers from a cd, and you are ready to customize your DPI, etc to your liking.A highly recommended mouse - give it a chance and try it out at your local electronics store the next time you go - you won't be disappointed!

Buying this wireless router turned out to be the singularly most frustrating experience I've ever encountered with any product.  When -- after a good deal of difficulty and a long call with customer service -- it finally was up and running, connectivity was only intermittent.  Customer service is a nightmare . . . waiting, waiting, waiting to get a live person . . . then after more than an hour of diagnostic testing they tell me the router is defective (duh) and that I will need to call another number to "apply" for a replacement under the warranty. When I do, I'm told that before they can accept that the product is TRULY defective, more tests will have to be run and that I will need to call tech support again for that.  So I do . . .and after literally two more hours on the phone, they confirm absolutely that the product is defective and that I REALLY can call the other number to "apply" for that replacement . . when I do call the other number (they call it the "RMA Department"), they want a deposit on my credit card before they will ship so they can be assured I'll actually send them the defective one!   After all that incompetence, should I have to entrust them with my credit card information?  And what're they going to do with the defective product??  Sell it to YOU???? . . . . You get the picture.  I have a NetGear wireless router in my other home that works like a dream.  Steer clear of this Linksys product.

The trimmer works well in turbo mode for my beard, which I keep fairly short.  I'm not sure why there are two speeds; maybe the lower speed is for different whisker types or for longer lengths.I'd definitely recommend starting on a higher length setting and adjusting it shorter until it cuts at the desired length. The first time I used it I set it on "2" which turned out to be much shorter than I would have liked.    I especially like the vacuum feature.  Prior to getting this trimmer, there was hair all over the bathroom sink and counter that had to be wiped up after every trim session.  My only real complaint is that the unit I received has a flaw in the clear plastic window that covers the "length" number making it hard to see the number. I would buy it again.

I just checked it out at target. To sum it up it's a $120 toy. It just doesn't deliver on a HD level. The HD recording is a blurred mess. On the DV1 setting the video is near the quality of my miniDV camcorder, but it lacks many features. The fixed lens does not focus on close-up objects. Objects two or more feet away appear fine, but at those distances the audio turns tinny. I would not consider this an equal to a miniDV, nor would I really use it to record home videos. I'm giving it one star because if flat-out does not deliver on what it promises.

I have a very small toy fox terrier who has some fear issues.  I got her use to the nail file slowly. (I gave her a treat for sniffing it. I gave her a treat for sniffing it while the motor was on. I gave her a treat for letting me touch her nails with it. I gave her a treat for letting me touch her nails with it on, etc.) All of this took a couple of sittings but now that she is use to it, she wags her tail when I bring it out. It is great.  I never got her use to nail clippers, the vet has to muzzle her, so this is the only thing I could think about using, and it is very fast and effective.

So I got this after a co-worker said he loved it, it makes really HOT coffee and is delish! I brewed several cups of coffee and each time, even when I chose the "mug" or double cup serving, it only fills the 10 oz. mug 3/5ths of the way. I have to use 2 pods with a one cup size choice, because the coffee comes out SO WEAK. Now let's talk temperature. The only way I could see this coffee being hot enough is if you drink yours black and even then, I can't see anyone thinking it's hot enough. I use milk in my coffee and I have to go through the process of microwaving the milk first or microwaving the cup of brewed coffee with milk added, because the temperature is so sub-par. THe coffee smells great but it brews weak. Maybe they don't put enough grounds in the pod. I'm returning this after 1 day. It's not at all what I expected and as someone else pointed out, it takes up WAY TOO MUCH space for a 1-cup gadget.

The razor blades do not seem to be original Mach3 blades but cheap knockoffs or may be faulty ones.The first blade  I used did not give a clean shave in one stroke. I thought may be this is an exception, so I took the second one (from the same pack)but got the same below par results. Still not convinced that this is a faulty product I used a third blade with same poor shave.I have been using Mach3 razor for 10 years and am fairly confident that this is a low quality product.

We had an electric self-cleaning box before this one, but it shorted out after a couple weeks, and didn't work well to begin with.  Then we ordered this box, and though it takes some getting used to, it's the best box we could hope for, at a reasonable price.  Really easy to clean.  Despite its high wall, the cats DO manage to kick some litter outside the box, but certainly a smaller amount than most litter boxes.  I've found that crystal litter works very well to supplement this box for a lazy cat owner such as myself.  It sifts through the box's grating as well as normal clumping litter, if not better, and you don't have to change it nearly as often.

I felt ripped off when I read this book. Although I never really thought the series was written well, the books were addicting in a weird sort of way. They were my guilty pleasure. I got BD the night it was released and read it in one sitting. I felt so ripped off. It seemed like everything was done to fast and just to make that happy ending. I was annoyed by the almost anti-climax and the deus ex machina ending. Everything was made just to give the Cullens an edge and make the happy ending. That was it. There was never any real danger. I read the whole book feeling detatched. I'd read it if you've come this far in the series, but wait to get it from the library. Don't waste your money on this.

After purchasing it and using it for about a week, I can feel a significant improvement of my tooth cleanness and my gum health, it is definitely well worth the price.  I bought a really cheap ($10) electronic tooth brush (more of a vibrating tooth brush) before, and that cheap piece of crap is no where close to the performance of Oral-B Triumph.

So I got one for my mom's german shepherd and, after trying it on him, even got one for my (very short-haired) boxer mix.

Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program (What's this?)
      

Pros 1) ummm.......Looks nice Cons : Pretty much what has been said before 1) NO ENDNOTE SUPPORT (and in the absence of VBA, likely never to get endnote support in the near future) 2) Very slow in start-up! 3) Pricey, very pricey for what you get The only solution for academic users I suggest is to install and use "Bookends" by Sonny software, which they have had to use a scripts workaround to work with office 2008, but AT LEAST IT WORKS! (I've found bookends to be superior to endnote anyways) In summary, $400US for a facelift is a bit pricey...I think it is time for both Apple and Microsoft to get back to basics and address flaws in their software: pre-Intel the situation was far superior.

If you are looking for a movie with recycled plots (no pun intended), endless and banal cliches,and commonplace animation styles, then Wall-E is your movie.  A far cry from original and engaging works such as Ratatioulle, Shrek (pt. 1),and Beowulf.   Unlike most international films which are made by artists with integrity, Hollywood is more concerned with selling tickets to an undiscerning market.  How else can you explain the farce of three pirates of the Caribbean movies which become progressively worse, but sell more tickets with each subsequent release.  Time to demand more from Hollywood.

Reading some of the reviews made me hesitant, but I went ahead and ordered anyway.  I'm glad I did because the feeder is completely perfect.  The only difficulty was in the operator's error.  Reading the instructions helps big time.  If you can do that, you'll be fine.  You can set the feeding intervals for 1 to 3 times per day.  I like that.

This review is from: Let The Right One In (DVD)
      

First off, let me say, in my mind Let The Right One In is the best movie of 2008 ... period! That said, the DVD release is NOT the theatrical version!!! Read the other reviews if you would like to know what it's about but I want to make a quick comment on the DVD.First off, the english dubbing is a joke. Turn it off and go with the subtitles. Thre dubbing takes aways from the story and is almost laughable.Next, the subtitles are not correct and much is left out!!!! If you watched the trailer you see Oskar ask Eli to be his girlfriend ... a sweet moment between 2 tweleve year old kids ... in this version, the subtitle reads ... 'Do I have a chance with you?" WHAT????? What 12 year old talks like that??? The subtitles get worse, and much is left out.I've seen this movie 3 times in the theater, and reviewed for several websites. I'm sad to say, this DVD is not that movie. By changing the subtitles, and actually removing dialogue, the story has lost much of it innocence and taken the viewer on a trip that is confusing at times ... I guess the the producers of this film didn't feel American Viewers could understand the simple beauty of this story and had to sreamlime the dialouge and make it more adult ... Shame on them!!! I'll be loooking for a European release to purchase ...

When my husband told me that he wanted to buy the Battlestar Galactica-Season One DVD Set for a whopping $50, I said "No way,Jose". But one day, after spending a day out with my girlfriends, and leaving him home with our 2 little girls, I decided to surprise him with it. Needless to say, I, too, became addicted to this wonderful new series. The "New" Battlestar Galactica really does "break the mold". Unlike the original which was much more heavy-handed on the sci-fi side and appealed to a predominantly male audience, this series appeals to both men and women. It is one of the few TV shows where women have equal footing to the men. Mary McDonnell as President Roslin makes it plausible to think that a woman (a "kindergarten teacher" no less) is more than capable to rule the universe. I'm not sure who plays Starbuck (Tricia ___) but she, too, is another strong woman character who is the best pilot among a sea of (hunky) men :-)  I think it was a stroke of genius to make Starbuck a woman in the new series (Starbuck was a man in the original series). Then there's the romance between Sharon and Helo and the sexual tension between Starbuck, Dr. Gaius, and Captain Apollo not to mention the relationshio between Dr. Gaius and Number Six that keeps the screen steaming hot !In summary, I have to agree with the statement that it is indeed "the best show on television". It has excitement (=lots of explosions), suspense, romance, and most importantly, a stellar cast. I would also argue that the new series is more metaphysical in nature vs sci-fi. I agree that it is a bit heavy-handed with the whole religion thing but it does explore basic human yearnings and hopes and questions about what makes us human.Last night, we saw the last episode of Season One and I panicked. I commanded my husband to rush out and buy Seasons Two and Two-and-a Half.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

I liked this book a lot. I was kind of sad that Edward wasn't in the book as much, but Jacob was okay too. I feel really bad for Jacob in this book because in a way, Bella uses him. When she finds edward, she totally just leaves him. But, nonetheless, "New Moon" is still a good book. It wasn't as good as "Twilight", but if your going to read "Twilight", you need to read "New Moon" too. I can't wait until the next book "Eclipse", comes out!

Access 2007 does basically the same as any other previous versions, but they changed the screen presentation, so now everything is either hiding or in other places.  It is like having bought a different manufacturer's product. (In a car, now the brake pedal would be in the steering column and the light switch would be the accelerator....)I think I would have been better off downloading Open Office (for free.)Also, it is very expensive.

I ordered this product on Jan 7th, $53.99.It was shipped on Jan 10th.On Jan 11th Amazon dropped the price to $47.99, now $45.99.I have been advised by Amazon Customer Service that they will NOT price protect my purchase in spite of the fact that I haven't even received the product yet.  They told me to refuse the product, get my money back and then order at the reduced price.So Who's stupid?Jon

This book could have been so much more and it wasn't.  It dropped the whole series from second to third.  It ended better than harry potter but HP7 was a much better book.  I am most disappointed with Mrs. Meyer she could have made this so much better and she just took the easy way out with everything to make everyone happy.  Whats with the no fight at the end boring.  This book was boring and i wasted my time reading it.

I really can't say the product was bad as much as my cat didn't like it.  In fact, he disliked it so much that he stopped drinking water altogether and made himself very sick.  Make sure when you change products to something new that you observe your pets - I didn't realize my cat wasn't drinking the water because he didn't like how it tasted through this new system.

The keyboard on the Asus 1000 received today is abysmal. The whole keyboard sinks with each keystroke. It feels like the keyboard underlay is made of cardboard. I immediately repackaged the computer and sought the reseller's instructions for return.Please note that I have NEVER sent anything back to an internet seller. It's too much hassle. This product, however, failed to come close to it's stated purpose (typing), and I will go through the time and effort of seeking recourse.This might have been a 'first batch' product, in which case I will gladly wait for a replacement. I have gone so far as to suggest to the Amazon reseller that if the Linux product has a better keyboard, I would pay any increase in cost (within reason) and order it.The reseller's name has been withheld, and I hope this purchase has a 'happy ending'.

My old Foreman Grill just died in the middle of grilling some chicken and sent me to the store looking for something new.  I had intended to get the Foreman Grill w/ the removable plates until I saw the Cuisinart Griddler.  I was immediately interested in the fantastic design - aesthetics do matter when an appliance will be sitting on the counter all the time.  Unfortunately, the Foreman Grill is big and ugly (except for the Michael Graves designed Foreman Grill that is only at Target.... and doesn't have removable plates).  However, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the extra dough for the better design.  But when I realized I could use it as both a contact grill and a flat grill..... and a panini press (that floating hinge is essential for the panini) and as a griddle I felt it was worth the extra money.  My one concern was that the grease wouldn't drain out properly because there is no tilt to the machine.  I took it home, hooked it up and found that it cooked and drained just excellently.My one caveat....... it should come with plates to make waffles!  That would make it the ultimate micro appliance.

it was very flustrating to order something on line that you were going to the store to buy only to wait several weeks to get. Being a tax help product only made things worse in that we set several days aside to do our taxes and get an early jump on a refund and could not. Once i found the link to get reimbursed, Amozon responded imedeatly. I'm thankful for their response time.I will be careful to avoid PrestigeRetail in the future.

I think Stever Harvey did a good job with this book.  He has given women a lot to think about and any men who read the book as well.  I think it was a quick and easy read.  I believe that it will be something that I refer back to at different times in my relationship.  I am someone who is engaged and still found helpful hints, tips, explanations, etc.  It is definitely worth owning and having in your private collection.

I installed this in my Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit edition) desktop computer and it was instantly recognized and updated drivers were downloaded on the first Windows Update session. This is about as plug-n-play as it gets. I live in a neighborhood with public wireless access provided by our association. The external antenna included with this card provides either Very Good or Excellent signal strength (802.11b) at all times. This little PCI card is just a pleasure to use. Install and forget. I much prefer it over a USB dongle wireless for the better antenna and the price is certainly right. Drivers are also available for linux or FreeBSD users as well.

No problems here. The drive works everytime. I store E-Bay graphics on it. I have yet to have any of the PNY drives fail me. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it was a bit thinner.

It's unfortunate that I have to post a negative review on this product as I have used many other Linksys products in the past, and they have all been great.However this particular router, which I purchased about 1 month ago, appears to be a major exception. My router was a version 5 router, and was delivered with version 1.00.0 firmware. As a former electrical engineer, with 20+ years in the PC industry I know it is never a good thing to get the first version of anything. Nevertheless I pressed on.Installation is supposed be done using their super installation CD, (which I dislike intensely, as I like to know what the "experts" are doing to my system). Nevertheless, I tried the CD. It is supposed to help the wireless neophyte install a secure system. As expected, it bombed halfway through the install. I cleaned my system, downloaded the real user manual from the Lynksys website, and proceeded to install the router.It worked great! Range was fantastic and all was well. The security was easy to set up if you knew what you were doing. (Several internet sites will describe this process step by step, and it seems that even the most elementary security will be better than what most people use as I found 2 unsecured wireless networks from my own living room).However, after about a day, and then almost every day or two the router would lose its connection with my broadband cable network. FWIW, I'm on Optonline, have a stable PC running XP-Pro and use a Motorola Surfboard SB4100 as a cable modem. As 4 other PC's were also connected to the network, I would find out pretty fast when the connection was dropped. The only solution was a hardware reset.I spoke with India 3 times in pursuit of a solution. They tried everything including a firmware upgrade, and a disabling of most protocols that had worked for 5+ years with my old dependable Linksys BEFSR41 Router. (One even suggested that I might have been better off if I could find a Version 4 router) I finally got through to a Cisco technical support rep in NY who suggested another bios update and then closed my "issue".The connection would now go for a few days before dropping, when I finally took the advice of a friend, (with a Netgear wireless router with similar problems), and converted the router to a Wireless Access Point, WAP. I reinstalled my old trusty BEFSR41 as the main router for the cable modem, and disabled DHCP in the WRT54G - You will need to set up a static IP address for the wireless router that's different from the normal 192.168.1.1 and change where the DHCP starts to number the dynamic addresses.It's been running without a glitch for 2 weeks now. As I bought it from Amazon, and had already processed a rebate claim, I thought it would be better to do this than try for a swap and return. Prospective buyers should check the latest bios and beware.

I like the camera alot.  However, the camera is no good without software to download, transfer and edit.  The Imagemixer software is terrible - it is very difficult to use, it comes with no documentation, and the Pixela technical support is awful.  I am an experienced Movie Maker user and was surprised that Canon would supply such mediocre software.

By far the best baby gate I have ever used. Needed to keep baby on one side and dogs on the other yet still be able to walk through.This gate was simple to set up, and is tall enough to keep the dogs (Boxers) from jumping over! Then the swinging door lets you go from room to room with a simple push of a tab.Highly recommended, and I plan to buy another one once the grandbaby starts moving!

I purchased this product for my HP laptop, which uses Windows Vista.  I couldn't get it to open or install, so I went onto the Norton website and started a Live Chat session.  My support person couldn't get it to work either, so they just downloaded the program from their website.  We finally got it installed, after several hours.  The whole reason I ordered a CD rather than an internet download was so I would have the CD in case something happened to my laptop, (it crashed about 6 months ago and the whole hard drive had to be replaced).  The product itself is OK, but it was annoying to waste so much time and energy when it should have just installed automatically.

Ok folks, time to get a little personal here. I have been looking for something to trim certain areas that are, how do you say it, sensitive? I wasn't about to us my face Norelco there, nor a blade, so I put this one on my wish list. Lo and behold, under the tree it appeared. I charged it overnight and the next day gave it a test. I started with the #3 comb and carefully trimmed around my, ummm, guys. Not bad; no pulling, no nicks. I continued around, being very careful. Came out pretty good. I then went a little nuts, meaning crazy. I removed the #3 and clipped on the #1. Even better; nice and trim. Wife is happy which make me happy. I have since removed the comb completely and gone with the smooth look. Caution here for the guys, GO SLOWLY! Patience is a virtue! And less painful.

This is the best season so far of a stellar show.  Seasons 1 and 2 were both great, but season 3 goes the extra mile because the writers showed complete fearlessness by letting it get dark.  The bleak sensibility is endemic to the series' circumstances; what we have here is pure existentialism.  What hooked me into Battlestar from the beginning was not just obviously the amazing mini-series, but moreover its ending, when Admiral Adama admits privately that though he's just given a speech to the entire remaining human race about how they're now heading for Earth, he has no idea where Earth is.  This season goes beyond the tit-for-tat space battles with the cylons, which I do love.  The creators had the courage to dig down deep into the premise, to deal with life on board these ships, both human and cylon.  I love that we spend time on board the cylon bay ships, that we see the human class differences and basic social structure perpetuating from the colonies, that we really get the feeling of not just hopelessness that was present in season 2, but of resolve.  Most television programs turn away from that kind of darkness/depth and retreat when confronted with the prospect of boring down into the most organic inner recesses of a given premise.  That retreat is often referred to as "jumping the shark".  The creators of this new Battlestar series are crafting Sartre-esque literature.

Absolutely love this series. Although the gore from the 1st series has been somewhat toned down, the story is just as good. Unlike many American TV shows Dexter does not just ask more questions that it provides answers for.There is much more intimacy and its still full of twists and dark humour.I cant wait for the next series... :)

This product while still making good popcorn has been made much cheaper than the older models. The material that the top and the clamps that hold it on to the kettle are so thin and weak that it barely stays attached when dumping the popcorn. I had an older version that was far superior manufacture to the present model. I would rather pay more for a better made item than what is being made now.

We have 3 of these gates and love them.  They work great and were easy to install.  My son still cannot get over or through these gates.  He sometimes stands on them, but cannot get them open.  We've had them for almost 2 years now and still use them daily.  I definately recommend these over the plastic or pressure type gates.

The Asus eee PC is the funnest little gizmo I've seen in a while.  I bought it as a satellite unit for my real computer but I find myself using it more often than my powerhouse. It's very light, so I take it everywhere I go, and while it's only 800mhz it's a nimble little thing.  It boots in about 20 seconds, and Xandros is the kindest version of Linux I've seen. When you start out it has these big icons that make it easy for kids to use, but I switched over to "Advanced Mode" which makes it look and act like a Windows clone. This is a nice way to dabble in Linux without making the plunge.  It works well with most common USB add-ons, flash drives, mice and keyboards, even the Xbox 360 HD DVD player. But sadly, there is no iTunes for Linux and when you plug your iPod in, it launches it's mp3 player and plays select songs.  It does charge it at least.   The typewriter is a bit small but it's touchtype-able, (I use just six fingers, my pinkies get a break) After using it a while regular keyboards seem really big. Bottom line, This is a great secondary computer and it seems it was designed with being a back up in mind (It comes with a DVD that requires Windows to play) But it's a lot of computer for the money and it's got an extensive and friendly online community that can walk you through pretty much anything you could want to do with it.  You'll see why it's got a worldwide cult following.  Perfect for students and children.

Let me start out by saying I am a novice to video editing. I read about the problems with .mod files before I bought this camera, but purchased it anyway.  The files were driving me nuts.  I tried everything I read on reviews and nothing seemed to work real well.  I was using a pretty old version of Adobe Premiere Elements.  I read some reviews on this web site  http://video-editing-software-review.toptenreviews.com/.  I downloaded a trial version of the two top rated which were CyberLink PowerDirector 7 and Corel Video Studio X2.  I used the software that came with the camera to put the video files on my hard drive.  The were saved as .mpg file (not .mod files).  Using either of these applications, I was able to edit the files and make perfect DVDs in both 4:3 and widescreen. I preferred Corel Video Studio and purchase it.  It is so easy to use.  So now I don't have any problems with this Canon .mod files at all.  Of course I had to buy new software, but my Adobe version was pretty old anyway.  In regards to the camera, I really like it because it is small and convenient.  What I don't like is that it is not good in low light and is very shaky when using the zoom.  But for the price I really like this camera

The product is exactly as advertised - virtually smokeless indoor grill. We use ours for Korean barbecue every week. We cook meats and vegetables at the table and then dip in sauces and roll up in lettuce leaves. Great non-stick surface - very easy to clean. Avoid marinating in sweet sauces though since that will create some smoke and a mess on the grill. Better to do a simple marinade (if any at all) and then dip in sauce afterwards. Overall - an excellent indoor grill.

Last years product continually gave problems to the point that I couldn't even open it on my PC.  Several contacts with Tech Support did nothing to solve the problems. I thought I would give it one more chance and this year's version wouldn't even download.  When contacting Tech Support they were, once again, unable to remedy the problem. I returned it, ordered H & R Block's TaxCut, and could file today if I had received all the required paperwork.  Simple, efficient, and no problems!!!

I have been a Turbo Tax user since '91.  I have become annoyed by the multiple deceptive and confusing versions they have released over the past couple of years.  I have not been willing to switched to Tax Cut, because I was use to Turbo Tax, and I use Quicken (which I am also equally frustrated with).The screwup that Intuit did this year with Turbo Tax (decepetive versions, significant crippling of product, plus price increase), has finally convinced me that it is time to switch to Tax Cut.Intuit needs to eliminate it's current marketing dept and start fresh and go back to it's roots of delivering great reliable products that help their customers.  Scott needs to step back in, fire his chief marketing exec. and clean up the mess this new incompetent marketing team has created.

We put this on our wish list for Christmas and received it as a Christmas gift.  I am usually very hesitant about buying anything that some "famous" person has put their name on, just because I think it's kind of shady (I don't like the idea of paying for the "name" and making someone, who already has enough money, even wealthier).  But I read every single review for every single popcorn popper and this one seemed like the best, so I went ahead and put it on our wish list.We couldn't be happier than we are with this popcorn popper!  It's perfect!  PROS ~* It pops probably 95% of the kernels.* It's fast.* It's healthier (and not to mention, safer), since it uses hot air to pop the kernels and not oil.* The popped kernels don't scatter and shoot out everywhere- the plastic top piece is there to "guide" the popcorn into the bowl so you won't end up with a huge mess.  Just make sure you have a big enough bowl!  (My husband made the popcorn the first night we used it and chose a bowl that was WAY too small and so we had some overflowing, whoops! ;-) )* Price!  If we didn't receive this as a gift for Christmas, I was going to buy it anyway.CONS ~* It's pretty loud, although that's to be expected.  If we're watching TV, we wait until a commercial break to make the popcorn.

I bought the BBC version of this incredible film ~ and, I must say, I'll be buying the Discovery Channel version with Sigourney Weaver narrating VERY soon.  After seeing it on television, I was so enthralled that I couldn't wait to own it.  I hadn't heard Attenborough's voice in quite a few years, and I thought it would be fine, even though I LOVE Weaver's voice with this film.  No disrespect meant to the legendary David Attenborough, a demi-god among naturalists, but his voice is very difficult to listen to at this point, and I find that it's very distracting.  I often press the mute button ~ and I know a lot of other people who were equally disappointed when they bought the BBC version.  I'm certain that this is why Discovery aired this with a change of narrators.

I obsessed on this for a while before buying the product---reading all the reviews here, especially Gina Miller's great review and instructional notes.  Based on the reviews read here, I wanted to see how long it would take to go from start to finish with this camera.  From the time I met the UPS guy in the driveway to recording a video took approx 2 minutes.  The thing that took the longest was figuring out how to open the battery door (dumb on my part, not the product).   I took a quickie and went to test it on the computer. I had a video uploaded to YouTube within 5 minutes of the UPS guy driving off.  I don't understand the problems people had, but would recommend contacting Flip/Digitial Technologies in case you just have a lemon.  Others have commented on the record button, even my fat fingers had no issue with this.Someone commented that it was too easy to delete.  My camera (Flip Ultra) it took two presses of the button to delete--one to delete and the next to confirm.  This is typical for any piece of technology. All I can say is I love it, I love it, I love it!  And, after showing it off on the holidays have managed to sell a few too!

Battlestar Galactica is, by far, the best current show on television.  Season four is great. Others have commented on the content.I am incensed, however, that they have once again decided to make us pay twice for a single season by doing the silliness of breaking the season into a 4.0 and 4.5, and charging full price for each.  They did this for season two, people complained, and they returned to sensibility for the season three single package.I will purchase season 4 when it is complete, and for a price that is fair for one season, not two.  If it is not released this way, then I guess I'll have to wait a few years until it is readily available used or at fire sales.

A great proton pump inhibitor.  Every patient is different but in my experience good old Prilosec is often a fantastic choice.  Patients don't need a prescription to buy it and it's been on the market so long that it's proven to be safe and reliable.  Based on my own clinical knowledge it works at least as well as Nexium and many of the other competing PPIs.  Highly recommended for all heartburn and acid reflux sufferers.  If you try it and it doesn't work for you, move onto the more expensive scrips; but try this one first!

Although this is my first netbook, I have experience with several brands and sizes of laptops.  I love this little computer. Before purchasing it I had also researched the ASUS 901, 904HA, 1000HA, the Samsung NC10, Dell mini 9, and Lenovo ideapad. I chose this one because it looked sturdy, had a 6 cell battery option, has wireless b/g/n and bluetooth, 160gb hdd and 1gb ram for a price lower than comparable models in other brands. And its cute. Here are some of my feelings on the product:1) The lack of an optical drive can be a little inconvenient, but one cannot be expected in such a small package. Given the abundance of online downloads offered by major industries (gaming, virus protection, word documents) this really does not present much of a problem except for playing cds or dvds.2) I had read in several reviews that the larger 6 cell battery makes the unit "tippy." I have noticed that if I push the screen without holding the keyboard it will lean backwards (keep in mind the entire thing is &lt;3lbs), but I also lounge with this machine on the couch and it has yet to tumble backwards.    3) While reading reviews on various netbooks I found that a common complaint was their inability to multitask or operate quickly.  I find that this little netbook is able to have several tabs open at once, while downloading and supporting word documents.  With its 1gb ram it is not the fastest, but I certainly have no complaints.  Even with ZoneAlarm Security Suite and ForceField running in the background the Wind still boots up at a snappy pace and surfs the net easily.4) I admit that I was concerned about the battery life of this machine because I could find very little about its realtime life.  One of the major draws toward the ASUS 904 was that most reviews said that it got around 5 hours. The Wind does not get quite that much, more like 4-4.5 hours while typing and browsing the web. I was surprised that during its initial setup (installation of web browser, virus software, word) it pulled about 3.5-4 hours despite numerous restarts.5) The keyboard is quite comfortable for my hands. My first laptop had a 12" screen so I am accustomed to slightly smaller keyboards, and I suppose the size of this one might be a problem for some. One feature I particularly like is that my thumb does not hit the touchpad when I go for the space bar as it did on many netbooks. Punctuation buttons are also smaller.5) Some reviews had mentioned that the touchpad only had one button. Yes, this is true, but the two sides of that button operate as left and right mouse buttons. If you try to push it in the middle nothing happens.  Unlike some other netbooks, the touchpad button does not require much pressure.6) The wireless networks that I have tried thus far have been easy to connect to and have an excellent connection (not the connection that the computer shows, but the internet works quickly and I am not booted off).7) The side vents are WONDERFUL! In the past I have had a problem blocking my laptops' vents by putting them on the couch/carpet/my lap.  This is not a problem with the Wind, which vents air through vents on the left side.One Note: Most pictures show the computer without the battery.  The 6 cell battery does boost the computer up a bit, which was initially of great concern, but I have found that it is not too much to worry about unless you are set on having it flush against the desk.I have already ordered an additional gb of ram since the machine can support 2gb, and I can't wait to see how it runs with that.

Not a big fan of hair on any part of my body other than my head. And as a brother with kinky hair all over, using razors is not a pleasant option for removing unwanted hair. This product works great for me. I can shave or trim until my hearts content in a fraction of the time it took using razors. The motor is powerful enough and the blades are sharp enough to remove the hair in 2 sweeps the most. What used to take 10-15 mins in the shower now takes 5 mins the most.I will certainly recommend this product especially for people of color with curly hair like me.

I was so excited to finally get a sound machine, after a coworker of mine had been talking up her own and saying how great it was for restful sleep.This machine has six functions, and after testing out each one, I found that they all seem to be a 30 second sound clip that merely repeats itself over and over and over throughout the night.  Something about hearing the same exact seagull squawk in the ocean sound every 30 seconds drove me nuts! I had to turn it off because I just could not get relaxed.You're better off buying $20 of relaxation songs off iTunes and playing them through your iPod than buying this machine.  At least then, you can pick what sound you want to listen to, and it'll be much better composed and more random - allowing for better relaxation - than the machine's sounds.

I've had two of these products. The large one was great, my dog Rocco had fun figuring out how to get the food out and became quite a pro at it. It is a good time killer for the dogs as they don't have much to do anyway. Then I forget to take it one time after he was done and he chewed through the rope. Well I liked to so much I go to get another and it's the smaller size. This one had a rubber rope instead of cloth. It didn't move smoothly and Rocco couldn't get ANY treats out of it. That rubber rope just doesn't glide as well as the cloth it sticks. Get the large one, even a small dog should be able to handle it.

Here are my impressions of this sad, sad "book":1.  Edward & Bella's relationship - This was the biggest disappointment in the book.  All romance completely and utterly vanished.  This book pretty much ruined their romance for me. 2.  Different tone - The book had a completely different tone from the previous three.  It didn't even feel like the same author/series.  What replaced the exhilarating, somewhat innocent romance was disgusting and disturbing (i.e. the pregnancy, birth, transformation, imprinting on Renesme, etc.)  I found myself literally gagging at some parts.  Don't know how they'll make THIS one into a movie!  Actually, a movie could be a good thing.  The writer could completely change every dumb thing that Meyer did and fix the story!3.  Inconsistent Characters - This is kind of like #2.  None of the characters (with the exception of Jacob) were anything like their former, lively, loveable selves.  They were mere shadows of what they'd been in the past.   I could go on and on on this one, but it would take too long to go through every character.  I'll get to a couple of the main ones.4.  Edward -  He was a mopey, brooding non-factor for 95% of the book completely devoid of charisma, charm, and personality.  At one particularly low moment, he even suggests that Bella can fornicate with JACOB just so she can have babies!!!!!!!!  WHAT?!?!?!   I had less love for Edward after this book for sure.5.  The Wedding - My wedding was better than Bella's, and she had endless money, vampire talents, and a writer's imagination and creativity to work with! 6.  The Sex - OK, so it's a young adult book (although I don't really think a lot of the material IS suitable for young adults in this one)... I get the whole "fade to black" thing.  But, afterward, did Bella really have to turn into a whiney, sniveling twit, begging for it????7.  Disappearance of the Cullens - They were barely in this book at all, except for Rosalie's disturbing, overbearing protection of Bella's stomach.  I don't think Esme had one sentence to say the whole time.  I couldn't believe how little Alice was involved in the book.  She was one of the best characters in the other three.  How could Meyer just abandon her?  And the whole thing where she leaves Bella a "clue" about her disappearance in a book... Gimme a break. 8.  Pregnancy - Really dumb plot line.  I can't even believe she went there.  Not only is it gross, but pretty implausible considering he's a VAMPIRE.  Do they have super-sperm now, too?9.  Renesme Carlie -  Need I say more?10.  Jacob The Pedophile - I don't care how she "cleverly" set this up by making Quil imprint on a little kid and trying to explain that away.  It is still really disturbing and dumb... and, oh, a little too convenient that he imprinted on Renesme.  He was the only character whose "voice" didn't change, which was nice, but I really am offended at the way Meyer resolved his character.  He deserved way more after the way Bella figuratively kicked the crap out of him for two books.11.  Bella's Anticlimactic Transformation - For three books we've been told how painful, how awful the transformation is.  We were told how difficult it is to be a newborn vampire, and how a person loses himself/herself for a while.  Now, granted that Meyer unsubtlely set Bella up to practically not be a human in the first place, since she obviously didn't fit in with humanity for many reasons, but still... it was all so easy!  The pain was barely mentioned, and practically from the first second she "woke up," she was THE perfect "vegetarian" vampire.  Not even a struggle!  What a joke!12.  Charlie - I don't even know where to start with this one.  He's perfectly fine with the existence of werewolves and the knowledge that his daughter is obviously not the same as she was AND that he has a granddaughter already who ages at an insane rate........ as long as you don't give him any details.  Ignorance is bliss, I guess.  So convenient that he can still be in Bella's life now.13.  Renee - I guess Bella didn't need to freak out about what her mother would think about getting married as a teenager.  Oh yeah, did I mention that Bella got married as a teenager?  I thought we were in Washington, not the deep South.14.  New Cast of Characters - Some of the "vampire army" that assembled at the Cullen house was interesting.  But there were so many of them!  Meyer just kept piling them on.  They ended up not even being necessary and just watered-down the plot.15.  The Non-Battle w/the Volturi - The battle was getting a little tense until the Volturi completely backed down like a bunch of...   kitty cats.  These Volturi don't seem so scary to me anymore.  After all, they didn't kill Edward, Bella, and Alice in Volterra (without much of a struggle or argument at all, mind you) and they took their sweet time to check out the Seattle vampires in Eclipse.  Really, it just seemed like all you had to do was "wink, wink" at Aro, and he'd let you slide.16.  Bella the Non-Heroine - This one has two parts:A) It would have been a little more redeeming if Bella had saved them all with her shield.  At least then she would have some point in the book.  But she didn't!  It was Alice who rushes in from who-knows-where with some ridiculous explanation about finding other vamps like Renesme who saves the day.  Really convenient that Meyer made up these new beings at the precise moment that she needed them.  Let's write a book and just make crap up from out of the blue AT the climax to save all our characters.  No one important died, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but would add depth/credibility to the overall struggle in the book.B)   Bella doesn't have to sacrifice anything.  In the end, she gets everything she wants, all tied up with a neat little bow.  She doesn't have to give up being a mother to be with Edward (which was a big deal in Eclipse).  She suddenly wants to be married, go to college, have kids, etc.  She doesn't have to give up her soul, because apparently no one really cared about that anymore or mentioned it much in the book.  She doesn't have to give up Charlie.  She doesn't give two thoughts about what she'll do about Renee, so I guess she doesn't care.  She doesn't have to hurt Jacob anymore because he magically doesn't love her.  She doesn't have to struggle with Edward over the notion of her becoming a vampire... he doesn't have a choice in the matter--she'll die if she doesn't become one.  She doesn't have to go through any pain, suffering, or uncertainty when she becomes a newborn vampire.   She doesn't have to worry about the Volturi.  Bella had so much potential to be a great character.  Meyer just completely blew it.17.  The Werewolves Aren't Werewolves - Oh yeah, did we forget to mention that they're actually NOT werewolves?  They're actually shapeshifters, so, yeah... no problem.18.  The Writing Blows - In Meyer's defense, it always did.  There are a myriad of technical reasons I could get into about why Meyer is a terrible writer, but they're really moot at this point.  This book lacked what the other three did to make up for it: wit, interesting characters, love, and charm. Some people are annoyed by the way Bella gets married and has a kid young and that the ending is happy.  There are also a lot of sexist notions in the book, but I won't go into that here, and I'm usually not bothered by that kind of thing in general.  I don't really mind the ending either, I just wished some of the above had been different.  Thank goodness for the movie... It got me back into the series.  But I'll probably never read Breaking Dawn again.  I'll just pretend it ended with Eclipse and imagine my own ending.  It's sure as sh** better than what Meyer came up with!  What a cash cow!  She should be ashamed!On a side note, there is another book called Midnight Sun, that retells Twilight from Edward's point of view.  She wrote about 250 pages of it and then it somehow got leaked on the internet.  She says she's so heartbroken and destroyed over it that she won't finish it or publish it now.  I think that's B.S.  I think she's so sick over how bad Breaking Dawn is and how so many people slam it and hate it and how she ruined the series, that she's chicken to finish Midnight Sun.  Cop-out.

I'm sure under the right circumstances this is a great product.  In fact, I use a Linksys wireless router at home with a Linksys cable modem and have never had any problems.HOWEVER: If you use AT&T DSL, this product ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DOES NOT WORK with a Siemens SpeedStream 4100 DSL modem.  AT&T does not give you the option of using any modem but the one they send you so do yourself a favor and try a web search using the name of your modem and the name of the router you are thinking of purchasing to find any compatibility issues.

My last diffuser worked great and then after a few months stopped.  I bought this one as a replacement but it seems as though after nearly 4 weeks my cat is still spraying and acting out.  I'm going to try using the feliway spray as well and see if the result puts the cat back on track & problem free.This product was once very effective but did not last long.  Its great when it works and a nightmare when it doesn't.  At about $20 a diffuser and $20 each month for the feliway the costs add up.

This flat iron is worth every penny and then some!  The money you will save on styling products alone makes it a value.I took my flat iron to a girls beach weekend and did everyone's hair...they all went out to buy this flat iron immediately.  It makes your hair so straight, soft and shiny.  It gets super hot, so it straightens VERY quickly.  Even the curliest of hair will get straight.  Be sure to use a thermal protecting spray before use...it not only protects your hair but adds to the shine.  There is NO comparison to a cheap flat iron.  You will NOT regret buying this!

In the past 3 years I have tried MANY pedometers, Omron, Sportline, McDonald's promotional, etc. Omron is the only brand that I have found to be at all accurate. About 3 months ago I read about the newer HJ-112 in Health magazine and knew I had to get one. This pedometer is the most accurate one to date. I love the fact that I can stick it inconspicuously in my pocket or purse and still count my steps. Most others would pop off my waistband at some point and I would lose them. It is amazing how much more aware I am of my daily movement. Every step, and every short walk really adds up. One word of warning: be careful to remember to REMOVE it from your pocket before laundering your pants. I have already sent mine through the washing machine. Fortunately it dried out and still works perfectly, but from now on, I am keeping it inside a sealed Ziploc in my pocket..just in case.

This is absolutely the worst software product I've bought!!!!  I purchased QB PRO 2009 for the first time 3 weeks ago.  This is a new installation, not an upgrade, on a brand-new computer.  I've had nothing but trouble.  The first occurred trying to set-up the company file.  Tech support wanted to charge me $79 to figure out their problem, but did not charge me when they determine that it WAS a software problem, not my computer.  Today, I tried to open the software and received an error message about the "qbregistration.dat" file.  14 hours later, I still cannot open QB, I've been through every bit of the online community and software knowledge suggestions, I even talked with a peon in tech support who could only resend me the software knowledge suggestions.  Obviously, there is a SERIOUS problem with their software, but Intuit will not investigate the problem until I pay them another $79.  They will not even look to see if the problem is on their end or my end.  At least Peachtree offers 30 days free tech support!!!!  I will be returning this product and buying Peachtree tomorrow.  I strongly advise anyone considering QB to rethink that decision.  Truly, 1 star was too high praise, I just had to pick something.  If I had my way, I would not have picked even one star.

I read the reviews here and don't agree with most of them.  I'm a very technical, IT sort of person who just wants stuff to work.  I don't update the firmware or do anything crazy, just work and this device doesn't seem to do that.  It started when the device kept dropping wireless connections like my xbox360 and tivo and my laptop that I use to vpn into work.  I called Motorola, they had me run some diagnostics and agreed to take the modem back.  I was sent a new device.  It worked flawlessly for a couple of months (like the last one) and now it's not dropping wireless connections but seems to just stop working.  All lights are lit solid and I have to reboot it to get it to working order, at times, I can't even get into the web interface and have to unplug it.  My ISP is Comcast and I live in MA.  I'll be looking for a new device this weekend to at least handle the routing and try to keep this device just for the modem.UPDATE 1/31/2009:  I purchased an Apple Airport Extreme and turned everything on the SBG900 off to pretty much turn it into a modem only, hooked everything back up and now I have zero issues, more than twice the bandwidth and signal strength.  Devices that listed 54 mbps and 2-3 bars are now 130 mbps and 4 solid bars.  This clearly tells me that this product works flawlessly as a modem, but has serious issues as both.

I very much appreciate the concepts and ideas behind "The Secret".  The idea that one has control over their own destiny and personal power is an extremely important shift in thinking.  However, I was very disappointed in the materialistic, self-serving bent stressed by "The Secret".  It focused on individual material gain, with no mention of one's responsibility to improving the world.  I also found the racial dynamics of the film disturbing.  Far from being universal, "The Secret" specifically targets the white middle class audience.  "The Secret" also privileges white men, almost exclusively, with being the historical holders of 'the secret', while implying that others have suffered because they have never figured 'it' out, and don't know any better.  These undercurrents are too blatant to ignore.  So, if you do purchase this film, be aware of the implications.  Other materials, such as works by Louise Hay, and Gary Zukav, or books like "Ask and it is Given", certainly give the same message with a more balanced, compassionate approach.

I bought 2 sets of these sheets thinking the bad reviews here were wrong. They weren't. The fitted sheets are too small for my queen size bed so they are worthless. Also, I bought these sheets because the description said they had elastic all around the fitted sheets. They do not. Only on 2 sides. I am returning these to Amazon. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy them to begin with.

I have never used a worse flash drive in my life!  I purchased the PNY for transporting files.  I plugged in the first one purchased both on my work PC and my home PC.  It didn't work.  I exchanged it for the same model.  It didn't work on my home PC or my work PC.  I had the IT staff at work take a look at each of the PNY flash drives and they had the same results as me.  I spent over thirty minutes trying to find a customer service number on the PNY website.  They don't have one.  The only telephone number is buried in the warranty section.  There is no e-mail support.  This drive is the biggest piece of junk out there!  Also, take a glance at the class action law suit announced on the PNY website.Do NOT buy PNY.

Unless you're an expert with setting up wireless routers, I implore you to not buy this. I have done everything regarding following the instructions, however it's still no use. I have seen professionals from Comcast and Cox cable come in and somehow magically get theirs (just like mine) to work without following any of the instructions that come with the product either. I don't know what that's about, but it's annoying.  I can't keep spending two hundred dollars to have someone set this up everytime I move. The instructions that it came with should be good enough, but they are absolutely useless. I've wasted five hours one afternoon just trying to get this thing working. I'm not a computer novice either, which tells me you seriously have to be an expert, like working for the cable companies.  Now I'm just going to buy a Linxys and pitch this P.O.S.  More waste for the damn landfill...ugh.

I'm on my 2nd Netgear router. Our first one had the nasty habit of dropping the connection when using a variety of programs. With the only solution being power cycling the router, my roommates and I found ourselves frequently running back to the living room to restart the router, usually several times a day. We eventually took the router, smashed it to bits with a hammer, and replaced it with a better product for $20 less.I've moved into another home which also uses a Netgear router (provided by our ISP) and it's the same story. Within the last hour I've had to reset it 4 times, and I've had it. I came here looking for any information on how to fix the problem, only to find a slew of people with the same problem on SEVERAL Netgear routers.I'm calling my ISP tomorrow to have them use a different brand of product, because I simply refuse to use another Netgear product. I don't understand how major problems like this can get by Quality Assurance on several products and still aren't fixed after a long time.Save yourself time, frustration and money by not purchasing a Netgear router.

I purchased this dog bed for the first time last year.  I have a Great Dane and expected it to last a few months, if that.  Over a  year later I bought another one through Amazon.  I cannot believe how well this bed has held up!  The first one was out on our porch (the "mud room.")  The Dane leaps upon it with our Seeing Eye trainee in hot pursuit, and then both will curl up and sleep on it.  Our new one is in the house, where our Dane will take naps or the dogs bounce off before I can remind them of "indoor play!"  This product has been a terrific value for the price, has withstood more weight than I anticipated, and you can bet I will be buying another for a different room.

My cat had a bad habit of trying to drink out of any source of water that wasn't his water bowl.  If I set down a glass of water, he'd try to stick his face in it.  If I left the faucet dripping, he'd lap at it.  If I left the toilet seat up he'd.... ew.  I bought the Drinkwell Platinum hoping it would be more appealing to him than these other things and it worked great.  After setting up the Drinkwell I put him in front of it and after a couple minutes of mesmerized staring at the fountain he started drinking from it and has used it since.The noise is pretty minimal.  The pump's motor has a hum that I only notice if I'm right beside the fountain.  Normal refrigerator and air conditioner sounds easily drown it out.  One time after cleaning it was much louder than normal, I took it apart and noticed I hadn't secured the motor tightly to the bowl (it uses suction cups) and it was rattling.  A quick push into place and it was back to its usual quiet operation.  If you're finding the noise to be excessive, that might be something to check.  At higher speeds, the water gurgles as it drops into the bowl but I actually find this sound rather soothing.  If you don't like it just turn the speed down and the water is nearly silent.Assembly was a snap, and taking it apart for cleaning is equally simple.  I've had no problems with leaks or really with anything.  I like this product a lot and more importantly, so does my cat.  I'd highly recommend it to anybody with a pet.

I purchased the Aspire One as a Christmas gift for my 10 year-old son, whose USB toys and games are slowly taking over our desktop computer. (Plus I want one for myself and wanted to try it out first!) I set it up the night we got it so it would be ready on Christmas day.Even though I'd been looking at reviews for months, the size of the One astounded me. It's SO tiny! I had some difficulty getting the battery to snap in (one of the metal connectors was slightly bent) but once I got it, I was booted and installing WinXP within minutes. Initial setup, removing the bloatware, and adding our preferred virus software and all my son's games took about an hour. The battery had about 77% when I turned it on, so it was fully charged by the time I finished setting everything up.The keyboard took a few minutes to get used to, but soon I was typing away with no problem. The screen, surprisingly, is easy to see and read with no straining even with my horrible eyesight. At one point, I had probably 10 windows open and the One never even slowed down. Wifi picked up our home network within seconds and actually showed a few connections that our other computers don't see.Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I know when my son opens it tomorrow he'll be thrilled to have his own computer that is sized for him. I ordered a Pirates of the Caribbean DVD player case from Target that will serve as his computer bag, as well as the neoprene sleeve sold here on Amazon in case he wants to throw it in his backpack. Our extended family members are already fighting over who gets to use it first!

I purchased this as a physician to dictate directly into my office's EMR, but quickly discovered Nuance has disabled this feature with version 10. Version 9 Preferred would work in EMR's. Sure, they have a significantly more expensive "medical" version - in the $1400 range, but for essentially the same thing. The basic architecture for the program is identical, just an expanded medical database. Is that really worth another $1200? An online message board for my EMR is full of frustrated comments from other doctors who've been stung by this quirk from Nuance. Unfortunately for Nuance, they may have violated anti-trust laws by doing this. I agree with the above reviews as well, the installation process is severely flawed. Simply said, don't waste your time and money with version 10. I'm returning my purchase and going back to version 9.

I bought this item when I first got back into running to help keep up with how far I was going.  I have used it both outside and on a treadmill.  It only has one setting for stride.  My stride is different for a leisurely stroll, walking for exercise and jogging or running.  I wore my pedometer on the treadmill.  It was accurate for the leisurely stroll.  It was off by 1/2 mile for vigorous walking.  It was off over a mile when I jogged 3 miles.  It even misses steps.  Several days in a row, I ran on the treadmill, the same speed, the same distance, and the same time.  The step counter read vastly different several days in a row.  Needless to say, I have been dissappointed and am looking for a new product.  Any suggestions?

Nothing but problems from the minute I took it out of the box.  Not one of my computers could maintain a connection.  When I spoke to Linksys they could not resolve the issue.  They suggested I replace the router. I originially bought here but ran to a local store to get a second one. SAME ISSUE.  now I have to return two of these pieces of junk.  Linksys tried to have me shut down on of the dual bands and I asked why I would do that since that is why I replaced my original router in the first place. I am now running on my original router.  DO NOT BUY A 610N.

Am I ever GLAD I read these reviews.Looks like Intuit is up to their old games again.Remember the Rootkit anti-piracy program with TurboTax in 2003?I certainly don't blame the software engineers (Dilberts) - - they have to kowtow to (Bad Name 1) pointy haired bosses who derive new ways to HOSE their customers.  Now TurboTax 2008 will charge you $9.95 to print more than one tax return!! And the SAME (Bad Name 2) at Intuit have taken GIANT steps backwards with QuickBooks 2009.WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH INTUIT.Looks like I'm going to have to go back to TaxCut this year, and give a serious look at SWITCHING TO PEACHTREE for my Accounting needs.I've already decided NEVER to buy another GM automobile (after my 98 GrandPrix GTP spontaneously started an ENGINE FIRE - a KNOWN defect with NO RECALL WARNING).  This is AT LEAST the second time we've been HOSED by Intuit - - time to THROW the BA-----S OUT.So how do I REALLY feel??  :-)Merlin(Post edited to remove the (Bad Names)  :-)

With linux and without windows - I got the black one.Twice the RAM and twice the disk space - duhh. But if you want to slow things down with Windows - buy this one - install windoze - and have the faster box.Voice recognition is a lot of fun. And this linux package with office, mail, wifi, firefox and free patches and upgrades - means you quit paying after you buy it. But if you choose windows you are just beginning your buying spree.I like the programming tools of perl, python, ruby and java - access to the command line with a ctl-alt-t sets up the terminal.I plan to slip this into my backpack (2 pounds) and surf my way between large cities in europe by train. The small keyboard takes time - I am 6'3" have large hands, and am up to about 30 wpm.What I really like is the 6+ hours batter life. I put this on my headboard and when I want the net, I just reach back and boot - about 30 seconds. With wifi I am up and surfing in a lot less than a minute. When I have done what I wanted, it will shut down in about 20 seconds.It is about as easy as reaching for a book to read.You can't go wrong with this little linux jewel - if you want everything - and have the ability to travel easily too - 5 stars *****

I have done alot of workout DVDs, and this one is definitely tough - especially the arm workout.  However, as some of the other reviews mention, there are literally no cues or explanations of how to properly do the exercises.  This makes it difficult to follow which ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the workout and is very frustrating.  I also think it is unrealistic that in her interview she states "she really doesn't want you doing anything else" besides her mat and cardio workouts.

At almost a quarter apiece, diapers cost a fortune. But having tested numerous brands on our three kids (read below), we're still loyal to Cruisers.We've tried Pampers Baby Dry, Cruisers, Luvs, Huggies, Target's store brand, White Cloud (from Wal-Mart), and store brand at Meier (our local supermarket).My overall experience has been best with Pampers Cruisers, for our boy-girl twins and our older son, who used to drink over 40 ounces a day and whiz like a horse.Here's my experience with different brands.Target's store brand just didn't hold as much liquid and weren't as soft as the name brands. Meier store brand also leaked.Huggies Supreme felt nice and were stretchy, but they left little gel pellets on the skin even when we changed diapers frequently. Plus they ran small, so we had to buy a larger size (which come fewer to a package and thus cost more per diaper).Pampers Baby Dry didn't seem to absorb as quickly or as much as the Cruisers, which for us are pretty leak proof unless my husband changes the diapers (and leaves an entire half of the rear-end uncovered -- I'm talking an entire cheek hanging out).Luvs (which are made by the same company as Pampers) absorbed a little less and had a funny smell to me when the babies wet them -- and they also didn't come as high up the waist as the Cruisers in the same size. That meant that the waist area of the clothing sometimes ended up wet. And did I mention the slight odor?Now for the White Cloud. This brand's baby diapers also fell short of the Cruisers. BUT for pull-ups for our older son, White Cloud are fantastic. (Pampers pull-ups often ripped at the sides while we were just putting them on, and they aren't Velcro, so they CANNOT be refastened. We loved Huggies pull-ups, but the White Cloud ones are cheaper and are as stretchy and absorbent as the Huggies.)Between Target and Meier's sales and coupons, and Amazon's subscribe and save, I pay on average between twenty-three cents and a quarter per size 4 Cruiser. My most recent 116-count box at Target cost about twenty-three cents per diaper (that's including tax). My most recent 100-count box with special discounts from Amazon ran me 25 cents per diaper. That's also what the 140-count box usually costs me through subscribe and save.

Two things to note.  The product worked well for about a week then nothing.  We spent 9.00 on a new battery, still nothing.  IMPORTANT TO NOTE.  Amazon will not accept this item in return due to the spray that it comes with.

Surviving a heart attack 2-1/2 years ago belatedly made me a real believer in the 10,000 steps a day concept, thanks to the staff in the Coronary Heart Disease Reversal Program at the UC Davis Med Center.  Daily exercise is one important component of their program, and a pedometer is a great tool to help you evaluate how much exercise you're getting, not just in 45 minutes on a treadmill or exercise bike at the gymn, but in your daily activities around your home, yard, and work.  Using a pedometer daily can give you some surprising insights about your life-style.  Who knew, for example, that shopping can qualify as exercise when there's walking involved?  And insights often lead to positive changes.I bought, used, and discarded a half-dozen cheap, inaccurate, poorly-designed pedometers.  I would run 3 miles and find the pedometer had recorded 92 steps.  I had clips break, cases split from being dropped, I jabbed myself on sharp case corners when bending over.   Then I found the Omron HJ-112 at Amazon and it immediately stood out above all the others.The HJ-112 is accurate -- within 1-2%, based on my experience.  Accuracy with my other pedometers was more like 5-10%.  And the HJ-112's accuracy is largely independent of wearing position -- clipped on a belt or shoe, hanging from a lanyard, loose in a shirt or pants pocket, it really doesn't matter.  Most other brands need to be clipped at a very specific hip position to get accurate counts.  The HJ-112 can be easily used all day.  When you're exercising, you'll probably want to use its clip or lanyard.  But pedometers don't really go with business attire so when you're at work or out in public, just pop it out of it's belt clip and put it in a pocket.  Omron says a purse will also do -- I'm skeptical -- but a fanny pack certainly works.  The clip is quite secure, and the clip attachment to the pedometer itself is excellent: very easy to insert/remove and in two years of use, I've never had it accidently pop off.  The belt clip can work itself loose with repeated flexing if it's sandwiched between two surfaces like abdomen/thigh -- for example, squatting over pulling weeds.  I learned this first hand while squatting doing repairs on the roof of a two-story house. The clip pulled off and the pedometer fell 20 feet onto concrete.  It didn't survive.  I chaulked it up as a life-lesson and ordered a new one from Amazon.  Now when I'm doing that kind of work, I try to remember to carry the HJ-112 in my pocket.  I have dropped the HJ-112 onto concrete and other hard surfaces from more reasonable heights up to 6-7 feet, with no ill effects -- the belt clip is soft, flexible plastic and a pretty-good energy dissipator.  I regularly run 3-4 miles, and I've never had the clip come loose. The best feature of the HJ-112 to me is it's Auto-Reset, which I didn't really appreciate until I used the unit for a couple of days.  Each night at midnight, it stores the previous day's step count in memory and resets the current step count to zero.  It stores a week's worth of step counts, which are retrieved with the Memory button, though it doesn't store any of the other computed info (Calories, Miles, etc.).  This really makes it easy to use every day.  No more frustration when you realize mid-afternoon that you forgot to reset the pedometer that morning.  And since it has a clock, it's also able to evaluate steps per minute, which it uses to report "Aerobic steps": 60 steps/minute or higher, or 10 minutes of continuous walking.The display is easy to read, the clock is remarkably accurate -- better than my iPod's -- though it doesn't handle Daylight Savings Time changes automatically.  The buttons are nicely sized with a good, tactile feel.  The battery lasts 18 months or so, and is easily replaced.I recommend this product.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray] (Blu-ray)
      

When I think of the nature shows I used to watch there were many short clips of things like a leopard running behind a gazelle. One of the best things about this series is their use of modern helicopter-mounted camera systems allowing them to film very long action sequences the likes of which I haven't seen before. The show's large budget and the filmmaker's patience and determination also allowed them to get some impressive footage from remote places.David Attenborough's voice is pleasing, but I think the actual content of his narration could have been better. Watch out as some US versions feature Sigourney Weaver as a narrator, which may or may not be your cup of tea.This series is one of those rare items that I think justifies High Definition, so you might want to wait until the HD DVD vs. Blu-Ray war is settled before buying a HD version.Lastly, I have to mention I couldn't help feeling a bit sad while watching the series because at the rate our planet is going down the drain many of these natural wonders will be gone soon. The HD version might be something to keep for your grandchildren so you can show them what your generation wiped out for ever. Perhaps some viewers today will feel compelled to become "greener" after watching this? I hope so...P.S.: It's unfortunate that the "making of" documentary is missing from the HD versions. You might want to rent that disc because it's revealing to see how the series was made.

***UPDATE***  No longer the best.  Was the best though.This is the best typing program you could ask for.  It lets you choose your lesson and youre able to go anywhere in the program whenever you want.  This is good for reviewing parts that youre not ready to go past yet.  Everything is set up how it should be, i've been learning very quick from this program.  It's literally 10 times better than mavis beacon which is a piece of krap.  Mavis beacon makes you start from the beginning, and will not let you go back or review lessons, also the design and format are very poor, the word for it is "garbagey".  All other programs I've tried have come way short of this one too.

So everyone knows that gadgets usually last about 4-5 years until they really start to "act up" and basically fail.  Fun fact: Netgear charges you $35 to call them for help after their bogus 90 day warranty.  I've never heard of anyone having problems besides hook up with the netgear products until they are a few years old. So basically: NETGEAR DOESN'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND THEY WANT TO RIP YOU OFF SO DON'T BUY IT UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THESE THINGS AFTER YOUR 90 "WARRANTY" HAS EXPIRED!!!!!

Originally purchased one for family who live in a rural area, using bottled gas to power their oven.  Their oven takes forever to heat.  While waiting to hand deliver our present, our toaster oven went and we purchased one for ourselves.It is phenomenal.  The convection saves time and does a wonderful job.It takes approximately 5 minutes or so to heat.Using it as a regular oven is a bonus.  Less energy and always quicker.It can also supplement your regular oven on big cooking days.The toaster settings get some getting used to but now I am quite pleased.  The broiler produced wonderful lamb chops.The control panel is a joy to operate.

I purchased this external hard drive so that I could back up data from an older computer before purchasing my new computer.

I suspect most of these reviews were written shortly after buying the product. But god forbid 6 months down the line you install another card into your network.I bought all netgear stuff (router, PC card and PCMCIA card) to satisfy networking needs, so there would not be any issue about "oh you gotta call linksys for that problem" type of thing). I swear these guys put in code to make it stop working when the warranty is up. I know it sounds conspiratorial, but for 3 items this happens? come on!First the router, looks nice. But why are the download speeds a fraction of the speed of the wireless connections? Can't get that question answered becuase my warranty is up even though these miserable speeds only came about when i installed the new cards.I install a PCMCIA card on a laptop. Works good, but now my PC with a wireless card in it failed...guess what.. my warranty is up on that card too. It fails just when i install the laptop card? and i cant get help on that, becuase (everyone say it....): my warranty is up.Knowledge base help is useless, ask anyone. email support is slow and they just give you canned answers which is useless. Netgear has truly terrible technical support, and it would be nice to see a company treat their customers in a way that would make them want to buy their products in the future. I know I wont be buying any more netgear stuff.Buy equipment from a reliable company. Linksys (why did I switch? Why oh why?).

Like ususal, the characters are very well developed and the stories and CG is very good.  The last episode (Pegasus) of this set will definitely make you go out to get Season 2.5.  My recommendation:  Get 2.5 right away and watch Pegasus on 2.5 because it has more information than the Pegasus episode on 2.0.

I thought I was doing the right thing by my cats when I brought this Petmate water fountain home.  Wrong.  Right from the start, the pump has sounded like a small jet aircraft at take off.  I've done it all -- dismantle and reassemble the pump, dismantle and reassemble the entire unit, drain and refill with cool clear distilled water.  No.  It is too loud to use near human habitation, and it is too loud for the cats to bother approaching it for a drink.  And as someone observed here, it fills with junk and clogs in a heartbeat.  Nope.  I am resigned to leaving a faucet dripping and a bathroom door ajar around the clock to make sure our two cats get enough fresh water.  This product has been a bust.

This little gadget got my teeth and gums cleaner than I ever thought possible. There was just one drawback--it was making my gums recede! Used it for 2 weeks, 2 or 3 times a day or more (the fresh clean feeling got quite addictive). I actually felt better. I had gingivitus and slight periodontitis. But soon my teeth were getting quite sensitive and to my horror I realized it was indeed destoying my gums. It says in the instructions to talk to your dentist first before using if you have gum desease which I have not, perhaps he will know if its possible to use safely. It also says to not touch the tip directly to your gums, indeed, as far away as possible but this is difficult since then its harder to keep the mouth completely shut & water sprays out. And you can't see what you're doing either since your mouth is closed. Anyway since using I have learned how important it is to keep ones mouth clean--plaque forms at the tooth gum boundary 20 minutes after eating & the bacteria double every hour and enter into your bloodstream through the gums and cause all kinds of problems.

I have two short-haired cats in a small apartment and, between vacuuming sessions, I am always on the lookout for hair-bunnies creeping up in corners or underneath counters.I wasn't sure if my cats had enough hair for the FURminator to be any more effective than my other grooming tools.However, I have been all-out awed by its performance.  My other grooming tools (which I thought were pretty good) just weren't pulling out the dandery undergrowth that makes their coat look dull and unkempt.  I saw an immediate improvement in their coat texture - much silkier.  My cats haven't been picky about grooming tools in the past but this was the first time I used something with metal teeth.  Not a problem, they sit in their spots and happily bat their tails throughout the entire grooming session.The FURminator is my hands-down favorite purchase of 2008.  The amount of fur whisps I've seen on my hardwood floor has been reduced to nearly nothing.  No hairbunny surprises in ages.I was surprised to find something on Amazon with more than 400 reviews and such high ratings.  It really is as good as the hype and well-worth the price.

I've had this appliance since just before Thanksgiving but only able to fully use it twice.  It's very cool the way the egg poacher works with the muffin toaster. BUT when I washed the egg poacher cup, a good bit of teflon came off. (I tried a second time and my poached egg was full of black teflon flakes.)  The appliance came with a notice that implored you to please call the Back to Basics if there is a problem (rather than the retailer) so I did.I was told they would send a replacement cup immediately. I can boil eggs in it which is great but you can't toast at the same time so either your toast or your eggs get cold while waiting for the other.  As I approached my 30 day return period, I called back and was told that the cups were being redesigned and they would send one out immediately.Today (now 64 days after the first call) I called again and was told that my cup was mailed 10 days ago (but only 7 business days so they won't even discuss tracing or resending until next week).  They mailed it from Utah.  I live in Seattle. I am so not happy with their service, their attitude and now I'm even getting annoyed at the appliance.  Hopefully, no one else will have this problem.  But, just in case...

I bought the Flip Ultra a few days ago, and I haven't been able to put it down.  Like most parents, I have a miniDV camcorder, but I haven't been using it to take as many movies of my kids as I should have, so I bought this to keep on me at (almost) all times.  Here is what I have found so far:Pros:  It's truly pocket sized.  It starts up in seconds, and operation could not be any simpler.  The video seems slightly better than the movie mode on my digital camera, and the sound is better.  Because it's cheap (I paid sixty bucks), I'm not worried about damaging it, and as long as you are somewhat aware that there is a lens, there is not much to break anyway.  The software, once it's working, is also very simple, and yes, the program outputs normal *.avi files.  Indoor light makes acceptable videos.  Schoolroom lighting was perfect.  Outdoors, when the sun was low in the sky, I got a lot of washout (to be fair, it would have been tough for any camera).Cons:  It's hard to make a non-shaky video.  There is no Electronic Image Stabilization or anything like it, and the thing is so light that it's tough to hold it steady.  That little screen on the back is your only indicator of whether or not you are holding it steady.  There is no memory card slot, just internal memory.  I had some annoying problems with the software, which is built in to the camera.  The first time you plug it in, it installs onto the computer.  It immediately recognized that there was an update available, so I downloaded that and installed it.  The problem came when the computer wanted to update the camera - my camera was filled with video, so it said it would do it later.  Fine.  I removed my files, fired the program back up - and it installed the update to the camera.  Then I was barraged with requests to reinstall the update - constantly - when the camera was plugged into the computer.  I had to uninstall the software and reinstall from the camera.  Now, it still wants to re-install the program when it gets plugged in, but it only asks once now, and I can live with that little annoyance.So know what you are getting - your normal camcorder will take better videos, but you probably won't have it in your pocket when something spontaneous happens.

The whole concept of Flip Video is simplicity. Open the box, drop in the included (regular) batteries, shoot, review, download, done! The camera works great!! If you're looking to become the next Spielberg, or you want to film an 8-hour epic that you plan on boring your family and friends with, this camera is NOT for you. But if you want a fun and easy to use device that fits in your pocket, you'll love this. The video quality is very good and makes great videos in a normally lit room, with no need for one of those spotlights that blind the subject. You also have the option of saving still pictures from your videos, and picture quality is good. Emailing your videos is also easy. There is no software disk or manual needed. Cables are even included so you can watch them on your TV. Even the product registration is simple. All you do is send an email to the company with your particulars and it's done. No surveys and boxes to click and unclick.I use a MacBook, and I did experience some downloading issues initially. But Flip technical support is superb! I received a response and solution to my problem within hours of sending an email.  I rated this highly because of the simplicity, quality, fun factor and excellent technical support. If this is what you want, get a Flip. If you plan on filming the next Hollywood blockbuster, spend big bucks on another, expensive alternative.

I purchased this aluminum MacBook to replace the white plastic MacBook I acquired in June of 2006. I enjoyed using my white plastic MacBook, but when I learned about the manufacturing process used to construct the new aluminum MacBook, I realized it was time for an upgrade!I have read the unenthusiastic reviews despairing the removal of a Firewire port in the aluminum MacBook. I certainly understand that to some people Firewire connectivity is essential. I am not one of those people. I have never used the Firewire port in my white plastic MacBook. I guess I'm just behind the times; I don't even own a video camera.I have also read the negative comments about the glossy screen. I like the glossy screen because everything looks a little sharper as compared to the matte screen of my white plastic MacBook.The new MacBook has a glorious aluminum case and the computer is significantly faster than my 1.83Ghz 2gb RAM white plastic MacBook.This machine is a winner..

As I know, the books Stephanie Meyer wrote was directed to a "teen audience"...maybe that was her demographic in the begining, but in the end, the story of Bella and Edward and scored across the board. My grand daughter read the stories following me...my daughter and then my grandson. Our ages range from 16 to 59. We all fell in love with the stories and the movie. Just to let anyone know who may read this...both of my grandchildren are 4.0 students and my daughter and I are both professionals. We all have many friends of various ages and work stations who have read and enjoyed the books as well as the movie...So..it is not just a "teen movie."In addition we are looking forward to the sequel New Moon and hope that Weitz does the exceptional job that Hardwicke did. When you have such a detailed story how do you pick the primary pieces and try to fit them together without having a six hour movie. I think that she did a exceptional job and Weitz will really have his work cut out for him in the sequel.As you can well ascertain, I am a fan of the books and movie, and look forward to more work by Meyer, Hardwicke and the beautiful young cast of Twilight.Sincerely,Linda M.

After reading the other reviews, I took a risk and bought this product to help restore peace and quiet in our back yard. Two large neighbor dogs go insane any time we move in our own yard. After asking politely for help from the dog owners, we took matters in our own hands.We hung the "bird house" from a tree near the fence where the offending pooches perform their annoying chorus. While installing, both ran over, ready to start the concert and - "What's this?" Both looked confused and immediately ran to the other end of their yard. Since that time, they not only have stopped barking, they don't even come to our side of the fence anymore! Peace at last!!Well worth it; works like magic.

Borrowed this camera from a friend to compare to my 3-year-old HDV-based Sony. Here's what I found:1- Shoots great HD. Easy to use and very functional.2- Plugs into my intel-based iMac via usb. Transfers easily, but TWICE as slowly as from my Sony.3- Since the format is being converted to allow the files to play nice with iMovie, the end result is that the AVCHD is dumbed down a bit, just as with HDV. Side by side comparison of the final product (DVDs made in iDVD) is that they both end up looking just about the same.So, I'm sticking with my antique HDV tape-based rig and waiting for someone to come out with a consumer HD camera that creates a format compatible with Quicktime without having to modify the files.Are you listening Canon? Make a camera that allows me (and everyone else) to drag and drop the digital files into iMovie or FCP and i'll be first in line to buy it!!

I have two young dogs (Devil Dogs) and one older dog (Mr. Perfect), which all love the beds.  They are placed in the yard under a tree and by the pool.  When "the boys" want to take it easy, they go directly to their new beds.  The beds look great and are very easy to clean.

I'd wanted to see the movie for some time now and was given the book as a gift. The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted. I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book. There were heartwarming moments and I shed a tear or two but all in all I'm glad I didn't purchase the movie. I actually could have waited until it aired o cable.

The monitor is very easy to use and I like the guest and memory features.  The only drawback to this product is that I feel I can never get the cuff tight enough around my arm.  I wish it had a better closure feature.  Overall, I am very happy with this monitor.

I love the pedometer.  Easy to use.  BUT I should have heeded the warnings the first few times the clip fell off with the pedometer.  Getting in and out of my car, etc.  Now it's lost.  Don't trust the clip when it's directly on your waist band.  Maybe it works better on a belt.

This review is from: Australia (DVD)
      

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen -- would have given it a NEGATIVE 4-star rating if it had been possible to do so. It was so offensibly bad, I stopped watching 20 minutes into it.  Will put the DVD out in the spring subdivision garage sale and hope some unsuspecting chump will be willing to pay 25 cents for it.

I bought this computer for web and email while on the road. I am totally pleased with my purchase and would recommend it for everyone who needs a small work computer for the road.I've upgraded the memory to 2G and added an office program and several other small office solutions programs. The speed and comfort of running several programs at once is great, no problems at all. The battery life is beyond anything I've experienced, a good 6+ hours. The connectivity options are super and I've used them all without a hitch. The key board actually fits my hands better than the standard, and I haven't yet had any problems with typing.I love the 10" screen and the resolution qualities are super, along with the easy controls. Taking this thru security at many airports is a breeze, as it fits nicely in my backpack. Compared to the 14" that I use to carry the Samsung is a dream come true.I agree you won't like this computer if you load it up with High demand video or picture programs, but to go and download videos and pics, this is a great computer.The samsung NC10,for what it was created to do,is the best of the mini computer sector. For the price you can't get a better computer.

I purchased this router without reading reviews on Amazon or other websites. As a result, I have been through a time consuming nightmare. I was diligent and meticulous in  following  the installation instructions out of the box.  Regardless, my computer's browser did not interface with the router. I called customer support and they told me I needed to download "new firmware" for the product. This is mind boggling. Why should I have to go through the process of downloading "new firmware" for a "new router"? Maybe I am missing something here but shouldn't the "new router" have workable "firmware" out of the box?  I am an attorney not a computer scientist.  What the heck is "firmware" anyway??  For the next 2 hours,  I was on the phone with customer support downloading and extracting zip files, cutting and pasting files into the address bar, opening and closing multiple windows, dragging and dropping files,  going into dos prompt, doing ipconfig, pingable ip etc. For an average user to run this crazy gauntlet of  complicated networking & computer science is too much.  I am a busy professional and don't have time for crazy games in data communications. I need to turn the key and get going.   After downloading and installing the "firmware"  and spending hours on the phone my computer and laptop were finally up and running.  I thought fantastic. I can finally get some work done.  I did some work and accessed a couple of legal sites.  The next day I am in an important meeting and need to access some files. My laptop is not connecting to the internet. I go into the next room and jump on my desktop. I can access the Internet but things are acting funny.  Web pages load slowly and  I can't access some sites (i.e. amazon.com).   Sometimes I can't type text into the URL address bar and when I do it won't delete.  In short, my entire system started acting very strange. I  called LinkSys back and they told me that the new firmware installed the previous day became "corrupt".  "How can that be?" I asked.  I didn't do anything to it.  The LinkSys rep. responded that he didn't know and that we would have to go through the process again. No sir, we will not be going through the process again.   I am returning the router to Best Buy for an exchange and will not get a LinkSys.  If  Best Buy does not take back the router then we will all meet in court for: false advertising breach of contract, consumer fraud, punitive damages, loss of  fiduciary productivity. I can think of many other things to talk about. I might get a 100K out of the whole thing!  I'm ready to fight these LinkSys (...)

After reading all of these reviews I ran to my local BJ's wholesale and bought my first Keurig......It was defective.  It vibrated my mug off of it made horrible noises and even worse made terrible weak coffee.  So I took a break.  For mothers day my husband bought me the Keurig B60 to replace my existing Senseo.  The machine does not viberate like the last nor does it make horrible noises but the coffee is still not very good (I tried the variety pack or at least 8 of them.)On the other hand my Senseo broke after 1 1/2 I called customer service and without any questions they sent me a replacement Senseo and free return shipping.  The coffee tastes 1000 times better also (medium and dark roast mainly the flavored ones not so great).   It is funny because my family and friends all think I hate strong coffee but the Keurig seems weak to me on the smallest cup setting while using the darkest roasts.I love my coffee but the Senseo pods (used to be $3.85 not $4.10 at walmart) are twice as cheap, have better customer service (from reviews), and ultimately taste better for less then $70 without a coupon which you can find almost anywhere (e-bay, craigslist etc)  The keurig does look pretty at least while the Senseo just looks like it belongs...at least in my kitchen.

I have had trouble with several sanas products.  Though their mp3 players are inexpensive and inoative, in the end you get what you pay for.  A product that doesn't last and poor customer service.  Just try gettint though to them to fix a product.  They count on you just giving up becuase it isn't worth the trouble.  When you buy a cheap product like a sansa, you expect them to be thow away, but when they break in a month, it really pisses you off.  I have thrown away three different sansa mp3 players that lasted less than three months.  It just wasn't worth the trouble to try to deal with customer service.

I used Turbotax to do my taxes for several years only to find out that it was calculating my taxes incorrectly and I owed thousands more.  Years later I am still trying to pay it off.  And because of their stringent rules that require you to register and report it within 30 days and even if I satisfied that they'll only pay the initial penalties and interest.  Would of been better off doing my taxes without the software.

I bought this product so my cat would have cleaner/fresher water to drink instead of the standard bowl of water. I work long hours and not intentional I'd forget to change her water bowl everyday. Her water bowl after about 2 days would be dirty with food and slimey. The machine is bulky and noisy. I've never seen her use it, the equipment still gets slimey, however there isn't any food in it, so I don't think she is using it. Unless I'm doing something wrong, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

This show is the best.  I really don't need to say more but I will.  This is by far the best show on TV right now and this DVD set is a credit to the series.  I will admit that some of the episodes of series 2.5 are a little lackluster and strained the overall product more than make up for a few less than stellar episodes.  Extras like the commentaries, extended Pegasus cut, Deleted scenes, and the R&D skits make this DVD buy worth every penny.  This is not a rent, it is most definitely a buy, keep, cherish and witch over and over and over and over.  OK maybe that's a little over the top but it is worth dropping a few bucks to get it.

This gate works really well for all level surfaces.  We found it didn't work well at the top of stairs, however, because you need a little leverage to press the foot pedal enough to open the gate.  Unfortunately, if you're on the stair below the gate, you have to lift your leg too high to really get the leverage to open it.  I would highly recommend it for all doorways, however.  We love it!

I really wanted a product like this, however it doesn't work. I took it out of the box and charged it up. It kept shutting off before being fully charged. it took four attempts to get it charged.When i turned it on it either freezes or shows a screen full of static. no image. have to hold the power button down to shut down. even a reset (paper clip in the reset hole) doesn't make it better.this is really a piece of garbage and it's only backed by a 90 day warranty. I suggest you stay away from this one.

I was excited about this new router, thinking that with the two large antennas, it would give great range.  Unfortunately I still have not been able to test the range.  For starters, the power cord was dead on arrival.  After searching for about a half an hour, I was finally able to find a phone number for support.  After three different phone calls, and being transferred to numerous different people and long hold times, I gave up on getting a new power cord and scavenged one from an old router I had.  Once I was able to power-up, I connected to the router via wires no problem,however, I was unable to get the wireless side to work.  After two more calls to customer service and over 2 hours of trying to talk it through with them, I was told that my only option would be to pay $9.99 so tech support could log onto my computer to try and fix the problem.  At that point I decided that it just wasn't worth it to keep throwing good time and money at this problem.  In reality the only option I had left was to send the router back.  I realize that sometimes products are defective and I don't judge linksys  negatively for what may have been an isolated incident.  However, there is no way that the incredibly poor and useless customer support that I received was isolated.

First of all, here is the manual, because this thing wins the award for the least intuitive device I've ever used:http://www.smarthome.com/manuals/61860.pdfIt does what it says what it will do until your pet figures out how to "steal" food.  My cat is quite dumb so it took her a couple months to figure out that she could reach her paw up in the food tumbler and swipe food outI'm now quite happy though because I drilled two holes above the food hole, put some fat screws in there.  Now her arms are bigger than the hole.  The manufacturer should have figured this out for us though so we wouldn't have to modify our own product.  (there may be a newer model, i didn't bother checking).  I've had this for about 10 months and all the batteries work fine, so that's nice.Overall, if it exists, I would recommend buying another product that doesn't have the food theft factor.

I am really pleased with the Cuisinart DCC-1200.  I have had it for about a month and I love it.  We got the black and stainless model and it looks great on the counter.This coffee maker is easy to use and is constructed well.  I spent a few minutes reading the manual and find it easy to use all of its features.  I like how hot the coffee is - hotter than any other maker I have tried.I highly recommend the DCC-1200.

We've used the sleepsack since our daughter was born.  No worries about blankets getting wrapped near her head/mouth.  The last few months we haven't used one as it was summer but now that it is cooling off (and we found her with her blanket bunched under her head half covering her face) we decided it's time to buy more (in larger sizes now that she is 16 months old).It definitely brings peace of mind regarding safety and that your baby is nice and warm (but not too warm thanks for the armless sack) during the night.  Definitely worth the money!

I bought this for my son who is nuts over the Transformers toys.  It didn't even hold his attention for 5 minutes.  The husband and I tried to watch it also but were bored to tears.  If you like sci-fi type stuff you may be able to withstand the deluge of laser and things but we were not.

Remember when Microsoft told us that Vista was so much better than XP and 2000, but those who bought it discovered that even though everything was much prettier, it took them twice the amount of time to do basic things they could do before? It seems that Intuit is doing the exact same thing. I was a very, very happy user of Quicken Home and Business 2006. In fact, I have been a happy user of Quicken since it was sold on 5 1/4" disks for the Apple II. Intuit started telling me that automatic downloads from financial institutions would no longer work, and that I had to upgrade to 2009 in order to keep that feature. Being a computer programmer, I know this is a lot of bull. What happened was, someone in the marketing department discovered that people weren't buying 2009. So what do they do? Planned obsolecence. Start disabling perfectly good features in 2006 so that everyone needs to fork over $80 to buy the new version. I happily forked over the money. After all, like I said, I was perfectly happy with 2006, and I figured that 2009 would be an improvement.I had always been very happy with Quicken's user interface. The problem is, it seems that since 2006 it seems that they fired all their UI people. The new software is "pretty". It's got "round edges" like modern software is supposed to have. But just one small example. The accounts list on the left of the screen can't be resized past 242 pixels. So if I have an account that reads "American Express - Starwoods Preferred Card", it now reads "American Express - Starwoo". Yes, I can rename the account, but why should I? In 2006, I could resize the panel just fine, thank you very much.Another thing that boggles my mind. There is a 2-pixel vertical line to the left of that screen. It took me about 10 minutes to realize this is supposed to be a scroll bar. I am no UI expert, but this breaks every single usability rule in the book. In 2006, there was a perfectly fine traditional scrollbar. But some idiot designer decided along the lines that usability wasn't as important as keeping the beautiful rounded corners pretty. This is just talking about two little features. Multiply this by about 200, and you'll know the frustration you'll be facing when you install this. There are dozens and dozens of buttons that I'll never use, but now every time I open Quicken I'll have to navigate through them to do what I want. This is the kind of thing that happens when a company becomes a monopoly. They lose touch with what made them successful in the first place, and a bunch of hack executives try to "improve" their product, but end up destroying it because they don't try to understand what made it successful in the first place. In Quicken's case, it was simplicity, lack of bloat, a great user interface, and a product that worked. I hate to say it, but Intuit "jumped the shark" with this one. They dropped the ball with Turbotax, and now they're doing the same with this once-fine product.

When I first got this eeepc, I was very impressed with it.  Great portability, good boot time.  I didn't worry about the small keyboard, though it is inconvenient when trying to type out an angry review...pardon any typos.  The  problem comes when trying to watch videos.  The included mplayer is horrible.  My videos are slow and skip like mad.  At first I thought it was the laptop, but found out it was just a buggy player.  "No problem, I thought...I can download a different one."  I was referred by several people to VLC, and I thought it would be a simple act of downloading the program, double-clicking to install, and watching movies.  No.  FAR FROM IT.  In  order to install VLC, I had to go to an online chatroom to find a linux guru, who patiently coached me through the install process.  I had to open up a text file, add some ftp addresses to it, run some crazy linux code to download packages, update something, then install....it was like a programming language!  Finally, VLC worked for me....until this morning, when I saw that Firefox needed to be updated.  So I clicked on update, and now VLC no longerworks.  I went online to see that everyone else was having the same problem.  I can't even reverse the update, like I can with Windows.I've had it.  I am now forced to purchase Windows XP and install it, if I can, JUST SO I CAN WATCH MOVIES ON MY EEEPC!!!!!  I thought I was getting the good deal...a bigger SSD with Linux...no problem when all I'll do is get online, check email, and watch movies right?  WRONG!Get the 16GB SSD with Windows XP, and buy a 4GB flash drive.  Linux is worthless to people like me who don't know how to use it.

Wish I had this coffee maker years ago.  I have a Senseo single serve coffee maker, which I purchased several years ago.  I have enjoyed it but it has always been a bit messy when disposing of the pod after each use.  That is the reason I have never placed it on the night stand.The Keurig B60 is residing on my night stand.  It enables me to have a fresh cup of my favorite coffee each work day morning.  Because it only takes a few minutes for it to brew a fresh hot cup of joe while I am trying to wake up each morning, I don't have to stagger into the kitchen and stand there, bleery eyed, waiting for the Senseo to do its job.No matter where you place the B60, you will always get a fresh, hot cup or mug of your favorite K-Cup coffee in minutes.

I'm a sucker for promotions on Oprah, and when miss Paltrow came on the show talking about Tracy Anderson's workout, I became curious. I am a fit person but at 5'2" I bulk up really easily whenever I weight train. I've always just had to stick with cardio if I want to lose weight, but still it never keeps me very toned. My wedding is in 3 months, and my problem area is my arms, so I figured I'd give it a shot and purchased the DVD. It's my only workout DVD that I own and in 2 weeks, I've received more compliments on my figure than I could have imagined. I noticed that I'm leaner in the mirror, and my shoulders have more definition, but I didn't think it was noticeable to anyone else. The feedback has been very encouraging, and the results are pretty amazing. I do the workout 5-6 times a week first thing in the morning. At first, my form wasn't very good... the leg and arm workouts are brutal. But after a week, I noticed that I'm able to control more, and really get into it. For the first time this morning I actually completed the arm workout without stopping, which was a huge accomplishment for me. There are some annoying things that she does, like not really count or keep track of how many reps she does, and one side may get a few more reps than the other. So I have just learned to alternate... one day I start with my left, and the next it's my right, so hopefully that evens out. I would recommend this workout DVD for anyone who is really looking to tone up without bulking. I would not say it's the only form of exercise you need to lose weight, you still need to do cardio and eat well, but I'm pretty sure you'll be amazed with the results in a short time.

I read the box over and over to make sure I understood what capabilities this drive had besides just being a large hard drive.  The data syncronization, backup and versioning capabilities were the biggest selling points for me. The device was touted as a 'Data Mover' rather than a drive.  I was very disappointed to find out that the software that does everything the box promises is a trial version.  Plan to spend another $30 if you want any of those capabilities.  It also seems cheap that an eSata cable is not included.  Otherwise, the drive is quiet, looks cool with the lighting and does not get as hot as other reviews have indicated.  The drive is good, but don't buy it for the Data Mover functions promised on the box.  The advertising seems very misleading.

This review is from: Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series (DVD)
      

In this film, one can see snap shots of a number of rare and near extinct animals.  BBC has utilized this opportunity to emphasize how human activities has endangered all sort of living organisms on earth.  This message is loud and clear.  It is a fabolous film to show during family gathering or to be used as educational tool for kids.  Different chapters are organized by habitates: deserts, rainforest, tundra, poles, caves...etc.  This organization allows the DVD to merge the knowledge of animals together with knowledge of geograhy into one relatively coherent film.  It might be a bit hard for kids to follow and to absorb 100% of material though.  I appreciate and the seperate part of documentation that details the challenges the crew faced.  The script in this part is a bit too hard sell for my taste, hence one less star.Haven't view the discovery channel or national geography films that are similar, so no comment about which one is better.  However, with this one alone, I highly recommend this, especially if you have a high definition TV.

I received this camera as a gift to record my son's 1st birthday. Out of the box, the camera was easy-to-use (as promised) for what is basically a flash drive with video software. The buttons, screen and menu actions are pretty straightforward. This is where the good stuff ends.I hooked the camera up to my iMac. The camera was not recognized. I hooked it up to my Powerbook. The camera was not recognized.I emailed support with a very specific description of what I had done and the machine setup. The first (clearly canned) response from support were instructions for Windows. Not helpful. I emailed back to say as much and they sent me instructions for Mac that did not work and they (again) ignored the crux of the problem. The camera is not recognized. In order to run the firmware update (which I'm guessing is supposed to fix everything), it has to be able to recognize the camera. Strike two for support.Out of pure frustration, I plugged it into my PC laptop. The device is recognized, but when trying to run the firmware update, it errors out with an actual message that says to contact the manufacturer. Really?! The messed up part of this is that they actually thought about this error message, which means they knew this was going to happen in a fair amount of instances.Overall, I'm not only disappointed, I'm frustrated and annoyed by their poor customer support. Clearly they have the marketing thing down ... how about providing some better customer support. Or at least reading customers emails before they respond to them. I'm returning this item with my son's 1st birthday video that I won't ever see. How sad is that? :: Update :: Customer service did replace my Flip and the replacement worked just fine. The only issue I've had since is a need (common to all external drive-type media) is to make sure you've emptied the trash if you've deleted videos from the device directly from your computer. After more use, the video quality isn't super high quality, but it is really useful for upload to video sites. It also doesn't handle movement well, but it's definitely worth it for what it is.

I once had a Fresh Flow and it quickly got dirty mostly with cat hair. The other reviews are correct in saying it is very difficult to clean.I just received a fountain called The Bubbler which was recommended by another reader at Amazon. Fantastic product and I would highly recommend getting this instead of the Fresh Flow or the Drinkwell.It does NOT have water filtration, which is fine with me. I think the other two fountains have to have filters to help with all the cat hair that gets stuck in it.Instead, The Bubbler has a base, a one-gallon reservoir, an external pump, and a hose. Those are all the parts! The reservoir is cleverly designed so I DIDN'T SPILL A DROP while placing the reservoir on the base. It looks like both main parts are heavy plastic and dishwasher-safe. I'm sure the small hose can be run under hot water with soap and that does it for cleaning. Since the pump is external and doesn't actually come into contact with the water...it doesn't clog and NEVER NEEDS TO BE CLEANED.The pump simply pushes air to two hoses that emerge from the bottom of the base. This creates bubbling action in the bowl. It's very quiet from fifteen feet away while I type this, I can barely hear it. It sounds like a far-off hum from here, and something bubbling up close. The pump doesn't make any noise that I can hear AT ALL!.I needed a fountain because my kitties don't drink enough water. I don't care if it's filtered water or not, I don't mind cleaning the bowl. The Bubbler creates the movement that is already attracting them to drink more. So far I'm very pleased.Unlike the other reader who commented, I was not able to find The Bubbler at the grocery store for $15. I paid about $32 including shipping and I'm very happy with the results.

0 starts would be more appropriate.Finally wanted to update from Quickbooks Pro 5 (Mac), and purchased the download version. After confirmation of purchase the download page resulted in a "File not found" message, no matter how I tried to access it. There was no option to report a problem! The only customer support was via phone for a fee of $39.-. Unwilling to pay this I cancelled my order and requested a refund - That seemed to work, but according to their website you have to do this within 45 min of purchase!!! It was hard to find. By the time I realized the problem, tried to contact customer service and found the hidden refund info, my time for requesting a refund was almost up!I will stick with my reliable workhorse Quickbooks Pro 5 for Mac, and forego the improvements I had hoped for (Mac address book tie in. i.e.) At least this old version works.Don't bother with the download version!

Let me start of by stating that this will be the first time I ever returned an item to Amazon.  Yes, I sometimes get product I am not satisfied with, but I usually give them away.  However, not this time, I will not let some poor soul get fooled by this inaccurate piece of ... plastic!  I would be afraid that someone might take these readings seriously and become anorexic.Two trainers (sports medicine and nutritionist majors) measured me at the same time.  One was at 16.5% and the second at 18%.  I bought the Accu-Measure Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester and it measured 17.5%, heck even the Navy tape measure system measured 20.1%.  The Omron HBF-500 estimates 29%!  I read and reread the instructions and I keep getting 26% - 29%.  Yes I get these results seconds apart.  I do not expect it to be perfect, I am well aware of a 1-3 point variance between measurements but 11 points is ridiculous. Am I to believe that I am an "athlete" because it clearly states it does not work on athletes?  I am in good shape and I do exercise regularly.  However, I do not consider myself to be in the same class a triathlete or any pro athlete.   Does this only work on sedentary people?   By the way it cant even get weight measurements right.  It varies up to 1.8lbs! I swear I try to stand on the exact same position and it still varies, it even varies more if I reposition it on the same surface.  So how do I know which is right.  I would not even mind if it was slightly inaccurate, but I do demand consistency.  How else am I to track progress?  One last rant.  The guy pictured on the box looks as if he is in ok shape.  Why does it work for him?

Well, what more can I say that hasn't been said already?This movie was brilliant! Excellent, even though there's little dialogue (at least for the first 1/2 of the movie)....To be honest, "Less was definitely More" in this movie. As a matter of fact, this movie could have done just fine without any human dialogue, and it still would have been a great film. Very emotional movie....The writers & producers of this movie did an outstanding job.This movie has an incredible storyline, and certainly makes you think about our lives (as humans), and where we're headed, in the future, if we don't get our acts together. Hopefully, if we ever get to that point, we'll have E.V.E. & Wall-E there to help save us.This was one of Pixar's best films.Gonna watch it again right now!.....no, really......I am!

I've been very happy with this product thus far.  It heats up to the level necessary to tame my thick and frizzy hair, and doesn't dry out my hair as it straightens.  My only potential concern is for people who don't need as much heat as I do - there appears to be no way to adjust the temperature.  I really appreciate the smaller size as well, since my last straightener was considerably larger and heavier.  I would recommend this product to my friends!

I've been using the CBEFM for 4 months now and it has been a great tool for predicting ovulation.  I have found it to be a less stressful procedure than taking my BBT everyday, and it is highly accurate.  For those of you with irregular cycles, this is a wonderful tool to help pinpoint those fertile days!  The monitor and sticks can get expensive, but I think they are worth it.

We've been through at least a dozen different varieties of baby gates over the years as we have a 7 yr old and a 1 yr old and many pets.  By far, this is the best we've seen.  Its solidly constructed, easy to install, can be positioned in a number of places that most gates just won't work and is only slightly more expensive than less effective models.  I don't know anyone with tots that doesn't walk around the house carrying something when they need to go into the gated area -- laundry baskets, baby, etc.  With this gate, no need to put anything down to open it.    Just step on the pedal latch and press your knee against gate.  (It'll be obvious when you see it).  The gate swings open without needing your hands.  Also, the pedal requires a significant amount of weight be applied so its safe and the tots can't accidentally open it.  We bought one initially with the extension to fit a very awkwardly positioned high-traffic area where no other gate could be installed.   Now we're buying a second gate for another spot because it solves the baby-containment problem so well.

I cannot begin to say how much I love this show.  This was a collaboration of dream actors, writers and crew, and it shows in every episode.  I miss Alex O'Loughlin's handsome face on television so this is a present to those of us waiting for his return in 2009; with Twilight and True-Blood so prominent, this show was a part of a triad of quality vampire-themed programs that hit a fantasy nerve with viewers. As the main character, Mick St. John, says, it's a thrill ride that never ends...!

This review is from: Iron Man [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      

Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, "Iron Man" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, "The Incredible Hulk" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.But I digress. "Iron Man".Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. & Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.Directed by Jon Favreau ("Elf", "Zathura" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist."Iron Man" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until Tony becomes old enough to take the reins. Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. Naturally, he feels threatened by Tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. So in his mind, lethal is good.Obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.Terrence Howard plays Colonel Jim Rhodes, a longtime associate of Tony, who acts as a liaison between Stark and his government contacts. When Stark is taken hostage, Rhodes leads the rescue mission. When Stark becomes Iron Man, Rhodes helps him out in various ways.As you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real."Iron Man" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. The performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make "Iron Man" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge "Spiderman" in popularity.

Because this product was inexpensive and seemed easy to use, I ignored the bad reviews it got.  Please don't make the same mistake I made.  From the very first time I tried to download my videos, I received error messages.  The coup de grace came less than 1 week after I purchased the recorder,  at my child's birth.  This recorder CRASHED at the EXACT MOMENT when the doctor put our new baby on my wife's chest.  I could not get it to record at all - then or throughout the next few days.  I cannot tell you HOW DISAPPOINTED I am with this product, and words really can't express what a POORLY MADE, PATHETIC EXCUSE for a video camera this is.  DO NOT IGNORE THE BAD REVIEWS.

My wife starting snoring a few years ago.  I'm a pretty light sleeper & it soon got to the point where I was sleeping almost every night in another room.  We decided to try this, but I really had my doubts.  I was really surprised.  The first night's snoring decreased by more than 90%.  The second night I detected no snoring at all.

I would have more but my car broke down. Whether I am watching it or listening to it I get emotional because I feel like I can be a wildcat. This is a way HS should be. I wish it was for when I was in HS. lol. This is the type of film all should see and love it. Wheither it's for a certain Wildcat, The musical numbers, or whatever, it's a must!

I was under the impression I'd be getting a viable means of measuring body fat with this device.  I'll be 50 years old at summer's end and have always worked out.  When I got my first measurements, I was shocked.  The unit indicated I had 25% body fat.  Caliper measurements, as well as those calculators wherein you enter height, weight, and a few tape measurements, always indicated results ranging from 12 - 18% body fat.  Vanity aside, it is obvious I work out as I have discernable muscularity, including 6-pack abs.  Standing 6 feet, weighing 175, and looking like I do, I really wondered if Omron could be accurate.  I contacted their support center and was informed that the unit is accurate for 2 out of 3 people and that it wasn't designed for athletes.  I'm not sure I understand why that would be so, but that is what they told me.  So, if you're already in decent shape, this may not be the product for you.

I purchased this Juicer based on the high rated reviews. Received it the next day and put it to work. I attempted to juice a few carrots, oranges and strawberries. It did ok on the carrots but it was literally throwing orange and strawberry pieces out of the feed chute. The motor is too powerful for it's own good and there's no option to switch to a lower speed. While the juice was pouring down to the plastic container, it splashed a lot, this is a design failure and I shouldnt have to put paper towels underneath. Contrary to all the people raving about easly clean up,  cleaning the parts is not that easly and rinsing under the sink will not get the pulp out from all the corners. The large mesh screen is difficult to clean using various brushes and it's fragile. All this juicer has going for itself is that it's powerful and fast and so what when it takes you forever to clean it's parts. I can juice and clean my old juicer in a much shorter amount of time. I have returned this juicer for a full refund. Extremely overrated product.

I'm disappointed by this product.  I was comparing it to the George Foreman models with removable grill plates, and I went with the Cuisinart model because it seemed like a better made product.Cleaning the grills is a huge PITA.  My old george foreman grill had attached plates, but it wasn't as much of a hassle to clean.  I've tried soaking the plates, leaving wet paper towels on them after cooking, non stick spray...nothing makes the job easier.  Each pretty grill mark on the meat leaves a huge mess on the grill, and each raised metal grill portion has a 90 degree angle for food to get stuck in.  To clean it thoroughly, you need to go over each angle, then clean the tops, then the middle troughs.  It's very time consuming, and it makes me question whether the plates are actually coated with something nonstick.I'm also diappointed by the depth of the grilling plates.  Liquid and fat pours over the edges easily.  It puddles by the griddler's feet, on the back side, and into the grill where the heating elements are.I think this item is best suited for pancakes or grilling sandwiches.  It doesn't handle grilled meat or moist items very well.I don't think I would re-purchase the item, because it takes way too long to clean it.  It makes it more of burden than a useful kitchen tool.

Which it came with a manual though for people that are not too into computers and the "string" that comes with it is useless, i wouldn't put it in my keychain, it looks like it can brake any second. if it would come with something stronger though would be better.

My son is not 41 pounds yet, but he does not fit in size 6 diapers anymore. I guess it's because he is chunkier than he should be for his height. I am so glad that Pampers invented size 7 just as my son started needing them. Now I don't have to buy medical diapers for him. My son is severely disabled, and I need to buy diapers for him until he is 3 years old. Then the insurance will cover them. Thanks, Pampers, for making size 7. I only wish I could get them in any store!I think the Pampers work great. My son hasn't had a leaky Pamper yet, and believe me, my son has a tendency to have leaky diapers from time to time.

Cheaper products don't work as well as this one does. This one involves a simple one use vial that is squeezed on the back of the neck (this way they cannot lick it off)each month.  Buy the larger pack as it has along shelf life and works out cheaper per unit.

H&R Block is guilty of false advertising.  The product box and the ad above says this product will import TurboTax returns.  When I couldn't do that, I went to the H&R web site and found that it can't import TurboTax Business returns (does it import the personal?), and the "resolution" is to enter the data by hand.  Yeah, including all the depreciation information that TurboTax has been calculating for me for the last several years.  I don't think so.  AVOID THIS PRODUCT.

I'm not generally a fan of wireless controller, for one simple reason.  I don't need the wireless feature, and I'd prefer to not think about batteries.  However, I was not about to pass up the $20 after rebates price on this pad.This button arrangement of this pad perfectly fits Madden 2005, enhancing gameplay immensely over other pads that may require you to remember what button correspond to what in the manual. (Madden 2005 allows you to configure your gamepad, but the configuration does not work for all phases of the game, e.g., the snap, and the receivers may be labelled differently than set up in Madden 2005's button configuration utility.)True, the gamepad lacks Force-Feedback in Madden 2005 - so does every other game controller.  MADDEN 2005 PC DOES NOT SUPPORT FORCE-FEEDBACK FOR ANY GAMEPAD, PERIOD.  That's EASport's fault, not Logitech's.For the person with the calibration problems after replacing batteries, try unplugging the receiver unit from the USB port and plugging it back in.If you want to play Madden 2005, and have no intention of playing games with Force-Feedback, but by the non-Forceback version of this gamepad, unless you get a deal.  Similarly, unless you get a deal on this gamepad, or you really want or need wireless, get the wired version of this gamepad.

I ordered the kitchen aid mixer because it is the #1 in stand mixers. It is so easy to use and really looks classy in one's kitchen especially since I wanted the Red Artisan Style I just love it. My Husband makes over 75 batches of Divinity every year at Christmas time and Kitchen Aid is the only mixer with the hyped up motor to have the pull it takes on the motor. There is no other one like Kitchen Aid.

He is also using Inderal-10 to suppress high blood pressure, So it will be of great use for him to track his blood pressure, and even for other family members.

Once Upon a Time,Alright... I'm actually a little lost as to what I should say to be honest.  I really loved Twilight.  I liked New Moon, I fell for Jacob and Edward in Eclipse.  Breaking Dawn was a disappointment.  If you are looking for a fairytale ending here you go.  Have at it.  If you are looking for the real truth of true love, of pain, of sacrifice, of life just don't read this book.I repeat don't read this book.  Create your own ending, create your own pain and fantasy of the epic of Bella and Edward, of the sacrifice of Jacob.  For if you read this book you will be disgusted and creeped out a little on who Jacob imprints on.  The plot was not as good as the first three books.  Bella did not grow up, she did not learn that anything worth having is hard to get and comes with a price.  Instead Meyer threw the pain and epic battles of the first three books out the window and implanted Bella with happiness and sparkles. I believe that every single reader expected differently of Meyer and I am sad to say she threw in the towel for this book.  It was as if she was so worried about pleasing everyone that she ended up pleasing no one.  Bella runs away with the entire cake and eats it too.  For all your fans who believe that this was a great book and ended perfectly I pity your lack of imagination and wish that Meyer treated us with another Twilight or another Host.The End (Is this where I say dreams do come true?)

I purchased this camera as a replacement for my JVC GR-DVM70. I loved the idea of recording to solid state memory, and creating videos in high definition since I have two high definition tv sets.What I have learned is, the video format AVCHD is just not supported yet. I purchased a game console to view the videos and that works well, but since I am the only one who has the game console I am the only person who can view my movies. :(. The software that comes with the camera is bare bones. It will not allow you to convert AVCHD to standard DVD except directly from the camera. The problem is, the video on the camera is not edited hence if you choose to do this, the dvd will have all the junk that you taped that you don't want to see. The software has edit capability, but it is not intuitive. And I edited a 30 minute movie to remove some footage, and it took 3 hours for the software to save the small edited file! Supposedly you can save the file back to the camera and then save the file from the camera to dvd. I tried this, but canceled the operation because of the time constraint. It takes 5 to 6 hours to do this for a 30 minute video.The camera does not have an auto fade, the specs are wrong. It has semi-auto fade. While video taping, you need to press the joy stick to tell the camera to fade out when the pause button is pressed. Pressing the joystick while recording makes the camera shake and ruins the video. Another pet peeve is that the date and time can not be retained on the final video. And the stabilizer isn't very good once you zoom out to about 10X and beyond. And it has no view finder, for those bright sunny days. Also it insists on being plugged into the wall outlet when you hook it up to your PC.The movies that this camera takes which I play on the ps3 in HD look no better than the video that my 8 year old JVC took. Go figure. No motor noise on the movies from the HF100 however.The nice things about the camera are it's size, it is very portable and it records directly to solid state SDHC. It does a decent job of recording in low light. The still images it takes are decent.I will take the gamble and continue to make my AVCHD movies and store them. Hopefully editors and blue ray players will be developed and be affordable so that I can share my movies one day.

The great benefit of this camera is that it's so easy to use and that everything comes in one package. There's no need for extra cables, chips, software - anything really, because it's all inside this cute little box. The image quality is obviously not going to compare to its 3 Chip cousins, but that's not what this is for. Compared to a single chip camera costing 5x as much - the image holds up. I'm even impressed by the quality of the onboard mic, and I'm an audio professional. Bottom line - this is one great product that you'll be happy to play with long after the box is thrown away. This will be one of the hot products of the holiday season and a sure fire hit for all the YouTube wannabe stars. Pure Digital got it right this time. Can't wait to see what they come up with next.

This review is from: Watchmen (Hardcover)
      

Watchmen will probably take a couple reads for you to be able to grasp the entire essence of what it is.  It is a political work of art riddled with original stories and characters.  The thing that works for Watchmen, is that even though there is so much information passing through the pages, all of it is very valuable as it combines into a piece as a whole.  The story reads like an actual screenplay and it definitely feels like it comes off the pages.Our characters instantly make themselves favorites in the comic book world.  Alan Moore couldn't have imagined better ideas.  He kind of makes fun of the superhero idea and slams our brains with the reality of it.  This realistic approach to superheroes totally gives comic readers a new perspective and that makes this novel extremely valuable.I won't get too much into the politics because I wasn't alive at the time.  I believe, however, that it gives the book a much bigger importance by tangling itself into the real world.  This stuff is very interesting for most readers.To conclude, I would say that this novel is a benchmark in graphic novels.  It is a cornerstone to the comic world.  I am very scared about the attempt to adapt this to film.  Zack Snyder is an excellent director, but as he stated "The movie is unfilmable." I have high hopes, but with such an original novel I don't know if they will be able to hollywoodize it.  Alan Moore is one of the greatest writers of his time.  And this novel is his masterpiece.

If you listen to podcasts the 4th generation IPod will not progress to the next file in the list. You have to manually select the next file- not a good idea if you are driving at the time! I have yet to find a workable solution to this problem. Also, if you have any IPod adapters like a Sound Dock or a car radio the 4th generation will not charge unless you purchase an additional adapter from Griffin (about $30). If you really want an IPod, buy a 3rd generation or wait until the 5th generation comes out and hope they fixed some of these major problems.

I have had (and still have) several wireless routers from different companies.  This seemed to work OK until it stopped connecting to the internet (after maybe 6 months).  I tried an SMC which worked fine so I knew the problem was in this router.  I spent an hour on the phone with 2 &quot;customer service&quot; reps who just wanted to verify what the problem was over and over.  I was disconnected from the first (by accident or on purpose) after 25 minutes.  I called right back.  The second one diudn't even get their procedures right (I had just been through them 3 times) as he skipped necessary steps (Like telling me to open properties of the network connections icon in control panel rather thn opening it and going to the connection at issue.)  After 20 more minutes of this, I asked to speak to a supervisor.  He put me on hold for 7 minutes then came on and told me I would be transferred.  I got 3 rings -- then a dial tone.  Linksys seems to have farmed out customer support to a call center where the people are very hard to understand, where they seem to know nothing, and where they seem so inattentive that they lose track of where they are in their checklists.  I will never buy linksys again.  That's the only way to not have to deal with these folks since problems with the equipment arise with some frequency.

I bought an ipod touch 2nd generation with 32GB about 6 months ago.My Ipod was working fine for 4 months and it was great while it did. Then it crashed and the sleep button and the volume up and down buttons malfunctioned. I sent the unit back and was told that they could find nothing wrong with it and shipped it back. It continued to have the same problem and than about a week later somehow started working correctly again. Now two months later the unit literally died right in front of my eyes while I was holding it at work. Only six months old! I sent the unit back and this time it was returned with a note saying "we regret we were unable to complete the service you requested due to one of the following conditions - a diagnostic evaluation has determined the ipod has internal damage related to a liquid spill or contamination". The unit was never exposed to any water or other fluid as I treated it with TLC complete with a skin and screen cover. The only way it could have had water damage was if there was condensation. However, this seems unlikely since I live in the desert southwest. Anyway, i called apple after receiving the letter and they could offer no help at all.I have always been an early adopter of new technologies and guess I have just been lucky not have any issues with any of my electronic equipment. However, this series of events has frankly left me feeling very cheated. I had already bought an additional Iphone for my wife and another Ipod touch for an another family member. So far without issue. However, I wish I knew how apple treated its customer before hand! Never would have bought them.As it stands, I had four people at work convinced that they needed to have an ipod touch prior to my experience. All of them have since reconsidered. Economic times are tough, to tough to throw $400.00 in the trash!

Product worked great at the beginning but after a very few times of poaching, the egg gets more and more runny until now it is almost like a raw egg even after putting more water than it calls for when poaching.  The next time I poach I will try putting the water up to the boiled eggs line and see if that will work.  It continues to steam some but it must not be hot enough.  I like the concept and I must have a defective egg poacher because the other reviews have not mentioned this problem.

There are a few things you should know. I have been using a pedometer for about 6 months now and recently "upgraded" to the slick 720 due to a great price discount. I love the features of past day's memory, ability to download to PC, aerobic counts, etc. However, it has some major problems. Here are my complaints:* The size. This thing is pretty huge to wear around all day and is hardly inconspicuous.* The stupid clip is just amazing it passed through initial product development. The clip falls off VERY easily and even more often the unit falls out of the clip. It happens just about every time I squat of bend over -- which is often if you walk with the dog and you have to toss a ball or pick up after them (which is extra unpleasant to suddenly have a piece of electronics attempting to dive into the pile of poo).* The accuracy. This is the biggest problem of all as it's the main reason I have the thing! I have a digiwalker that counts very accurately without any of the features that I have used to compare with this one. The Omron is very accurate when you are on a walk, but it has a delay before it starts counting. If you continue walking it counts all the steps during that delay, but if you stop it ignores them all. Presumably this is to avoid counting accidental bumps in someone's bag or something, but when it's on your waist and you are just milling around the house, office, running errands, or what-have-you it will undercount by 50% or more. It's very, very frustrating. If you want to keep track of the steps only when you are going for a walk, then this unit is probably hard to beat. If you want to track your steps over a day and more or less constantly use the unit, there are more accurate, smaller units that you will be happier with (though you'll have to track, record, and reset the counter yourself).

This was my first convection toaster oven, and I must say that I was very impressed when I baked my first frozen pizza in it. It was the first time that any pizza came out with the crust crispy from a toaster oven that I had used!CONS : Just note that it is sloped at the back so when you bake something, the back half will cook faster than what is at the front. So, you'll have to remember to turn the tray halfway through cooking. I've had pizzas and toast burnt on one side and be perfect on the other, so you'll definitely have to keep an eye on the stuff while it cooks.It does get hot, but not more than most toaster ovens. I keep mine on a countertop with plenty of space around it.When I got mine, it came new... but the door had trouble closing after I slid in the little bottom rack. Not a big deal, since I just bent the jams in the door a little and all is well.Price. If I had to buy this at the price listed, I would not. Fortunately, I had two amazon vouchers, so I was able to take off $50 off the retail price and got it for about $20 with free shipping when it was all said and done.I'm looking for another toaster oven now... will definitely get one that isn't sloped in the back where the heating elements will toast food up unevenly. That can be quite annoying!

Although most of the review here are of HJ-112 which does not connect to the PC, HJ-720ITC can connect to PC.  I needed to install software first, but it was easy.  The data transfer from the unit to the PC is also just pushing a button.  The software is solid enough and do not cause stability issue so far.  The good point of the software is that it shows hourly, dayly, weekly and monthly steps I made.  Especially, hourly step count is interesting because it reminds me of what I was doing at that time; one day I worked until 2AM midnight and went home, restarted working 6AM after some sleep.(what a hard worker I am!).  It is shown as step bar chart.It is also motivating to see such graph for work out.  Highly recommended.

I have used Turbotax for about 10 years and while there have been a few bugs, I have generally been satisfied.  No more.  This is the WORST EDITION OF TURBOTAX EVER.There are problems with incomplete form input information,  printing problems (one inch of form missing from right side), problems with the program crashing (numerous times - and loosing ALL information).  Their website is of no help, and questions go unanswered.I am concerned that there may be errors in the computation of the taxes - resulting in too much (or too little) tax owed.  These are the things that trigger audits and penalties. The programmers on this version were either asleep at the job or they all quit.  Either way, this program is a dog.Skip this one and hire somebody to do your taxes, or get a different program.  This is a waste of money and time.

I was able to get this cat toy for $4.69 on Amazon and just noticed that they bumped up the price.  My cats love this thing!  I took it out of the box and they immediately took a liking to it.  The kitten goes on top of the cardboard thing and uses it for scratching.  My other cat, I can tell she wants to play with it too, but let's the kitten go on it first.  She'll play with it once a while when the kitten is done.The cats also went crazy over the catnip that it came with.. they really love this toy.

Problem with LaCie 1TB Neil Poulton hard disk (model 301315U with FW 400 & eSATA connectors): I wrote to the Mikey Mouse LaCie Support & asked twice about how to control the fan and twice they replied there was NO FAN in this model!The casing is made of plastic so not good for heat dissipation and in a cool 20c (68F) room it overheats at 46c (115F) in it's normal horizontal position. Overheating shortens the hard disk life.The internal fan never ran on USB or Firewire connections. Putting it in vertical position for better airflow dropped the temperature 9c (16F). The problem is that now I have ugly cables sticking in the air.I then connected the drive using eSata & curiously it unlocked the noisy fan somehow, now it's on ALL THE TIME even on Firewire & modulates fan speed even if the drive runs only at 29c (84F) and never turns off.I strongly suggest you download a utility to monitor your external hard disk temperature if you do not want to lose all your data from an overheating drive, the #1 cause of failing drives.Do yourself a favor & get the newer model made of aluminium & standing vertical for much better self cooling properties: LaCie 301442U d2 Quadra Hard Disk 1TB eSATA/FireWire800/FireWire400/USB 2.0 External Hard Drive (Aluminum)

I've not used the video record feature but expect to soon. 1-User interface is at a 'beta' stage and is not friendly or well thought out.2-When playing audio it is not possible to leave the track selection menu and dig around looking for other tracks without stopping the music3-You cannot connect the unit to a PC and the TV at the same time (you can physically but only 1 will work).4-Others have reported that 2 PC's cannot connect via the network simultaneously... I've not tried this but it would not surprise me.5-Comments about the remote being poor in terms of angle are correct - it's poor6-There is no online administration (HTML/web interface). It must be administered via the TV.7-The play list s/w that comes with the unit is lame at best ... VERY minimal functionality.8-The poor documentation indicates that winamp can be used to create play lists but gives no clues as to how.9-File xfr is limited to cifs and FTP ... (nfs or rsynch would be nice!)10-no issues moving files although the largest I've moved is about 1.7GB11-functions well as a secondary backup (NAS) as long as your happy with CIFS or FTP.12-Iomega website is awkard to navigate13-Support forums for this device are almost non-existent14-Video playback formats are limitedFor $250 it's not a bad little (limited) NAS but the promise on the box is unfulfilled!!

The HD video quality is top notch.....but its a little on the boring side watching animals do boring animal things.  My advice is for you to rent this or just skip it all together because its very boring unless you are really into animals.  Personally I would rather watch an action movie in HD than disgusting animals slober all over themselves in 1080p.

Although I have recommended the WRT54G to many people over the last couple of years (which ended up being V1-4), I have had a version 5 and version 6 of this router now and neither lasts more than 5-10 minutes when there is VoIP traffic from my Linksys PAP2 going through it.  The power light starts blinking and it resets itself.  I've current got the WRT54GL on order so I can get back to life without dropped calls (got an old Microsoft MN-500 in place of it now and it also has no issues with same environment/settings).

When I first saw this thing I ridiculed it, I was not to keen in accepting the specs and the reliability but the more I read up on it and viewed more videos and specs on it, the more I wanted it. I now ave it, added two gigs of ram and even added a portable hard drive for extra storage. I have not been disappointed with this purchase, matter of fact I even get the occasional jealous eye from other laptop owners always asking the same thing: how much, where i can get one and can I try it out? The speed on this EEE PC is pretty good considering I have thrown a few heavy apps, mainly Photoshop and Mixmeister and I have even downloaded some heavy files. I have put this threw the ringer and still it keeps up. If setup right, you can in theory get the 7 hours of promised battery life although I have only been able to squeeze about 5 but that is plenty for me. I very happy with this purchase, might even consider a later model sometime in the future

Howard the Duck back in the day was an all time favorite, but because this day and age I would really like to have a DVD for my children to enjoy the movies I watched when I was their age, with sense of humor and just sort of an all time classic movie. The kid in me will still enjoy this movie

I'm old enough to have watched the original series and I enjoyed the campy "let' s not take ourselves to seriously" feel. The original had great actors Lorne Greene, Jane Seymour, Ray Milland (Pilot) to name a few. John Colicos was the ultimate villain, no angst with this guy. Not only was there an ensemble cast but each week cameo appearances by Fred Astaire, Lloyd Bridges and many others. One of my favorite characters was Colonel Tigh played by Terry Carter. So with excitement I watched this remake of a classic 70's show.Imagine my horror when I saw this rubbish that seems to bear little resemblance to the original. I think the people behind this show had the original described to them without ever watching one episode. Each and every character has been changed for the sake of change. Adama was regal now militaristic. Can someone tell me why the blacks are gone? (I guess because blacks can't afford cable so who cares.) Starbuck was a bad boy womanizer but now is a female. So Apollo's wing man is female. The Starbuck character is the typical male warrior who is dysfunctional except in combat. A female in this role is hard to buy, since most dysfunctionals are male(see "The War Lover"). A could only stomach part of the pilot. I thought I was watching Melrose Place in space instead of a first rate Scifi. The characters seem flat and one dimensional. The worst part is how seriously this show takes itself. I don't really understand the popularity of this show. It is on the Scifi channel and can't have the audience (or Budget) of a CSI. Try to watch a couple episodes for free. Firefly is a decent show with an original concept(and at least it was on network TV). I would say don't waste your time or money unless you really like this kind of tripe.

I'm no computer expert so take that into account.  But I love this little netbook.  I wanted something easily transportable, inexpensive, but with a keyboard that wouldn't drive me crazy.  My husband and I checked out the 8 & 9" netbooks in a couple of stores & I knew those wouldn't work for me because of the small keyboards.  But when I saw that the Asus keyboard is 95% of a normal laptop keyboard that made the decision for me.  My only issue with it is the location of the right shift key.  I'm learning, but now that I know I can remap it I'm going to try to do that instead.  The HE fixes that keyboard issue but for the same $ we added the OCZ 2 GB PC2-5400 667 MHz DDR2 Value SODIMM Laptop Memory (OCZ2MV6672G) to double the memory instead.  Bluetooth wasn't important to me, and I wanted white. So the HA was the right choice for me. People who complain about the track pad apparently aren't using it properly, mine works just fine when you press on the angled edge, not straight down.  I do use a mouse most of the time but the track pad works just fine when I need it.Overall I'm very, very happy with it.

I bought this based on Amazon Reviews and am delighted with it.  It does everything I need, is sturdy  and easy to set up. the designers thought of everything.  Caution, if you wear it while dancing, it shows a lot more  mileage than you actually cover.  Not a problem because you usually don't wear it then.

I'm really looking forward to this DVD release. A lot of "Battlestar Galactica" fans have had negative things to say about Season 2.0, Volume 2. I agree with some of the criticism, but not all of it. The one real problem I have with this show is that most episodes are very predictable and many of the storylines just keep recycling themselves. Almost every episode in this season seems to revolve around Adama, Starbuck, or Apollo being in mortal peril...that gets kind of old after a while. However, in spite of that, this is still a great show. It's so FRACKIN' INTENSE! A lot of important things happened during this season involving Adama's clash with the commander of the Pegasus ship, President Roslin's terminal cancer diagnosis, Starbuck and Apollo's personal relationships and professional development, Gaius Baltar's rise to power, and the cylon's infiltration into what is left of the human race. I don't want to spoil the season for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but there are plenty of "shock and awe" moments to look forward to. Beloved characters will die, surprise relationships will form, and the season finale cliffhanger is unlike anything you've ever seen in the series before! NOTHING will prepare you for what happens during the last 15 minutes of the final episode!I can't wait until the new season debuts this fall, but until then, I'm looking forward to catching last season's episodes for the second time with this DVD set.

Not one to usually jump on any bandwagons, I felt it would be an injustice not to come and add my own glowing review of the Breville wok. Since opening the box, we've not gone one single night without cooking in it. It heats (and I do mean HEATS!!!!) instantly and the non-stick surface makes cooking a quick and easy breeze. It keeps meat melt-in-your-mouth tender and the veggies retain their color, taste and texture thanks to the uber-high temps and quick cooking. Clean up is a cinch thanks to the removable base. AND YOU CAN PUT IT IN THE DISHWASHER! Unbelievable. Usually you'd pay 3 times what this wok sells for on Amazon for a piece of cooking equipment of this caliber. I'm telling all my friends to buy one, and if you're into healthy, quick, easy cooking, then this wok is a must-have for your kitchen.

I own a KA Artisan Series 5-Qt. Stand Mixer in "Blue Willow."  I am a casual baker and am relatively new in the kitchen and prior to making this purchase, I did quite a bit of research on stand mixers.  I found that the questions you have to ask yourself prior to making this purchase are:(1)  Do you really need one, and, if the answer is yes, then;(2)  Is this a one-time purchase, and;(3)  Which stand mixer actually *fits* your needs?Though I was tempted to get a big 6-Qt professional, bowl-lifting, super cool mixer, I realized that I generally cook for two people and that I would not need to ever really mix 14-cups of flour or 8 pounds of potatoes.  Even if I did, I'd be doing it in smaller batches anyway. So that brought me back to my senses and I considered the KA Artisan.Comparatively:  Oddly, it only has 325 watts of power.  Other stand mixers of this size offer up to 500 watts; the KA 6 Qt. Pro offers 525 watts and a bowl "lift" function.  I don't know if this makes a huge difference, but my KA stands up to whatever I put in it.  I use it to make mostly cookie and bread doughs.  It comes with three accessories: flat beater, dough hook, and wire whip.  The flat beater is very versatile and I have really appreciated not having to wrestle with my crappy hand-mixer when mixing things like softened cream cheese.  I can throw it all into the bowl at once and walk away to start something else.Cleanup:It's a snap.  While I tend to still get flour all over "The Fuselage," as I call my mixer, it wipes off in a jiffy because of the sleek exterior.  I don't find the "chute" of the pouring shield especially "easy" to add ingredients, especially when it's flour from a big mixing bowl.  The chute is not quite wide enough and flour tends to spill, so sometimes I don't use it, but this creates "splash-up" instead, so it's kind of a no-win situation.  The steel bowl is absolutely smooth and so there are no real ridges inside the bowl for anything to stick to.  The accessories twist off in a one-handed motion, are very secure and heavy, and are coated with a slick, non-stick, white finish - washing up is absolutely easy.Counter Space: You cannot put this away, or you will never get it out again.  So for small apartment dwellers, you must think about your counterspace.  I am a pretty small female, and to me, is HEAVY, HEAVY, HEAVY.  While this is good because it doesn't wobble or "walk" across the countertop when it's mixing, this also makes it a gigantic pain to drag it out.  So anticipate that it will take up about 1 cubic foot of your countertop forever and that you should have it somewhere where you don't have to move it.Mixing:It is very, very thorough.  It has some weird "planetary mixing action," but whatever that means, it mixes mostly everything evenly.  Turn it off before you stick your spatula in.  It handles the stickiest focaccia dough to meringue perfectly, and the bowl "locks in" to the base, so you don't have to worry about it flying off.Attachments:These are super pricey in most cases, but the one that seems to draw the most raves is the pasta cutter (apprx. $100).  KA constantly has deals and sometimes has nice packaged deals on their website, so check there as well.  I have seen KA offer different accessories (including this one) for free on rebate, so watch for those.  KA also is constantly flogging "The Mixer Bible" by Meredith Deeds and on their website, they sometimes have an ask-and-answer with the author.  I do recommend getting a stand-mixer cover, or if you want to make one, there are several patterns available on the internet.  I'm lazy and cheap, so I use a big dishrag and that has worked so far.Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase.  When I do use "the Fuselage" for baking jobs, it performs flawlessly and makes the baking much, much easier - you can get a good look at your dough consistency, etc. instead of worrying about if your frosting has unmixed chunks in it, or if your hand mixer is going to tip your entire bowl of pudding over while you run to get some missed ingredient.  By proxy, its ease of use turns you into a better cook in the end.  More relaxed, anyway, and if that's worth a couple hundred dollars to you, then by all means, buy it.

This review is from: New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) (Hardcover)
      

After Twilight, I had hoped for a better sequel.   I compared the first book to Buffy and Angel, but the second is a much better comparison to the Olivia Hussey version of Romeo and Juliet.  (good job here Ms Meyer with recognizing that fact)   Funny, now in my mid forties, I struggle with watching those old films and how weak and dependant the women are portrayed.  (I'll take Clair Danes' Juliet anytime)"New Moon" certainly satisfied my need to get through the series and figure out the ultimate answer-does Bella get turned.   I myself however, am much more partial to Joss Whedon's  "will Buffy and Angel ever do it again."  Joss was extremely careful to ensure Buffy remained strong and in control and a model of the women we all want to be.   Ms Meyer, instead chose to portray Bella like the sappy weepy side that we all have inside of us.  Like all women, I can certainly relate to that hopeless and helpless feeling that follows a break up.  But four months of near catatonia, be real.   Was Ms Meyer just appealing to that "Jerry Springer" mentality where masses of Americans have to watch those worse off than ourselves? I would be tempted to give this book 3 stars just because I did enjoy reading it and who wouldn't feel for the loyal Jacob.  (canine is certainly an apt symbol).   But my undeniable feminist side cannot believe that this is the type of literature our girls should be gaga over.   I really can't find any redeeming qualities with this book, other than the fact that I found it addictive.  Ms Meyers quick simple writing style makes it easy to stay engaged and complete the book on one cup of coffee.

This product Omron HEM-790IT only gives you occasionally correct pulse rates, but the blood pressure readings are just unreliable and often inaccurate.I bought this product because this was the top of their line stuff, and now I wonder what the other models would be like.I cross checked the readings of this product several times with my Physician on his manual BP device and found the accuracy of this product to be as low as 43%.This simply means that it just didn't work properly half the time.This product simply doesn't live upto all the tall claims made by the manufacturer and the customer reviews [possibly fudged or doctored] are grossly misleading.Think twice before you buy !!!!

This collar was made by satan. It retrained my dog to bark at a high screech because it only goes off on the low tone barks. It also goes off for no reason making him think peeing outside is bad, playing, eating... the things dogs need to do are bad. I think it made him neurotic. I'm burning it.  I picked up a collar the sends off beeps, which works a lot better and has stopped his high pitched barking and doesn't go off without warning. It costed a little bit more but it's better then having a crazy dog.

Kingston, in all their majesty, has decided to no longer support W98 for this or any of their products; what is worse is that the lame driver they provide doesn't work properly in W98, I seem to remember that it didn't even unzip properly.  I found a driver on an Italian site that allows the unit to work, but every new unit has to go through the new device found/driver search routine.  Installs ok in Suse Linux, but you have to be logged in as root.  Unit itself works ok.

I purchased this drive from Amazon recently and tested it under both Mac OS X Tiger and Windows ME. In both cases, I saw excellent read speed but slow, slow write speed (1 MB/s to 1.4 MB/s, an order of magnitude lower than advertized). I was very disappointed at the poor performance to say the least.Before returning the drive, I decided to test it under Windows XP. Wow, what a difference. The same drive, under Windows XP, is a speed demon. I am now satisfied that the drive behaves much more closely to it's advertized specs. For read speed, I am seeing something in the area of 30 MB/s, which is excellent. For write speed I am seeing roughly 7 MB/s. This is a little slower than advertized, but nonetheless, an excellent speed.So, this is a great memory stick as long as you are using it under Windows XP (don't have Vista so can't comment, but I expect that performance under Vista would be similar). For earlier versions of Windows (9x and ME) though, be forewarned. Write performance is not good. Similarly, for Mac OS X Tiger be forewarned. BTW, for Mac OS X, I did try formatting the stick for HFS+ (the native Mac OS X format), but it made only a marginal difference.

This netbook is powerful enough for most functions. It works well running a virtual citrix server, so I can access my electronic medical records  and scans from my work.  It chokes when I access a multi-image CT scan on our imaging server, but can pull up a single x-ray without difficulty(pretty impressive for a netbook with only 1 gig of ram).  I have it connected (tethered) through bluetooth to my Samsung Blackjack II cell phone internet connection, so I can access internet anywhere I get an Edge or 3G signal. It works great--total mobility.  The keyboard is A+++. I am a right-shifter and the placement and size of the shift key is much better than my laptop. Did research and believe this is best netbook out there. The battery life is great. It can stream video through wi-fi(high power consumption) for around 6 hours. With average use, it is lasting me all day. No need to carry a battery pack.

My one year old boxer is a big goofy, playful dog.  He adores chewing on water bottles, stuffed toys, milk bones, you name it.  I really thought this toy would be a terrific idea for him but he is absolutely terrified of it.  He growls and barks at it, won't even smell it.  Sounds terrific to me but I guess if you're considering this toy you should probably bring your pup to a pet store to introduce him to it first.

It's a great rice maker - makes good rice without effort. My only cause not to give it 5 stars is that it takes a long time to make the rice - approximately 2-3 times longer than my old cheapo rice cooker. BUT the rice it does make is way better. I especially enjoy the timer function so I can wake up to freshly made rice or oatmeal in the morning. I would say that it is definately worth the money so far.

I have been snoring badly for years. My wife would kick me out of bed or she would go downstairs to sleep on the couch. I hated that. Neither of us got a good nights sleep. I was always tired. I have tried many devices and products that just don't work. The sloped pillow, the nose straps, sprays, ect. The next step was going to be more drastic. Then I saw an article in our local newspaper about devices you could get from your dentist. I researched these and thru that research found Anti-Snore. The name turned me off, but the price was right and the money-back guarantee was good so I ordered one. The fitting procedure was easy. My teeth were sore the first morning and for a few days, but that went away. I don't see the extra slavating that some say they get. It is weird to put something in my mouth each nite, but I got used to it. The BIG thing is that it actually works! It has been around 3 weeks now and my wife says my snorning is gone, except slightly when I'm on my back. We both get a good nights sleep and we sleep together. Thank you Anti-Snore! A product that works and for a good price.

THERE ARE SPOILERS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.To be honest, I haven't even been able to bring myself to finish reading the book, though I do know what happens due to reading spoilers online. I'm just so horrified by what I've read so far that I need to take a break from it. It's corny and overly-contrived and has many "WTF" elements that make the novel seem like an elaborate fanfiction.If you are young and idealistic, by all means, read this novel. It's clear that, generally speaking, only readers aged 12-14 could even hope to enjoy this novel - I should hope older readers would be mature enough to realize that the book is not good, and anyone younger shouldn't be reading it. I say "idealistic" because the novel very much goes in the "happy endings for all!" direction, which, based on the previous novels of the series, should have been impossible, thus making this novel the most extreme deux ex machina I've ever encountered.I must warn away anyone that is even the least bit feminist. Throughout the series, Bella has always been a bit of a letdown for a lead female character: She allows Edward to control almost every aspect of her life, and is so dependent on him that it makes me ill. In this novel, the anti-feminism vibe is pushed even further, with Meyer not-so-subtly hinting that all a woman needs to be happy is a husband and babies. Meyer also conveys an anti-human vibe - by the end of the novel, pretty much all the central characters are some sort of supernatural species, and they all seem thrilled about the fact. It's disturbing, to say the least.The entire novel was just such a huge disappointment. It completely negated one of the major themes of the series: choice. In Eclipse, Bella faces the choice between Edward and Jacob and, knowing what she will give up (Charlie and Renee, Jacob, the possibility of children, college, etc.), she chooses Edward. That extreme sacrifice was, I felt, the most defining characteristic of Edward and Bella's relationship. Breaking Dawn completely negates that sacrifice with the many deux ex machina plotlines Meyer introduces, which cheapens Edward and Bella's relationship, which, as we all know, was always the central aspect of the series.I won't go into any more specifics, but I will say that there were just so many things in this novel that were completely outrageous. When I first read the spoilers, I didn't even believe them. Then when I started reading the novel, I was angry and upset. Now, I've joined the masses that are simply laughing at the novel - we laugh so we don't cry ;)In conclusion: Read the book for laughs. Don't go in with any high expectations of any sort, because you will be severely disappointed.

I loved this coffee maker when I got it for Christmas 2007. I joined a coffee club and my k-cups were soon filling up my pantry closet. I loved it so much that I bought one for my daughter and her husband. Theirs stopped working altogether 8 months after they got it. Mine started acting up after 9 months, taking 10 minutes between brews for the water to heat up for the next cup. (Certainly not ideal when you have company.) I de-scaled, as instructed, and took very good care of the machine. But this morning, after it was done brewing a cup of coffee, I heard a loud "pop" and turned around to see flames shooting up behind it. The fire was out quickly, and no real damage was done, aside from a blown circuit breaker and outlet. The machine, however, is toast - after less than one year of use.  Whie the machine was working, I thought the coffee was above average. But the reliabilty of this model is poor, and the workmanship VERY questionable. I doubt I'll be replacing this with another Keurig.

I received my airport express about 30 days ago.  It was an almost automatic set up and worked for the first 3 weeks.  The communication with the printer was always extremely slow from the get-go.  Recently, the device just quit communicating with the internet.  In order to re-establish internet contact, I had to unplug the device and then run the diagnostic process.  It always recovered (for a while) then lost internet after some period of time.  I contacted Apple support who was unaware (claimed) of the problem.  After 30+ minutes on hold, my connection was terminated.  I'm back to my Linksys and, (if afforded the opportunity), will get my money back from Apple and stay with Linksys.The best I can say about this product is that it is "compact" and Apple tech support folks do speak english.

Make her coffee, send her flowers. ring her for no reason, make her feel 'special', have some chocolates delivered with a Hall Mark card, in fact pander and pander to the flesh rather than preach the Word that commands, (not recommends if everybody has had a good day and the sun is shinning just so, as everybody is eating an ice-cream), that a woman, if she loves the Lord Jesus Christ, submits to her husband as her husband submits to the Lord Jesus Christ to love his wife as he loves his own life. The woman should not be having her 'self esteem' raised by the husband pandering to her fleshly wants and the wife should not be putting up with being patronised by her husband trying to act as if he has just been catching up with all of Ophrah's 'self adoration' philosophies on the tube. Christians need to be taught to go to the Word of God, to get before the LORD in humble prayer, to seek His will on a marriage partner, and on how to maintain a Godly marriage, to turn to the LORD in all matters. But what are we being taught to do? Follow the world! It works for Hollywood so it must work in 'Christendom'. It works for Dr. Phil, so obviously it will work for Fireman Kurt. Yet God tells us again and again to separate from the ways of the world, not seek out the Christian equivalent and peddle that to the worldly church-going masses. (Do you know that this program also promotes remarriage whilst the previous partners are still living? It wasn't in their book, but it's here now! What next? How to Fire Proof you Sodomite marriage?) Christians do not do these imitation HollyWoodStock things well. It always ends up coming across as 'amateurish' making both unbelievers and believers alike cringe deep inside. From all appearances, Kurt is my brother in Christ, and i am thankful to the Lord for that, but Kurt is not a good actor, (praise the Lord), and he's the best thing in the movie, (what does that tell you about the movie?) What can i tell you? America has suddenly become Obama-nation, the Sodomites are storming the gates, the Moslems are preparing for the ultimate check-mate, Israel is being turned on by the nations of the world, including her so-called 'friends' the great apostasy, headed by the Papacy, Rick Warren, Rob Bell, Benny Hinn, Kenneth Hagin and Copeland, Joyce Myers, Jessie Duplantis and Joel Osteen et al'  is gathering momentum and the ecumenical movement is well and truly into the Interfaith movement which, through all of the New Age Bible Per-Versions floating around out there, is preparing the world for the take over of The Antichrist and we are all putting our hopes on the latest 'Christian' movie, (what you mean 'The Shack' didn't save us???) It is time we all grew up in the Lord Jesus Christ and turned to the only solution He ordained: The Holy Bible, (KJV). It is time to redeem the time and repent of all this sinful foolishness, time to stop being ashamed of the power of God unto salvation: the Gospel of Christ, time to stop following the world and start following Christ Jesus. This movie, like all imitations of worldly expression, will do no good at all, it will only appeal to the flesh because it is of the flesh. If you went up to John the Baptist on a Tuesday and asked him to proclaim the will of the Lord, he would have answered you: "REPENT!" If you went up to him the following Saturday and asked him for any news from the LORD, he would have said: "What? I already told you on Tuesday. REPENT!" This proclamation is still the same today because the state of Man is still the same and more importantly, the LORD Himself is the same yesterday, today and forever. It doesn't matter what the problem is, the answer has always been and always shall be the same: The Lord Jesus Christ. Give this turkey a miss and get on your knees and ask for help from the only one who can help. Written with love in Christ Jesus. Anthony Donaghey.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I read several of the reviews prior to purchasing and had some concerns  that the video may not be of very good quality and the drawbacks with the software that comes with it.  I used it for the first time out of the box.  I filmed in my office and then later that day at home.  It was just fine.  The picture quality and sound were as good as the tape models with the added bonus of no tape.  I have Windows Vista on my home computer and had no problem with the software provided (I am not very computer literate).  I also used Windows Movie Maker that was on my home computer.  Quick and easy.  This camera is perfect for home videos and a good value.  Did I mention NO MORE TAPES!!!!!

I suppose there isn't much I can say about this switch that hasn't already been said, but I'm trying to improve my Amazon recommendations by reviewing items, so...This little switch is a beauty.  It just works.  This is one of those items that's invisible when it's working properly, and you really don't even notice it.  It's compact size ( despite the listed dimensions on Amazon ) makes it very portable for those impromptu LANs, and it just looks good.  You'd do well getting one.  There are frequently offers for this item, so try not to pay full price.  Also, the pictured item doesn't seem to match with the actual switch, so be certain which you're getting, I suppose.

This is a simple, compact toaster that has every single feature you'd want to make plain old perfect toast. The design is a throwback to solid engineering. As another reviewer mentioned, it's sturdy yet lightweight. It has a mechanism to hold any dimension of toast, bagel or waffle in place so both sides are evenly toasted. No overly complicated settings, just plain old perfect toast and bagels every time. So much happier with it than my old toaster oven! It also takes up limited counter space. If you're in the market for a new toaster, you'd be hard pressed to do better unless you need a 4 slot model. In that case, I'd probably go with the Haier model as well.

I have two cats - one who likes to be brushed and one who doesn't. The furminator worked well for the one who likes to brushed. The one who doesn't like to be brushed wouldn't sit still for the furminator, even though the advertising suggested that some cats who don't like to be brushed enjoy brushing with the furminator. But even for the one who likes to be brushed, the furminator did a comparable job to what a simple flea comb can do. Try using a flea comb before spending $23 on the furminator.

Stephenie one-upped her fandom by the way she answered her questions - now they're pouting.  Bella grew up and became an adult/wife/mother/vampire in this book.  She's NOT the same as in the first three books - get over it.  This book is a compilation of love stories.  Husband, wife, father, mother, friend, lover, etc...any way you can address it, really.  If you've never experience the all-out power that TRUE love has (that it can make you do stupid, thoughless, OOC things) then you probably won't 'get' this book at all.  I loved it.

This adapter works perfectly for Apple IIe to Mac transfers and vice-versa using the A2V2 and ADT software included in the Virtual II Apple II emulator.  I was able to connect my old Apple IIe to my G4 PPC running OSX 10.4.11 using a Super Serial Card in the Apple IIe, a DB25 to DE9/R232 straight through cable from RetroFloppy.com, and this Keyspan DE9 to USB adapter.  The A2V2 and ADT apps included with the Virtual II emulator I'm using worked on the very first try after following the instructions in the A2V2 help file.  Don't go cheap on the DE9/R232 to USB adapter, this is the one that works.  The drivers are excellent and make this the no problem solution if you are in the small community I'm in.  (Also, DE9 = DB9 in case you were wondering about connector terminology). - I highly recommend this adapter.

This review is from: Gone with the Wind (DVD)
      

If you look beyond the great acting, the magnificent sets, the sweeping landscapes and breathtaking cinematography, "Gone With the Wind" is little more than a high budget soap opera. Much of the movie is taken up by the very silly and unmoving romance between Scarlett and Rhett, two shallow characters who obviously do not belong together, and the various tragedies which befall them after they enter into a sham of a marriage (although it is often difficult to feel much sympathy for a couple living in lavish mansions). The only thing which sets the film apart from the usual daily soap operas about self-desctructive rich people (besides its budget) is its backdrop of the Civil War. However, if you want to see a historical film which at least partially resembles reality, then do not watch "Gone With the Wind".The picture the movie draws of the pre-Civil War south is an overly romantic one of beauty and wealth and civility. Sure, a very small elite of rich landowners did live a lovely and leisurely life in the old south, much like the one portrayed in the opening of the movie, but this was done on the backs of slaves. However, this film makes the old south look like an unspoiled paradise in which nobody had to work. The only thing spoiling this film's picture of a perfect society is the spoiled-brat attitude of the egocentric Scarlett O'Hara, but she is clearly portrayed as an anomally as other characters try to put up with her antics. After the invaders from the north are shown to impose their way of life upon the south (seemingly by merely introducing industrialization, and the concept of work), Scarlett is faced with a total inability to adapt to the new society. However, with her frequent stirring speeches about never going hungry again (yeah, right, try actually living in poverty for a day or two) her inability to adapt is more a condemnation of the changes caused by the Civil War than an exploration of any weakness in Scarlett's character. Gone are the days of dances in large halls and picnics on vast tree-covered lawns (as the blacks toil under the baking sun in the far-off fields). Instead, we get scenes of poor rich people loading up buggies to move off of their plantations and into mansions inside of cities only blocks away from the (choke) working classes.In case the viewer doesn't quite get the picture of the "injustice" done to the south and thinks "what about the abolition of slavery?", every single black character in the movie is offensively portrayed as lazy, silly, and superstitious caricatures who are devoted to and love their white masters and are lost without them. The fact that "Gone With the Wind" hasn't faced as much widespread condemnation as "Birth of a Nation" with its pro-KKK scenes is rather surprising.The only reason I can figure out that such a worthless and offensive soap opera is still considered so great is that most critics are afraid to contradict decades of praise given to the movie at the risk of seeming to lack taste. I say stop being blinded by expectations or conformity and actually judge the film for what it is.

I have two cats, one was a little scared at first, but the other one took right to it and will even lay beside it on occassion when it is hot.  Now they both love it, when I first set it up, it did make a sound, but after a week when I went to clean it, I realized that is makes that sound if it is not completely full.  Now the loud sound that others complain about is gone, you have to make sure that not just the reserve part of the fountain is full but also the main container level matches water level as well. Cleaning it once a week is best, since fur can get caught as well as food bits in the main fountain.  But it is a really good fountain, it was so good that I got one for my moms new kitten!

I love this little gadget. I'm an IT professional by trade and a gadget lover in my personal life. I have a few normal laptops as well as a beefy Windows Mobile smartphone. Nevertheless, something was still missing.As a father of two children under four, it's often hard for me to spend dedicated time on my laptop, and bringing it out amongst the kids scares me. Expensive laptops are a bit bulky and easy to whack, if you catch my drift. What I needed was a device that allows me to do some basic web browsing, email, and writing while being small enough to handle easily around the kids. The Aspire One fits the bill.Now, I'll tell you a couple of things. I was very skeptical that this machine would actually be useful and bought it on a whim thinking I could return it; it has been very useful indeed. I would also be the last one to recommend an Acer-branded anything. But in netbooks, Acer has transcended the rest of its product lines and produced a nice, respectable product. The design is sharp, on par with Dell and HP, and the quality appears passable for a device in this price range.Overall, the Aspire One truly provides a portable computing experience unmatched by either a traditional laptop or a powerful smartphone. There have only been a few downsides, and they are as follows:* The machine is certainly no speed demon. Loading complex web pages, such as those with heavy Flash, tends to be a bit sluggish. I addressed this partially by switching to Firefox instead of Internet Explorer (IE). I normally use IE, but it can be unbearably slow on the Aspire One. Firefox is much better, especially in scrolling with the trackpad.* The fan is loud and annoying, and it seems to be on far too frequently. This is a common complaint about the model. I have the most updated BIOS as of 12/2008, which is suppose to address the matter, but it's still a problem for me. The noise is somewhat high pitched, I should note.* I initially experienced some severe problems with the reliability of the wireless connection (802.11g). It was dropping out every minute or so, and I was almost ready to give up and return the unit. However, I connected to the Windows update website by Microsoft, and a newer driver was available for the wireless LAN device. This update appears to have solved my problems for the most part.* The screen is sometimes just too small to carry out certain tasks pleasantly with. The horizontal resolution is great, but the vertical could use more. Even reading web pages can be somewhat laborious with all the scrolling, but this can be addressed partially by browsing in full-screen mode.All in all, this product is a good value for the money and delivers as promised. Who would have thought Acer could do it?

This review is from: Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition) (DVD)
      

I've seen most of the Pixar films. Heck, I own most of them and have seen them several dozen times because, well, I'm a parent. If you're a parent too then you'll know what I'm talking about.The Incredibles was the best Pixar film made thus far, in my opinion. It also my opinion that WALL-E is the worst so far from Pixar. The simple reason is that it is light on good story and heavy on pro-environmentalist messaging.Yes, I know this bucks the PC trend of reviewers raving how great this movie is, but honestly, I was bored. My kids thought it was "okay." After my kids saw The Incredibles they were bouncing off the walls and couldn't wait to own it. I don't think they have any interest in ever owning this movie. The message of the movie is that your typical overweight hyper-consuming American is killing the earth. This is a futuristic tale of how said fatso yanks have killed said planet, and largely don't care because they're too busy floating around in hover chairs scarfing junk food and watching TV, kind of like a lot of people do now, except in space.Oh yeah, and there's something about robots who have no identifiable reproductive organs who still want to get it on. Seriously, WALL-E must be into the whole dominatrix thing because Eve packs a heavy-duty laser cannon and ain't afraid to use it.Now before all the tree huggers freak on me, I'm all for saving the earth. I am not a hyper-consumer and I often run to work instead of drive. When I do drive, it's a 1.6 liter Honda Civic. I think environmental stewardship is important, but I don't want to be guilt tripped into it at a kid's movie.The Incredibles is everything that this movie was not. The Incredibles is a great tale of a super family who have some righteous butt-kicking adventures and it allows kids and parents alike to escape reality for a while, which is what family movies are supposed to do.If I wanted to get bummed out about the state of our environment, I'd watch An Inconvenient Truth. Pixar needs to stop with trying to insinuate their political agendas into its movies and get back to good old fashioned story telling.

This is the first fountain I'd bought, but our 17 year-old cat kept making a mess in the old water dish by pawing at the water with her front paws.  While this was cute, it made a mess. Got the fountain, she immediately abandoned the old water dish and now drinks much more water (good!) and doesn't splash in the water at all, just drinks right where the water flows out. She loves it so much - yelling and following me around the whole time I refill or clean it until it is back. The reservoir can be removed with water still in it without spilling water. Yeah, you might spill a little when putting it back, but it is okay with me.It is pricey, but highly recommended if you really love your cat!

I've spent the last few days struggling to get through this unwieldy tome, only able to read for short periods at a time before my mind clouded over from sheer boredom. I was looking forward to writing this review, but now that I've finished the book and the time has actually come, all I can feel is overwhelmed. There is just so much that is wrong. I'm almost tempted to keep my review to a couple of terse sentences. But I'll write the full version, too; if I can make it through 700-plus pages of literary torture, I'm sure I can write a half-decent review. First, the short version: Breaking Dawn is awful. Don't buy it. And now, the long version: *** SPOILERS AHEAD - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK ***First of all, it seems silly to be warning of spoilers for a book where nothing actually happens.  Someone needs to buy Stephenie Meyer a good book on writing that explains how to construct a plot... and a climax (more on that later).  But a few of some of my bigger complaints have little to do with the way the book was structured and written, and everything to do with the message behind the words. I'm pretty open-minded in my views, but I can not honestly condone any of the messages that Meyer puts forth in Breaking Dawn (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the series). If I had teenage girls who wanted to read this, I would make a concerted effort to dissuade them. Meyer seems to have forgotten who her audience is. So what's so bad with the messages in the book? Where do I start? 1. Bella gets herself pregnant. Despite the fact that she's only eighteen and that the fetus is killing her from the inside out, she stubbornly and selfishly insists on carrying the baby to term. She survives... but a real teenage girl with a high-risk pregnancy might not. Bella and the baby could have died, and she would have destroyed everyone who loved her. If she really believed she was going to be an immortal and live forever, the threat of eternal hell for having an abortion shouldn't have been an issue.As if the teenage pregnancy isn't bad enough, Bella also has the most unrealistic baby imaginable. I even caught myself thinking that maybe having a baby wouldn't be so hard. And that's what I find alarming. I'm a grown adult and the book influenced me (momentarily) that way. What are impulsive teenagers going to take from it? Bella's experience was not normal at all; she didn't have to deal with any of the negative aspects of babies. There were no diapers, no 2 AM feedings, no temper tantrums, no post-partum depression. Bella didn't even have to think about supporting the child because her husband is rich. How many real seventeen-year-old husbands can you say that about?And the way in which Bella was able to get pregnant doesn't even make sense. Vampires don't eat, don't go to the bathroom, don't sweat, don't grow hair... and yet they can somehow produce sperm from their stone testicles. Does Meyer need an anatomy textbook as well as a writing manual? (I'm all for fantasy, but it has to be plausible.) One final thought about the baby. Eighteen-year-old girls should not be allowed to name their children, because they come up with stupid names like "Renesmee". The kid's lucky she wasn't named after Edward's biological mother instead of his adoptive one. Then she would have been "Renizabeth". To be perfectly honest, though, I don't think that sounds any dumber. 2. Too much is made of physical perfection. From what I can see, the only reason that Edward is attracted to Bella is because of her looks, because she's certainly not interesting. She has no hobbies (except sex), and she even turns her nose up at admission to a prestigious university. Eternity is going to get old very fast. But, apparently, Edward doesn't seem to mind because Meyer makes it seem like a guy who can speak half a dozen languages, write music, play the piano, and otherwise improve his mind is going to be satisfied with a dullard like Bella... just as long as he can gaze at her beauty for all eternity. Bella, for her part, seems to know what a dud she is; we hear about her low self-esteem endlessly. And yet, she gets the guy anyway. What kind of message does that send to young women? Physical beauty is all that matters? That's certainly what I took from it (thank goodness I'm old enough to know better). 3. These vampires are the environment's worst nightmare.  If you're going to be around for centuries, casting aside clothes after one use, driving gas-guzzling sports cars, and taking down large game just to drain the blood... well, you're going to be using up a lot of resources. For creatures who are going to live forever, you'd think they would have a little more foresight. Or maybe I just wanted to see vampires driving a fleet of little electric cars. 4. And speaking of cars, portraying Bella's child sitting on people's laps in cars is completely irresponsible. I don't care if she's invincible. It doesn't send a good message (Britney Spears, anyone?). Besides... if Bella ever got pulled over, wouldn't it be less conspicuous if her child was buckled in safely?There were plenty of other things I didn't like, either. Edward's assertion that humans smelled more like carnivores than herbivores was most likely wrong (unless Meyer is assuming that all humans eat as many animal products as Bella did. Honestly, food other than eggs or meat barely crossed her lips. I can't see why she'd smell that good to Edward. With a diet like that, she should have smelled like rotting meat). I hated the switch in point of view right in the middle of the book. The descriptions of the wolves patrolling the forest were extremely boring. It almost seemed like a day-by-day account, and nothing was really happening. The switch was also confusing. We're told in that section how other people see Bella.  But it's not consistent with what came before and it was as if we were seeing an entirely different character. Oh, and I can't forget the whole imprinting thing.  Why are all these adult wolves imprinting on toddlers? Talk about pedophilic. I don't care that they keep insisting that they have no control over it. There is one person who does have control over it, and that's the author. It would have been weird enough if it had just happened once. But twice? I couldn't get past the feeling that these were pedophiles who were grooming their little victims until they were old enough to actually do something with. For a while, I thought that Jacob might imprint on Leah (or at least on another grown-up). But that would have been inconvenient for Meyer. Convenience. That's what this book boils down to, and that's what ultimately makes it fail. Isn't it convenient that Bella (who has no other talents to speak of) possesses the talent that can save them all? Isn't it convenient that, when she finally becomes a vampire, she can restrain herself from killing humans? Isn't it convenient that the point of view shifted in the middle of the book to Jacob's point of view? Isn't it convenient that Alice showed up at the last minute with the one person who might give the Volturi pause? Ohh... don't even get me started on the Volturi. I alluded earlier to the fact that this book has a weak plot and climax. I'll correct that statement. It has NO CLIMAX. The Volturi showed up and, aside from barbequing an inconsequential secondary character with a fancy cigarette lighter (or whatever it was), nothing happened. Nothing. They talked their way out of the predicament and left. While that may be the ideal situation to conflict in real life, in literature it just makes for boring reading. The promise of the foreshadowing is shot, and the reader just ends up frustrated. The Volturi had so much potential as villains, and that potential was completely underutilized.  The high point of the story actually came much earlier, when Bella gave birth. By that time, though, I was so frustrated with endless descriptions of wolf patrols and Bella's martyrdom that I just wanted the baby to kill her and Edward to fail. That would have at least been interesting... and I could have saved myself the hours I spent reading the last half of the novel. In short, this was a book that appears to glorify teenage marriage and parenthood, encourage disrespect for the environment and resources, and condone pedophilic tendencies... all while nothing actually happens. Bella got everything without having to sacrifice anything, and everyone lived happily forever after. If you must read Breaking Dawn, get it from the library. It irks me no end that my dollars have gone to encourage this sort of garbage to be written.

This review is from: Nights in Rodanthe [Theatrical Release] (Theatrical Release)
      

The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane periodically appears credible in the new film Nights in Rodanthe, adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the practicality and reasoning behind nearly all of their actions are unnatural. Borrowing heavily from the epic romance of 1980's Best Picture winner Out of Africa, Nights in Rodanthe fails to develop sense behind a spontaneous love affair between two unlikely candidates. Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere) feels responsible for the death of a surgery patient who died from a reaction to anesthesia. In his guilt, he agrees to drive to an isolated beach house in Rodanthe, North Carolina to meet with the husband (Scott Glenn), who has filed a lawsuit against the dispirited doctor. The trip is on the way to his ultimate destination, however, which is to retrieve his son (James Franco) from Equador, where he has moved to in order to distance himself from his disappointment with his father and his poor handling of the fated operation.Meanwhile, Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) is struggling with her two young children, who are in turn coping with their parent's recent divorce. Adrienne wants nothing to do with her unfaithful husband Jack (Christopher Meloni) who foments discontent with their children to coerce their mother into allowing him back. When Jack takes the kids for a spell, Adrienne travels to Rodanthe to look after a luxurious inn for her best friend - the same vacation house that Dr. Flanner has booked - leaving the two of them alone to slowly craft a life-changing romance.The love story that builds from so many tragedies simply isn't convincing. The unmindful, unlucky doctor meets with the distraught mother in a terrifying hurricane - what a perfect setting for romance. Even looking past the uninspired genesis, Nights in Rodanthe doesn't utilize its surprisingly short running time to develop the characters. The audience doesn't have time to become involved in their sudden affair, and the rest of their wooing takes place through voiceovers as they narrate love letters back and forth. It's like a sillier version of Out of Africa, but with more crying, less sweeping romance, and more modernized problems for the lovers to contend with. Not as lengthy and noticeably missing a moving soundtrack and score, the story has been done repeatedly (especially from Nicholas Sparks); as a motion picture it is simply not ambitious enough to create a worthwhile movie-going experience.- Mike Massie

Having never had a pedometer before I don't have anything to compare it to. I found it easy to program, easy to use, apparently accurate and able to withstand at least a few gentle falls to the floor.

I first tried the Zymox without hydrocortisone.  That didn't really seem to clear up my dog's infection completely.  This product worked alot better. The hydrocortisone took away the itch, and thus kept my dog from scratching her ears, which let them heal faster!  I highly recommend Zymox.  It's so much more affordable than those expensive antibiotics from the vet, and more effective as well.

I bought Season 4 and discovered I had only bought the first half of Season 4.  This wasn't clear when I ordered.  If I had known, I might have waited till all came out.  I'm not looking forward to ending the shows halfway and then having to wait another 6-9 months.

Although the movie maintains the integrity of the book pretty well, it comes across as a cheap imitation.  Bella stutters and blinks throughout the whole movie, which was VERY annoying.  Some of the scenes were so contrived and cheesy, that one had to laugh.  The movie has enjoyed so much popularity, I think, in part because the actors are very attractive, and it is an anguished love story, with Edward playing the part of the perfect gentleman, every woman's fantasy.  I loved the Twilight saga in book form, but I have to admit that the movie seemed very low budget.  I hope, considering Twilight's success, that with a new director and larger budget, New Moon will be a production of higher quality and standards.  Still, Twilight isn't bad if your looking to kill a few hours with silly entertainment in the movie theater.

I purchased MacSpeech Dictate and too had the "crash on creating a new profile" problem. Basically it turned out the company was issuing defective, encrypted data disks. Once I got through to the company by their phone line (emails to support went unanswered), they promised me a replacement disk by FedEX. Well, a week later I got the replacement disk!So I fired up Dictate today and started "training" it on my voice. It came to the end of training and said it was ready to go. I then tried saying a few simple things into Microsoft Word. It got the first few words and then really couldn't recognize anything after that. It seems less-capable than iListen of two years ago. The software, in fact, cannot recognize me saying COMMA at all! Software seems like an ALPHA rather than a 1.0 version of anything. My recommendation is don't buy until there is a 2.0 release, if then. Oh and yes, I am using a "certified" headset. Would have been real nice for them to have a page listing certified headsets rather than just me having to go through press releases to find headset-certification announcements! mz

I remember the days of the first &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook">iBook&lt;/a>. That thing was ugly. It was low powered and pretty much sucked. Those days are long gone. The New MacBook is Gorgeous and blazing fast. Some people won't like the changes but I love them. The improved graphics and overall design is fantastic. The glossy screen pops more than the previous model as long as you can avoid glare and the lack of firewire and other useless old ports won't be missed by me. Obviously the &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/21/macbook-and-macbook-pro-review/2">MacBook Pro&lt;/a> is a better machine and has all the pro features you'd expect. Honestly on this model I'd love to see the DVD drive go away and have more hard drive space and have internet access through the iPhone. This will not be mistaken for a Dell. Maybe with all the money you save when you buy a Dell you can buy Windows 7 when it comes out, but probably not.

This device comes with a disk that is supposed to help you go through the setup.  It refused to believe that the router was properly connected.  I did get a very nice person at Linksys that got me through the basic set up.  From there it all worked very well.The speed of the N band is incredible.  I have a laptop setup for  N in the 5 gig band.  I've run some of the standard bandwidth tests (CNet most of the time).  The laptop tests at about 90% of the speed the desktop gets.  Sometimes better than 95%.  They are on different floors.I was able to get the USB port to work,  I've seen clearer instructions but I muddled through.  I would have given it 5 stars if the supplied program had worked.

It does work very well but international travelers need to know it is 120 VOLT 60 HERTZ only. I use it with a travel transformer, but because other countries use 50 Hz (transformers do not adjust frequency) it pulses slower than in the US, but it still gives satisfactory performance. The lower frequency will probably shorten the pump motors life, but because it works so well, I can live with that. The manufacturers website gave NO Information about the voltage and frequency for this unit and that is why I give only 4 stars.My vendor was J&R MUSIC AND COMPUTER WORLD and I give them my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION for fast responsive service to APO and FPO addresses. I would have purchased directly from Amazon, but I live on a Forward Operating Camp in Iraq and Amazon does not ship most items to APO addresses.

My kitten and my dog love this waterer.  My former cat (deceased) played in it constantly.  This is my third one of these.  They seem to last about a little over a year and then you need a new one as your pets miss it dreadfully.  I also have the extras that can be purchased to provide additional water storage.

TurboTax Deluxe 2008 does not support investments so if you bought or sold stocks, you must get premier. This is unlike previous years. It seems that they tried to sneak several things in to get more money. Until recently (after many complaints) they were charging you to print your taxes on your own printer. so if you wanted a paper copy or to give it a lookover, more $$$ for Intuit. At a certain point you have to wonder if it is worth it. By the way, I also called the company to verify. This program is designed with hidden charges and less functionality than previous editions. As such, if you want to be nickle and dimed, buy this product. I know what I am going to do, return my product.

This is everything I want it to be. The problem is really user related. It is great that it works inside the pocket but it is so easy to forget to take the pedometer out of your pocket before we put our pants in the laundry. It sometimes takes a few washings without a problem but eventually, they fail. What does it mean when you put a battery inside a hot dryer? Nothing has happened so far but I wonder about it. I have replaced four pedometers so far. Otherwise, it's a great incentive and reliable so I continue to replace it.

READ THIS REVIEW AND AVOID A COSTLY MISTAKE- Save your money and keep your Mach 3- Replacement blades don't last as long as the one that comes with the razor, this is a pervasive complaint and something I've also determined when I buy a  new razor handle and blade when traveling versus the replacement blades.- The blade is so fat, you can't use it under the nose for the mustache, this is why it comes with the "single precision blade" cause their focus group told them the same thing, instead of improving it they just gave you a single blade razor on your five blade overpriced replacement.- Blades are too close to clean, you'll waste a gallon of water just trying to free cut hair from between the blades, THE MORE WATER YOU RUN THE BLADE UNDER THE QUICKER YOU OXIDIZE THE CUTTING SURFACE AND RUIN THE BLADE / SO GO BUY MORE REPLACEMENTS.- Another reviewer said it and it is true, you can interchange the Power and Manual versions so if you insist on using this razor, you can buy THE MANUAL VERSION replacement for the Fusion Power handle.- Save your money, and keep your Mach 3 !!!!

The manufacturer recommends replacing the foil screen and cutter block every 18 months for maximum performance. I wholeheartedly agree. This cutting system seems to last a little longer than older models but it certainly doesn't last forever. While it might not be exactly at 18 months, you can readily tell that the blades are getting dull when it takes longer to shave and/or you begin experiencing skin irritation. The set is pretty expensive but Amazon.com seems to have a very competitive price (a lot cheaper than I've seen in any brick & mortar store). Having said that, it really is like getting a brand new razor each time you make the change so it's very worthwhile doing it. Not sure if you can even buy them separately, but changing both parts at the same time ensures a closer shave with less skin irritation because they work together as an integrated system.

Transporter is such an amazing film, a real surprise, great timing, interesting story, and just the right amount of action. Fast forward to version 3, and everything just feels wrong.The opening 10 or 15 minutes pack some interesting story line, decent action, that car crashing through Frank's living room wall was incredible. From there the film just goes down hill. The real turning point, Frank starts talking to Valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuses to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). Finally she talks about food at a restaurant. It's foreshadowing, but she does talk about carrots a lot. And sadly the only thought this reviewer and his two sons had was, well does that help her keep her red hair and freckles? Sad but true, the movie just completely lost it's way at this point.The action scenes are exciting and pitiful at the same time. The excitment is in the chase and the rapid fire editing, slick cars, beautiful scenery, and pulsating music and sound. The awful part, and this absolutely kills these sequences, so much sped up motion was used as to make these scenes almost stupid. Sped up and slo-mo fighting scenes were tiresome. The worst was the driving on two wheels between the two semi's stunt - plain old, flat out, stupid, defying all laws of physics and the darn CG effect was too obvious. It's a sad movie when the viewer can actually see the light green tint around the edge of the actors in front of a green screen (just about every in car conversation is plagued with this). If the action had been furious enough, the dialog compelling, the story interesting; the green screen effect would have faded away. Instead it's out there in the open, made even visible on Blu-Ray.There's a ton of continuity issues, where things don't match from one scene to the next. Frankly, this reviewer has never seen a longer list for any other movie that that internet movie database. T 3 has probably set a record for the most (there are over 30 goofs). Natalya Rudakova is just not a very good actress, her delivery of lines is flat and almost read from the script. She is not really that beautiful, certainly not somebody that Frank should be attracted to. The reviewer found himself noticing the dark marks on her lips, either cold sores or freckles. It's very sad when a lead actress just isn't captivating. Jason Statham is the only reason this film gets two stars. This is essentially a guy movie, not really a date film. Jason taking his shirt off several times, well just wasn't a smart move; it plays to the wrong audience. The fishing scene with the French police inspector is charming. Him driving an old Renault 6 is also an interesting contrast. The other characters are just flat.The film is rated PG-13. There is no nudity. The f bomb is in a subtitle once. There's plenty of violence, a fair amount of blood, and several times where a person is shown being shot. Given that the movie is so bad, it's probably smart to respect the age guideline. Blu-Ray was a mixed blessing for this film. The sound is incredible. It will excercise your subwoofer. The gun shots and fighting sounds are significantly higher volume than the dialog. The high resolution of Blu-Ray shows all the bad / cheap CG effects the director chose. On DVD, these might not have been as visible. The Blu-Ray disc includes some really lame Mogolo (apologies for not spelling this correctly) piece of junkware software. It took a good solid 15 minutes (at 12Mbps very fast internet connection) to download the program. It appears to allow a person to view a clip of the film, store it, add some graphics, and then share it with others. After step 12 in the demo, this reviewer gave up totally. Cr__ware experiments just keep happening with Blu-Ray. Maybe one day soon the authors of this junk will settle down to just show the movie in all it's HiDef glory.

I bought this item for my wife, who has multiple sclerosis. She's trying to keep track of her walking distances and the number of steps she takes. Because her gait is awkward, by normal standards, and her pace is very slow, the Omron device is not able to accurately track her steps or distance. Although the unit works fine (I tested it myself), it does not work for the person who wanted it and could have benefited from it the most.

I've been purchasing with Amazon.com for nine years and this product is so awful I feel compelled to write my first review.  The packaging implies you'll be connected within minutes.  The product offers no manual whatsoever and only an installation disk.  The disk prompts you on which cords to unhook from your current router and where to plug them in on your new router, and then prompts you to turn on the router.  The prompt icon spins for over ten minutes only to tell you there is no connection to the Internet.  There isn't a word of technical support provided other than "make sure everything is plugged in."  If I didn't want my money back, I'd use this piece of junk as a paperweight.  Please note that I wasn't able to leave no stars.  One star is far too good a rating and I apologize for any miscommunication.  Worst. Purchase. Ever.

This is an attractive, compact, 500 gig external hard drive. A nice chrome sturdy and well built product. setup was simple and very very easy. It is a very quite drive in operation. It dose very well what a hard drive is expected to do. The drive was well packaged and arrived the exact day that it was estimated to be here, i had it up and running within 5 minutes. This is not the drives fault but the back up software simply sucks. It is difficult to set up and i could not get it to finish a back up without it erroring out. I ended up using nero's software for my back up's. 4 stars rating is because of the software.

This review is from: Transformers (DVD)
      

Warning: Only for Transformers fans! I should never have bought this DVD, replete with potholes so large the whole thing could fall into another dimension. Jon Voight, John Turturro, Shia LaBeouf, and Josh Duhamel do what they can with this shallow material, earning enough to buy more cars and summer homes. Do yourself a favor and get any "Riddick" film, or the superb "Equilibrium" instead. This kid stuff degenerates into fantasy disguised as Sci-Fi, covered up by layers of special effects.The best role is that of "Mojo," a broken-legged Chihuahua who would have saved the film if he'd been the sole story. Ultimately, the Cube is a big "so what," and the Transformers, supposedly beings of higher intelligence, call themselves ridiculous names like Optimus Prime. Schmaltz Alert: A good laugh derived from a scene so filled with Spielbergian Schmaltz as to seem a Spielberg Parody. But no, in the corny School of Spielberg, director Michael Bay delivers a scene with: a tiny blonde girl, a purple "My Pony," and a bag placed under a pillow labeled "My Tooth." But it can't stop there, on no, she must simper and ask one of the clumsy, unscary aliens, "Are you the Tooth Fairy?" Spare yourself.

For those of us parents who were expecting a movie as thoroughly enjoyable as Toy Story or Monsters Inc., which was highly entertaining for both the parents AND their preschool-aged children, this was a HUGE disappointment. None of us--my husband, I, and our children--enjoyed the movie. Having 3 little boys, I was excited by the prospect of a movie about robots made by Pixar. What better combination, I thought. Unfortunately, the movie is not about Wall-E or his story. It's about staring at the earth filled with mountains of garbage and watching a nearly personality-less robot make these mountains of garbage for extremely long periods of time. Since when have I ever sat in a movie theater and thought..."Okay, surely the story is going to start any moment" only to find out it never does? This is a first! Pixar failed miserably in utilizing a potentially great character to weave a cautionary tale--they wasted Wall-E! Instead of inspiring the spirit to take care of the earth, Pixar has nearly satirized the environmentalist message through the painfully long landscape scenes and lack of plot. The movie belabors the obvious. The robots are uninteresting and barely qualify as characters. Wall-E lacks the humor, excitement, and classic story-telling techniques I have come to expect from Pixar. This movie is certainly outside Pixar's box, and for that reason we were terribly disappointed.

I wish I could give this a no star rating. When I got this mixer I loved it! It was quiet and efficient.  But i used it for a litte more than a year and rarely at that.  I didn't even use it once a month.  Now it's dead and just refuses to turn on.   I should have paid attention to the reivews when I bought it but I didn't, now I'm stuck and the company refuses to do anything. The one I had previos to this one was not even a major brand I picked up at the local Wal-Mart for about $10.  It lasted for about 15 years.

This is the third Waterpik I've ordered. This one disappoints. The pressure is lower than my previous one. The water container is smaller and usually has to be refilled to finish the job. It is smaller overall and fits in the bathroom much easier, but if you want performance look for the previous model or wait until Waterpik fixes this one.

I do not recommend this microwave.  I have to say that this slightly pricey microwave, compared to other brands and models, look really classy with its shiny touches.  It's a nice looking microwave, but that's about it.  This microwave gives off a loud buzzing sound during cooking and the door is a bit loose around the hinges.  The door can literally be shaken while the door is closed.  Another issue I have with it is that it cooks much slower than the microwave I have at work.  When I cook a TV dinner platter, the food is never heated in accordance to the time the box says it should cook (even when I use the maximum recommended time).  When I microwaved the same type of TV dinner at work (a smaller microwave model), it cooked at the minimum recommended cooking time.  With this Sharp R-216LS, I always have to add an extra minute to the recommended cooking time--a waste of energy.  Luckily I don't use the microwave for much except once in a blue moon TV dinner.

We found this coffee maker really does work well, lives up to it's claims. The machine is easy to use, clean and program. It even tells you in the instructions that the #4 filters will be slightly large for the coffee basket-just pushing down on the filter bottom will make it fit the basket appropriately. The vacuum pitcher works incredibly well, really amazing how thermally efficient it is.When our Bunn coffee maker went on the blink at work, I purchased a second Zojirushi for the office.

I own a Dell Dimension 4400 that I purchased new in 2002. It had Microsoft works 2002 6.  As of Jan. 09 I will be publishing a club newsletter. The prior publisher had purchased a "publishing" program for around $100.00.  I did not want to spend that much money and she suggested buying an updated works program as an alternative.  She had used Amazon.com before and guided me in my purchase.  My new software arrived in about 2 days, I uninstalled my 6. and installed my new 9.  My whole experience was very positive and the email notice of my credit for having used Amazon was a nice surprize.  Thank you.  Sandy

I bought this mouse as a replacement for my Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer which I've had for almost 8 years now. It finally developed a short in the cord and cuts out occasionally. Other then that it still works perfectly. Imagine my disappointment when right out of the box I noticed that the bottom button bellow the mouse wheel on the Habu stuck in the down position the very first time it was depressed. Definitely not the quality I was expecting.I decided to go ahead and try to install it anyway. I was really curious to see if it was as tough as everyone is saying. IT IS!!! I consider myself pretty good with computers. I have built several of them. This was by far the toughest install I've dealt with. Even with following some instructions I found on the internet step by step, it still failed to recognize the mouse and upgrade the firmware. I finally had success (quite by accident) after uninstalling the Habu software, installing the software update from razer and then flashing the firmware. Basically follow the instructions in Adams review and you should be fine. I wish I had read them before wasting 3 hours of my life.So now it works. How good is it? The mouse itself is very comfortable. I like the interchangeable side buttons. I opted for the buttons further to the rear. The scroll wheel and left and right buttons all work fine and have a nice feel to them. The major complaint I have is with the two buttons below the wheel. The bottom one sticks and even the top button has a "cheap" feeling click to it. The tracking for the cursor is very smooth and precise.Now on to the software. The UI is ugly and tacky but is fairly straight forward and easy to figure out. The biggest disappointment here is with the standard options for the buttons. There are no options for forward, back, close or minimize. All of these were available on my 8 year old mouse. I ended up having to make and assign macros to each button to get everything to work the way I wanted. The macros function itself was a bit buggy. Sometimes they would work and sometimes not. After redoing them several times it seems to have "taken" and is working OK. It's just allot of hassle to go through to get to what I feel should be a standard option.Amazon is sending me a replacement. I will see if the sticky button was just a fluke. Pros: Nice LookingComfortableExcellent tracking and precisionCons: Extremely difficult installSticky button "cheap" feelLack standard options for button assignmentsExpensiveLack of tech support

I purchased the 320gb Iomega "prestige" drive against my better judgment since I have recently had poor results from Iomega drives (two failures in three months.) This drive is not prestigious but is instead a low end poorly made drive. The usb female port in the drive is poorly made and does not hold onto the male end of the cable. I could I suppose attach some electrical tape to the cable and try to secure it to the drive, but that sounds like a poor choice when we're talking about important date transfers. So I called customer service, they said, sorry, we can only exchange the device (no refunds) and I had to pay the return charges. Tried to speak to a supervisor, but he was "unavailable" (after a five minute hold). These are tough times and those sort of answers are a clear signal (along with a shoddily  produced product) that Iomega is not the company that one wants to use these days for data storage. So potential buyers BEWARE.

I own an older version of this product, and its performance has been stellar over the years. However, I have needed a replacement bowl cover and bowl for many months because the bowl cover is coming apart at the rim (something that happened fairly early on, I might add) and the bowl's safety mechanism is missing the appropriate stop making it a matter of having to hold the lid in place with one hand while pushing food through the chute with the other, otherwise the cover slips out of place and the processor shuts off. Worse still is when the bowl cover slips past the broken off stop, making the lid impossible to remove without inserting a small screw driver and manually pushing the safety lever in the handle of the bowl down while sliding the lid back into place. Since they are no longer actively manufacturing my version, which is less than seven years old, I have found it impossible to find a replacement for the bowl cover, which I know has been on back-order since at least May of 2007. Kitchenaid promised replacements by January of 2008, and now has revised the date to April 2008. You should be aware, if you purchase one of these products, that replacement parts may be exceedingly difficult to obtain as your processor gets older. This may be true of other brands as well, I don't know, but I have finally decided to give up waiting for my replacement parts to come and have purchased another food processor OF ANOTHER BRAND. I know one thing, I will NEVER buy another Kitchenaid product, based on how poorly they have handled this backorder issue. And I am not alone. There is a huge backorder for the bowl cover, so it is a design flaw they cannot overcome and will not admit to, in my estimation. Instead they leave their customers hanging in limbo with no answers and no way to make full use of one of their products, and a fairly expensive one at that. Beware.

I have been a user of Turbo Tax for over 10 years.  What TT needs to know is that customer loyalty is built on providing a consistent product at a reasonable price.  For example, if I purchase TT Deluxe year after year I expect that product to have the same or increased functions.  I should not find out after I purchase the product that it no longer supports Sched D or C or that I now have to pay to print additional returns for my children.  I HAVE HAD IT WITH TT!!! I am using TaxCut for 2008 and it imported my 2007 TT data and it works just fine at less cost.

I purchased this D-Link DIR-655 router to replace a failing Netgear unit that was about 4 years old.  I purchased it after reading rave reviews in several technical publications, including Maximum PC Magazine.  I have spent numerous hours of my time, and the time of my more tech-savvy friends, trying to get it to work - at all.  The symptom I experience is that I can see the router, and get into it's setup, etc., but I cannot see or get any access at all to the internet.I have had tech support on a call for over 1 hour from D-Link, who claim the problem is with my ISP.  I have had my ISP tech staff on a call twice, for over an hour who cannot really help because a) it's not a router I am renting from them (though they supply d-Link themselves, but not this model), and b) since there is no connectivity at all, they cannot remote-link in and see what is going on.  They claim it's some conflict between the router and something else running on my system - but not their problem since I can connect directly without any router - which does make some sense.  I have downloaded the firmware and upgraded it; actually replaced it since my device shipped with the most current version supposedly already loaded.  All to no avail.At this point, I have worked so long on this that I can no longer return it to Amazon.  As part of this experience, I have also looked at a LOT of blogs and have found that my experience is NOT unique with this device.  Many who are clearly more technical than I am have been unable to get thgis device to work, or work reliably.  The concensus is "buy something else". In that regard, the only recommendation seems to be "buy Cisco" - which works fine for those wbale/willing to pay $1K+ for a router - I cannot.I am going back to Netgear, though, again, the Blogs are not very comforting in terms of the the "N Gigabit" model from them either.Amazon should NOT sell this device till D-Link gets their act together with the product, and their technical support of the product.

I bought this for my dorm room and it works very well. It has a good range for its type, though it seems to be slightly shorter than my friend's Netgear one (although this could just be because of room arrangements). Had one issue where it gave only local access, but the old unplug-replug trick worked and I haven't had any other problems. The size and shape are very convenient since it can sit in a small out-of-the-way place. It's also very easy to set up.

Linksys and all other router manufacturers advertises the greatness of the wireless 5ghz band (especially with 802.11n), but I'm beginning to have my doubts.  It is true that the 5Ghz band is hardly being used so you'll have virtually no one to compete with,.  However, the 5Ghz distance in no way compares to 2.4Ghz, and as a matter of fact, I find it to be quite terribe.  At approximately 20 feet away, both my Linksys DMA2200 and HP notebooke barely get 1 bar using the 5Ghz N band with my WRT610N router.  In comparison, while only using my 2.4Ghz WRT54g router, I get 5 full bars at that range, and at least 2 bars from anywhere else in my house. I have all Linksys equipment in my house as I have been impressed with all of their 2.4Ghz in the past.  However, I've recently upgraded everything to dual-band N equipment and found numerous flaws in each of the new devices, plus none of them really even play well together.  My setup is: Linksys 610n router, DMA2200 media center extender, and a WUSB600N Dual-Band Wireless-N USB Network Adapter for my laptop - all of which are currently using the most up-to-date firmware. Other devices include a WRE54G extender and  Nintendo Wii.Problem  #1) The LELA software with the new N devices doesn't even recognize that my DMA2200 is a media center extender.  Using LELA, I should be able to select my media extender and allocate more bandwidth for streaming media.  However, since my extender only shows up as an "unknown network device" those options are greyed out.  I tried to manually change the device to a media center, but still no go.  I suppose you can manually allocate bandwidth in the router setup somewhere, but considering these are all Linksys products, it's absolutely ridiculous that an option specifically incorporated in the LELA software for a Linksys Media Extender does not work!!!  Problem #2) If you are only using one system with the router, the router might actually work as intended.  For most of us though there are going to be at least 2 or more systems connected to the router (wired, wireless, or a combination of the two) such as a PS3, Wii, laptop, PC, media extender, Xbox, etc.  If that's the case, you're probably screwed because you WILL experience frequent dropouts... ESPECIALLY if just one those clients is a VISTA machine.   Check the linksys forums and you will find that this seems to be a problem with all of the new linksyss routers (610N, 310N, and 110).  Here is a microsoft article that explains the problem [...] do to a problem with the way VISTA accepts DHCP requests from certain routers.  Unfortunately, there is no real fix for this, even with the suggested registry modification which really doesn't fix the problem.Problem #3) Because of  problem #2 I will never be able to get rid of the dropouts since my network is using one of Linksys's media center extenders.  The DMA2200 is essentially a VISTA PC to some extent and accepts DHCP requests the same as a VISTA PC.  Since it is not really a PC though, there is no registry modification that can be done to alleviate the VISTA problem (not hat the registry mod really works anyways).  So as long as I try to use my DMA2200 wirelessly with my WRT610N router, the frequent dropouts will occur and there's nothing I can do about it.  This is REALLY TERRIBLE since the DMA2200 is specifically designed to be used with the WRT610N router in order to take advantage of the 5Ghz band and wireless N transfer rates.  You absolutely need 5Ghz wireless N to effeciently stream HDTV WIRELESSLY, but if you lose your connection every 10 minutes, it is impossible to watch any type of streaming media.Problem #4) As mentioned already, when the "N" 5Ghz range is working on the WRT510N router, the distance sucks compared to standard 2.4Ghz G, N or mixed mode networks.  You can try to make it better by strictly using N products, disabling the 2.4ghz band all-to-gether, and using the wider 40mhz frequency, but it doesn't really help.  The higher 5Ghz band is a more concentrated signal and therefore simply does not reach as far as the lower 2.4ghz band.  I wonder why all of these new products state that the 5Ghz range will increase your distance, when in fact it actually makes it worse?  So... basically, this router does nothing that it claims too and is basically rendered useless on any network with a VISTA machine.  This has not been addressed by any Linksys firmware updates or VISTA software updates so there is no reason to even consider using this router if you you're using VISTA or some type of VISTA Media Center Extender such as the Linksys DMA2200. Although, I've always sworn by Linksys in the past, the amount of wasted time, frustration, and horrible support has really changed my view about them.  I've reverted back to my old trustworthy WRT54g router and had to run cable through my house so that I wouldn't have to box my DMA2200 extender up and let it collect dust in the attic.  It's really disappointing that I spent all this money to buy this equipment specifically because they're supposed to work together, but in fact they don't.  Plus what's the point of having top notch wireless equpment if you have to run cables in order for them to work?

Using TT Deluxe 2008, I imported my 2007 Taxcut information and then proceeded to enter most of my 2008 data.  However, when I attempted to enter in that I received a 2007 state refund which should be taxable because I itemized on my Federal return in 2007, Turbotax indicated that I did not itemize in 2007.  There is no way to correct this information in Turbotax short of redoing my entire return (according to the support person I spoke with on the phone).  Based on posts on Intuit's "Live Community" many others are experiencing this problem.

I used this on a Cocker Spaniel, two chihuahuas and a cat.  The cat had the most dramatic results - it was like taking another animal off her and her coat looked fantastic.  The cocker didn't have quite the same dramatic effect, but she didn't shed much in the first place.  The two Chis shed like crazy and while I didn't pull off a whole pile of hair, I did notice a pretty significant reduction in shedding over the following week.  Also, my chi who hates being brushed, actually really enjoyed being brushed by the FURminator.  Overall a purchase worth the money.

I bought this product based on mostly good reviews written here.  After using it for a few weeks I'm disappointed.First, it's erratic.  The heart rate bounces around in a huge range.Second, it only gives a reading about half the time, and that reading is often so erratic it can't be believed.  I know you have to moisten the sensor areas, but I've done that and it doesn't help much.  In an intense workout where I'm sweating a lot, it gives a more consistent readout, but still not 100%.  If I keep using it I'm going to have to buy some kind of lube to apply on the sensors so I can get a more consistent readout.Bottom line:  I'm very disappointed in this purchase, and wish I'd spent a few dollars more to get something marginally decent.

I've been wanting to try one of these collars for a while, and finally decided on this one. I was kind of disappointed, but then again, I guess you get what you pay for. I can never get this thing to work properly on a continual basis. It seems to have a mind of it's own on if it will work or not. Just testing before even putting the collar on my dog, 6 time out of 10 it wouldn't work (testing the tone)The push button for the on/off could have been designed better, and the buttons on the remote are kind of sensitive. Just slightly pressing the button, the light would come on, but not send a signal to the collar.I wouldn't buy this again. But maybe I just got a bad unit

Although I am not sure why you need a turbo button, when it seems to me it should be on full vacuum all the time, it is an excellent beard and mustache trimmer/shaver.

Small, looks great, quiet, it's everything you want in an external drive.  Just don't turn it off.  Each time it turned off, whether manually or by power failure, I could not get the drive to turn back on.  The button does not work.  One review said WD told him to hit the box as the power switch hangs up.  If I hit is a few times, it lights up as if there was no problem.  This is not the way a $200+ device should operate.  I have no confidence in this drive as a backup. January 28 Update... It has been one week and five business days since I asked WD about the problem with the My Book Studio Edition.  Despite two follow up notes to them and a claim of one day response to most questions, there has been no response.  If I could edit the stars the rating would now drop to one star.

I don't know how I cooked without this!! Saves your arm from the hurt of either mixing by hand or holding up a hand mixer! I think if you buy one, you'll have it for life. Great durable quality- comes in beautiful colors too. I have the much coveted, long discontinued Violet. Looks fabulous in my kitchen! I didn't order this from Amazon, I got it from Kitchen Aid directly and I have to say I had nothing but problems with them. :( I would probably never buy another item from them directly, but would consider buying their products from another source, such as here. I have only had this for a short time, but I have made cake, homemade frosting and artichoke dip, which I couldn't be more greatful for my mixer.. saved me from hand mixing cream cheese! I can't wait to make more things! I also love that you can buy additional accessories to attatch. I am going to buy the grinder attatchment to make homemade baby food and grind my own meat. It is well worth the price for the quality and the durability you get.

I saw this film purely on great buzz. It made many 'top 10' lists in 2008 and I was curious about this film that I'd never heard of. I never saw a trailer and all I had to go on was a couple of wonderful reviews and a small blurb of a synopsis.I am very open-minded when it comes to film. I love the horror genre as well as anything to do with vampires. And I usually like foreign horror. But I admit I was entirely dissapointed in Let The Right One In. It starts out promising but after that I felt nothing for the film, nor its characters.This is not a horror film and should not be labeled as such. I'm not even talking about shock and gore. I'm talking about atmosphere. It was lacking. There was no sense of foreboding, no real mystery, nothing that made your spine tingle. Yes, it is a romance of sorts and while it may be interesting in that regard, it still felt lacking. The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of Eli. She is a vampire and she is 12 and has been for quite a while. That's all we know. I did some research after the film and found out from people that read the actual book what exactly happens to her. Her backstory sounded more heartbreaking than this entire film.Without it, Eli was just a mysterious little vampire with an ambiguous past. The acting was pretty good and I thought the actors who portrayed Eli and the bullied Oskar did a great job in that regard. When Eli very briefly reveals something pretty darn important about her past, it is not questioned by Oskar for even a second. Not even the fact that she is a vampire deters him or makes him blink. Some would call that sweet and romantic. I would call it unrealstic in any case. I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish, and maybe the actual book is very good, but as a movie, it feels very lacking and the ending leaves much to be desired. I swear Oskar's fate will be just like Eli's other caretaker/father/whatever he was supposed to be. And that is hardly what I would call a love story.

This coffee maker is excellent.  It makes great tasting coffee quickly, and keeps it hot for hours.  I usually fire it up around 8:15A and it is still warm enough for an afternoon cup at 3:30P.  It will not overflow if the carafe is not seated precisely in the right position, as happened frequently with my last coffee maker.  The sneak-a-cup feature works fine, but usually drips one drop each time i use it.  Its only cumbersome feature is the cap on the carafe.  I find it difficult to grasp and turn.  May not be the best choice for someone with weak hands.  That being said, this coffee maker is a good value and I would recommend it to others.

Best of all, KitchenAid makes quality products to pass down from one generation to the next.  These mixers are made to last.

I enjoyed the first Madagascar, even though in places I thought it just a wee bit inappropriate for children.For the second installment, the producers seem to have zoomed in on all the moderately offensive bits of the first, and blown them way out of proportion in the second.  I guess they are just doing what anyone who wants to make money will do: pander to base human nature.  But this is aimed at kids, and I kinda draw the line there.The movie has several instances of suggestive sexual inuendo that go way beyond the border of acceptability for children. And top it off with the "misunderstood, underappreciated dancer gets to save the day with his 'art'...", and a clearly male character who not just suggests gener role reversal, but three times while dressed in women's "attire" says "I'm a lady..." and "Which of you is attracted to me?"And a "hunky hunky hippo" getting his Fabio groove on, coming up out of the water with closeups of his "hairy muscular chest" and "tight (but large) 'buns'...", and suggestive music with lyrics like "I like 'em big... I like 'em chunky.  I like 'em big. I like 'em plumpy...  I like 'em spunky..."Can someone please tell me who, at DreamWorks, thought this would be good for children?And while it's true (like everyone says) that the Penguins definately delivered in this movie, that's just not enough to prevent this being a single-rent DVD for us.

Don't buy this if you think your power will ever go out, or you might pull the plug.My hard drive was getting full. I had lots of family photos and music files and various other stuff.  So i bought the Western Digital 500GB My Book and 'moved' 62G of files onto it.  A week later I go to find something and there are no, zero nada files on it.  I do notice that the drive letter shows that there is only 420GB free.  First help person says, did you ever unplug it.  Sure I say, afterall it's a hard drive like the one in your PC you should be able to turn off power.  He says oh your data is gone then!!!! I tell him that there must be something on there taking up that space but he doesn't understand me so i ask him to escalate (we're dealing with India now).  Finally after several hours and requests to escalate since I know there is data on there, I get a very smart person who understands right away what i am saying regarding only 420GB free, must be data on the drive.  He has me run some sort of scan and it finds all my files!!!! Whoohoo right?Wrong, it just finds the data, and gives them new filenames like 000001.chk, 000002.chk, 000003.cha and so on for 30,000 files or so.  The help desk guy then sympathises and recommends some software, you can purchase, that will go through all the files and put the correct extensions on them.So hour and days later i have 3,000 .txt files with no names, and 2,000 .jpg files and 5,000 .ppt .... and so on.  Now i get to open each one and name it appropriately.Do you want to go through this experience?  If you have no fear that your power will ever go out, or you'll accidently pull the plug then go ahead, buy it.I do own a Maxtor exernal for my other PC, 2 years now, multiple power downs and no data loss.

The router works flawlessly after a very challenging set up adventure.   The initial set up attempt was unsuccessful.  I use the Vista Home Premium operating system.  After 2 days of trying to configure the wireless set up using the Linksys provided configuration tool, I gave up.  Wired set up was not a problem.  After configuring the router for wireless operation with my laptop, the router recognized every wireless appliance on the network except for the laptop that I used to configure the router.  I gave up after 2 days of unsuccessful attempts.  Then I  switched to the Windows Vista wireless configuration tool, and I was up and running in less than 5 minutes.

The U3 spam software is insanely annoying.The stick is too wide and crowds out other devices next to it trying to connect via USB.Get the Kingston DataTraveler instead

I got my creative Zen a couple of days ago and I'm nothing but amazed.  The Zen is smaller than I expected and the screen just looks great, bright colors, nice interface, excellent sound quality, easy to use... the only thing I regret is not getting the 16gb :(I'm glad I didn't get the iPod..
